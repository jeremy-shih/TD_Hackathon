[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and is being broadcast live over the Internet at www.fiserv.com. In addition, there are supplemental materials for today's call available at the company's website. To access those materials, go to the company's website at www.fiserv.com, and click on the earnings call link in the Events section of the home page. The call is expected to last about an hour and you may disconnect from the call at any time.","Now I will turn the call over to Peter Holbrook, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Peter Holbrook","Thank you, Carol. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. With me on today's call is our CEO, Jeff Yabuki; our CFO, Tom Hirsch; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted revenue, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, free cash flow per share, sales pipelines, acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release, which can be found on our website at fiserv.com, for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon. On the heels of our strong finish to 2011, we delivered revenue growth and adjusted EPS that exceeded our internal expectations for the quarter. We are pleased with our start to the year and are well-positioned to achieve results within our full-year guidance.","Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the quarter and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4%, including solid results in both our Payments and Financial segments. Adjusted earnings per share was up 18% for the quarter to $1.20, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points over the first quarter of 2011.","Free cash flow was $183 million in the quarter, below the outstanding results in the comparative quarter, primarily related to relative changes in working capital. Cash flow remains on track for the year. In February, we reinforced our commitment to building shareholder value through an additional repurchase authorization for 10 million shares. To that end, we also repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter.","We have established 3 key enterprise priorities to help you better gauge our current performance and strategic progress in 2012. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients. Adjusted internal revenue growth of 4% matched our strong fourth quarter performance and accelerated from 3% in the first quarter of 2011. Growth in the quarter was driven by recurring revenue in our Debit and Account Processing businesses, along with solid performance across our digital channels, reflecting strong demand for mobile banking solutions and the industry's renewed focus on Online Banking.","Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, leading to higher operating margin and another quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Strengthening the foundation of our growth culture leads to better results now and into the future. We are executing against our go-to-market strategy, which is well aligned with technology and consumer trends.","As proof points of the market demand, we signed a combined 230 Payments clients to our bill payment, debit and P2P solutions in the quarter, and nearly 150 clients selected our market-leading mobile solution. We also had 2 additional large credit unions commit to Acumen, our next-generation account processing platform in the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strong interest in this advanced technology platform, and as important, the significant number of additional solutions that are being purchased along with the core.","Last week, we hosted over 3,600 attendees at our 2012 spring client event, Fiserv Forum. This event will end up being one of the largest gatherings of financial institution executives in the U.S. this year. In addition to having marquee speakers such as President Bill Clinton and Dr. Fareed Zakaria, we had strategy sessions, product forums and user groups. We also hosted a 70,000 square-foot solution center showcasing more than 100 of our leading technology solutions geared at driving a broad range of value for our clients. The feedback on the event has been outstanding.","Our third priority is to deliver meaningful innovation that helps drive differentiation and enhance success for our clients. We announced in February that we will combine the Popmoney and ZashPay P2P payments product and networks and market the enhanced service as Popmoney. The integration will merge the best features of both solutions into a common branded interface, provide best-in-class risk management and process payments using the same secure and scalable Fiserv technologies that are currently used to move billions of payments.","The combined network, which includes some of the largest financial institutions in the U.S., has nearly 1,500 enrolled institutions, with combined initial reach of more than 35 million existing online and mobile banking consumer relationships. The reach of the Popmoney network, combined with advanced capabilities such as request money, multiple funding and receipt options and both online and mobile functionality, have us very well-positioned to host the largest financial institution-centric P2P network in the country. Lastly, we will also integrate Popmoney into our CheckFree RXP payment suite, which is in use at about 3,600 financial institutions. We expect the migration to be complete by midyear.","At our client conference last week, we conducted multiple live demonstrations of realtime Popmoney transactions via our ACCEL\/Exchange PIN debit network. These interbank transactions posted directly to and from live bank accounts, and could be viewed in their respective accounts through Online Banking within a matter of only seconds. We expect to begin offering realtime-enabled transactions within the Popmoney network late in 2012.","With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom, who will provide more detail on our financial results.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, our strong start to the year for revenue and earnings growth was ahead of our planned results for the quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 5% to $1.03 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% for the second consecutive quarter, accelerating from 3% in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings per share increased a very strong 18% to $1.20 in the quarter.","Adjusted operating income grew 6% in the quarter to $296 million and adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 28.7% compared with the first quarter of 2011. Scale, which underlies many of our businesses, and the continued success of our operational effectiveness initiatives, provides us an opportunity to expand margin even as we build out our new solutions.","Now onto the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 6% to $545 million. Adjusted internal revenue growth for the quarter was 3%, which is up sequentially from 2% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth was driven primarily by strength in card services, output solutions and digital channels. As expected, the Wachovia bill payment de-conversion and the Durbin effect on our Biller business had a negative impact on segment revenue growth in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Wachovia de-conversion, bill payment transactions grew 4% in the quarter.","The loss of 2 remit-only clients and a decline in volume from a core competitor that formerly resold CheckFree RXP negatively impacted bill pay transaction growth by about 300 basis points in the period. Our debit business continued its strong performance, as transactions increased 19% in the quarter.","We added 59 new debit clients in the quarter and also expanded the footprint of our ACCEL\/Exchange network by winning several larger network deals related to the new Durbin requirements. Expanding the size of our realtime network is important, both for adding growth in the short term and increasing in the number of endpoints encompass within our longer-term network strategy.","As seen on Page 7 of the supplemental materials, we will now provide P2P transaction growth each quarter. For the quarter, P2P transactions, including Popmoney and ZashPay, increased by 126% compared to the prior year period. Although P2P transactions and the related revenue are still low, tenured clients are seeing more usage, and our sales and implementation pipelines continue to grow. P2P was a hot topic in our client conference last week, which heated up even more after the realtime demos.","Operating income for the Payments segment increased 3% to $161 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 29.5%, down 80 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. This was due primarily to increased investments in Online Banking, mobile, the expected margin dilution of the CashEdge acquisition and the Wachovia bill payment de-conversion.","Growth accelerated in the Financial segment as first quarter revenue increased 4% to $501 million over the prior-year period. Adjusted internal revenue growth was also 4%. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven primarily by recurring revenue in our Account Processing and Lending businesses, along with an increase in termination fees. As anticipated, we also saw slowing of the rate of revenue decline in item processing versus the prior year. Financial segment operating income in the quarter increased 9% to $151 million. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to 30.2% compared with the prior year.","Our adjusted effective tax rate was in line with expectations at 34.5% in the quarter compared with 36.3% in the first quarter of 2011. This resulted in a favorable impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter of roughly $0.03 compared to last year. We are making good progress on sustainably reducing our tax rate and continue to believe our effective tax rate will be approximately 36% for the full year.","Free cash flow was $183 million in the quarter, a decrease of $61 million from the prior year, which was our strongest quarter for free cash flow in the last 4 years. Although the net change in working capital was positive in the current quarter, it was far less so than the $77 million positive working capital impact in the prior year comparable quarter. Most of the decrease in the quarter can be attributed to a $32 million increase in cash tax payments and $21 million of increase incentive and profit-sharing payments paid in 2012 for 2011 accruals. As Jeff mentioned up front, we remain on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance for the year.","Old debt at March 31 was $3.4 billion, or 2.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA. As I mentioned in our last call, we plan to refinance our $1.1 billion term loan, which matures this November. Given the expected terms of the refinance, we anticipate that our next mandatory debt repayment would be $300 million in October of 2015. We repurchased 3.7 million shares of stock in the quarter for $245 million. At quarter-end, there were approximately 11 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Tom. Following the strongest sales quarter and year in the company's history, sales in the first quarter of 2012 were expectedly slow, attaining 58% of straight-line quota. As part of our growth focus, sales quota for the year was increased by about 20% over the '11 numbers, which is reflected in the current results. However, our qualified pipeline at the end of the quarter was quite strong, increasing 29% over the same period last year. We expect our momentum to build throughout the year and lead to another strong performance for our world-class sales force.","We also increased our year-over-year integrated sales target by almost 30% to $200 million even. Integrated sales followed the trend of new sales of $32 million in the quarter or 16% of target. Once again, Payments and channel solutions led our results in the quarter. Our operational effectiveness initiatives yield a strong $13 million of savings in the quarter, representing about 1\/3 of our annual target.","Before I comment on guidance, let me update you briefly on the environment. As expected, regulatory actions continue to abate in 2012. Through April 27, there have been 27 regulatory actions, 44% reduction from the 48 actions during the same period last year. Total assets have impacted institutions to date are down 63% to $7 billion. While narrow spreads, weak loan demand and sluggish economic growth are conspiring to prolong the tough environment for financial institutions, we believe the current market is more stable than we have seen over the last year. However, we do expect some volatility throughout the year with the net of a slow continuing recovery this year.","Financial institutions remain focused on growing revenue, increasing efficiency, expanding customer relationships and exploring ways to build their business through channel preference and data advantages. Lastly, holistic money movement across all customer types is getting significant attention, which given our product set, should spur additional growth.","As I said up front, we are solidly on track to achieve our full year financial guidance. Even with our above-planned performance in the quarter, we continue to expect much stronger results in the second half of 2012. At this point in the year, we believe that any perceived over performance for the quarter should be considered as de-risking our full year results. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth 3% to 4.5% for the year.","We expect adjusted earnings per share for the year of $5.04 to $5.20, a range of 10% to 14% compared to the $4.58 we earned in 2011. We continue to expect 2012 adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points, free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and free cash flow per share of at least $5.70. We're pleased with our start to the year. We are seeing growth opportunities in the market, our industry-leading solutions are in demand and we are layering on high-quality revenue that should recur for years to come. This doesn't just happen. It's the cumulative effort of our 20,000 associates around the world who prove daily the commitment and hard work do indeed translate to superior results for our clients.","With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to start with the Bill payment business because I think you're probably the third company in the last couple of days that has reported a pretty good trend on the Bill payment side. Can you guys just characterize what might be happening on the Bill payment business, what's driving consumers back to Bill payment? Has something changed in the proposition that seems to have sort of spurred more Bill payment-related activities?","Jeffery Yabuki","Well, I think one of the things that's going on within financial institutions is for years, the CheckFree folks and subsequent to our acquisition, we have been touting the retention kind of adaptive relationship benefits of bill pay. And we have seen several larger institutions putting real muscle behind that to try to gain larger shares of wallet. So I think that's one thing. And that's a continuation of trends that we had seen at Bank of America. I think Bank of America really built their business in understanding that, and that's one of the reasons why they've grown so large over the years. The second thing that frankly, we're beginning to see, but it's early, is we -- the growth in this -- in the Bill payment business has -- goes in spurts and now that we're seeing mobile takeoff, we're seeing both people use -- people who were bill pay users begin to use mobile to supplement their online behavior, but more importantly, as mobile is growing in its reach, we see new consumers coming on. We're seeing very, very strong performance in bill pay in the mobile banking channel. In fact, what we can see right now is by far, Bill payment is the technology that is getting the highest amount of utilization in the mobile space. And because we have those 2 solutions together, we think that there's a bit of an embedded advantage. Third, which I think it's premature, so I'm starting to talk a little bit more about the future, Julio, but we do believe that bill payment, especially with the addition of P2P, will begin to rise faster as people get more and more used to paying their bills online. And even today, of the $20 billion or so bills that are in the U.S., there's less than $2 billion paid electronically through bank aggregators. And even if you add direct payment at website, you still have probably 70% -- 60% to 70% of the bills still being made or payments being made using paper. So there's still a long runway there.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just on the acquired revenue contribution from CashEdge, just relative to the estimates that we had, it looks like that one came in or acquired revenue contribution came in a little bit lower than expected. Do you have guys have any color on CashEdge revenue contribution in the quarter for just the way to think about how that's supposed to or how that should ramp for the rest of this year.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, we anticipate, Julio, that, that business is going to ramp rapidly as we go through the years. There's a lot of new clients there, and clearly, on the adoption side also as that subscription revenue base continues to grow. So we knew it was going to continue to have some pretty high growth rates on a quarter-on-quarter basis. So it's right within our -- where our expectations thought it would be at this time.","Thomas J. Hirsch","The only other thing I would say, Julio, is there was a little bit of a slowdown in the market as the market was waiting for us to make a more public decision on which of the networks we were going to move forward with. And so now that, that has now been done, and we've seen the pipeline kind of build up and people start to take action again, again, as we would have expected. So we feel very good about where CashEdge is, both in their core businesses as well as in P2P. We also are getting very good movement in the small business pop solution, which is really business-to-business or consumer-to-business P2P as well as on the aggregation front.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. At the Analyst Day, I think you guys have suggested that, that would be about $80 million in revenue for 2012. Is that number, you guys are still comfortable with?","Thomas J. Hirsch","In that range, yes.","Operator","Brett Huff, Stephens.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I wanted to dig in a little bit on SG&A. At least versus our model, it was a little higher than we expected. Was there anything going on there? Were there some payments to sales force because we had a good sales quarter? Anything like that, that we should pay attention to?","Jeffery Yabuki","No, I don't think there was anything unusual there. I think some of the SG&A associated with the acquisition of CashEdge was a little bit higher maybe than our normal businesses. But outside of that, there really wasn't anything too unusual in there from that standpoint.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And then second question is, you guys have talked about the investments that you've made or continue to make in the sort of top 4 or 5 technology initiatives you have. Is that spending still continuing at about the same level? Is it accelerating or decelerating? And can you give us an update on the return on that and are you starting to see early positive signs or are we still too far out on some of those items?","Jeffery Yabuki","I would say that the spend is still accelerating as in line with what we would have expected for where we were in the year. You'll recall that when we laid that out last year, we expected that we would see a -- start to see a decline in that spend but also see the benefit of the revenue ramp. So one of the reasons why we believe, with a fair amount of conviction, that the second half of the year is going to be better than the first half of the year. So we are tracking in a manner that's consistent with the way that we laid that out. From a demand perspective, I would say that we are seeing the demand look, again, about what we thought it would be across each of the different solutions. I would say that demand in the CashEdge suite, and specifically on the small business product, has probably been a little bit better than we thought. And again, maybe there's a small offset because we had a little bit of a slowdown in the sales pipe. But our implementation, as Tom mentioned, our implementation pipeline is strong and our sales pipeline is strong. So on balance, that -- I feel good about where we are and how we're tracking against the plan that we laid out last October.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I just want to make sure I understood you right. The spending is still accelerating as you expected. You mentioned the back half. Do you think that, that back half benefit will be because the spending is starting to taper and\/or because you'll start to see some revenue from that or -- I just want to make sure I got that last.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, it will be flat -- it will be flattening out, tapering relative so that the slow book to spend will change -- so we'll be spending but we won't be increasing it at the rate we had been increasing it, and then the revenue will be coming on. And then as we get towards the end of the year, right, we actually should begin to see that taper.","Operator","Glenn Greene, Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess the first question, maybe for Jeff, just want to go back to the sales quota attainment and kind of how to think about that. Obviously, the fourth quarter was really strong but I would have assumed you would have sort of thought through that in terms of the timing of the sales activity for the year going in the first quarter. So I'm just kind of highlighting that. And your thinking about that 58% quota attainment relative to the goal, how should we think about that or get comfortable with that?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. It's actually pretty simple. Glenn, we don't bother to pace our quota. We merely take a straight-line quota throughout the year. And so the very nature of the strength of our fourth quarter -- so we don't say, well, the first quarter is going to be much lower, the fourth quarter is going to be much higher, even though we know that's going to happen. And because we think it -- there's a little bit too much subjectivity in there, and so we just take a straight-line basis that's consistent with what we have always done. And then, as we said, we also increased our quota significantly on a year-to-year basis. So those 2 items combined are leaving us where we are for the first quarter. We don't have concern about that given how strong the fourth quarter was. That tends to drain your pipeline, but we also talked about the fact that our pipeline was up, I want to say, 29% on a year-over-year basis. So that actually gives us a lot of optimism for the sales results that we'll see during 2012.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. But I know you've been disclosing this the last few quarters, with maybe on a year-to-date basis. But any way to sort of frame like the sales growth, forgetting relative to the quota, but just the absolute sales growth?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, on an absolute basis, we would actually -- our sales results would be down quarter-to-quarter. Which again, we're not surprised about just given the pure strength of the results in Q4 and the size of the pipeline gain at the end of Q1. So had we paced it out, we would have paced it out to look very close to how it looks right now.","Thomas J. Hirsch","And we have a number of deals out there, Glenn, as you know, that can move from quarter-to-quarter just depending on when those deal is signed. So as Jeff indicated, our pipeline from a standpoint of where it is year-over-year, we're in good shape there.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And maybe on -- back to the -- on a different topic, Durbin and the ACCEL wins, I think you highlighted 7 wins? Was that sort of a net 7 wins and maybe just a little bit of background on kind of what's going on in the market and what are you seeing?","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. I think we used -- the term of art that we used on that was several. Just to not put a definitive number out there because we're still -- actually one of the reasons why our pipeline is strong is we actually have a fair amount of activity still out there even though we've come and past April 1, there's still a fair amount of activity in the market. We actually feel really good about the number of institutions that we ended up signing on that front. And the term of art around several was really around institutions larger than $10 billion, so the nonexempt institutions that are not our debit processing clients. So clients for which we are not doing their debit work today have then agreed to bring us in as their -- either on a second brand or a primary brand. So we've made some good progress. The other reason why we're being a little bit broader on this is, is there are a lot of variables out there right now. It depends on how much -- if we're a second network, how much volume comes over on the second network. What ends up with the merchants in terms of how they decide to route transactions. Obviously, some of the very large merchants are taking more control on their routing. But one of the underlying benefits that we're picking up in here is that as we mentioned around the realtime, one of the strategies that we laid out, Glenn, at our Investor Day back in October, was the ability to use ACCEL exchange, use that PIN debit network to do realtime. And we're really excited about the fact that we were able to live demo the interbank transactions, right? So 2 separate banks, transactions moving in a matter of seconds. And so the more people we have in our primary PIN debit network, of course, we'll likely go out and set up relationships with the other networks. But within our PIN debit network, we're going to have more control. And we literally picked up millions of new debit relationships through these several clients. So we feel like we've not just set ourselves up for some more growth this year, but continue to build that network potential because it's not just P2P that has realtime opportunity, there are other payment mechanisms, other ways to expedite payments that we're working on that are quite exciting. And we'll deliver premium pricing to the financial institutions and then of course, some incremental benefit to us.","Operator","Dave Koning, Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And so, I guess, first of all, we've talked about this before that the payments margin has been coming down just a bit over the last couple of years. And this was the first quarter it was below 30% in about 4 years. And I know a lot of that is just the investments for growth long term and that makes a lot of sense. Is some of that driven by the Durbin piece? I wouldn't imagine there'd be much there, but maybe just some of the same factors that contributed to the revenue headwinds do?","Jeffery Yabuki","No, I think, Dave, the biggest thing we have there is, as we talked about a little bit, is the investments because as you know, we have our mobile in there, we have our Online Banking channel in there, we have P2P in that particular segment. And the other piece of that is the Wachovia business, as you know, has been de-converted. And so that's impacting our year-over-year comparisons there also from a margin standpoint. But those are really the bigger drivers that we have from that standpoint.","Thomas J. Hirsch","And Dave, the other thing that's in there right now is there is measurable dilution from CashEdge in that segment. So that's a structural and we have to build back into that margin over time.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, okay, that makes a lot of sense. And I guess the thing along that same topic, is it foreseeable that you talked about a 300 basis point headwind in Q1, and as we go towards the back half of the year, that probably dissipates and maybe somewhere around that time you resigned BofA. Is it possible that the BofA almost isn't noticeable in the numbers if the timing would work out right?","Jeffery Yabuki","What we said, as you know, Dave, overall, from a company standpoint, we feel we are going to have a stronger second half. That's the way the year is laying out. That's what we've said back in early February and that's what we're saying today. So clearly, our overall results are going to be more positive in the second half of the year than the first half. And there's a number of moving parts there. But clearly, we're confident that the second half is going to be better than the first half.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just one little housekeeping. What was the term fee in Q1?","Jeffery Yabuki","Excuse me, Dave, I'm sorry.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. The term fees, what was the revenue from that in Q1?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, it was up about $8 million on a year-over-year basis to about $12 million. We had a couple of million in the Payments segment and then the rest of that was in the Financial segment.","Operator","The next question is from John Kraft at D.A. Davidson.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I was hoping to follow up on Glenn's question about your ACCEL debit network. At the Analyst Day, you specifically we're talking about gaining share when the routing exclusivity rules kicked in. And then in your prepared remarks, you did say there was a bunch of wins. So it sounds like that's happening. And then Jeff, you suggested that there were lots of variables. But I'm specifically interested in pricing. I've heard increasingly about price reductions by some of the other alternative networks in response to VISA's new pricing structure.","Jeffery Yabuki","So John, are you asking how these got priced relative to our expectations?","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Well, I just am curious whether the pricing is being used to offset some of these new Visa pricing initiatives. If that's something that's heading south?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, I know. I hear what you're saying. Not at this point. I mean, most of these transactions have been in negotiation for a while. As you know, this is not necessarily new news. And I think people are, to some extent, sitting back and trying to get a handle on exactly what Visa is doing on their overall pricing strategy. But the differentiation that we bring within our network is the fact that we can -- we believe strongly, and our clients tend to believe as well, that we're going to be able to do more with the network. And so to them, that the opportunity is to create more revenue using the network for more than just PIN debit.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","The realtime stuff?","Jeffery Yabuki","Right.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And then, if I could sneak in another one here, just another clarification. The P2P transactions, those are not included in your bill pay transactions overall, correct?","Jeffery Yabuki","No, they're not. And I think on Page, I want to say, 7, doing that from memory, 7, in the materials, you can see that we -- we're now showing the transaction growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I guess what I'm wondering is, I would assume at least that some of those P2P transactions would have been standard bill pay kind of via your pay anyone feature. I'm wondering if that's some of the pressure, that was just simply cannibalization or is it just too small now to make a dent?","Jeffery Yabuki","Well, it's important. We are not -- for instance, we are not going in to bill pay and trying to make a determination on what could be a P2P payment within bill pay. I mean, these are only payments that are being made within ZashPay and within Popmoney. Nothing else, completely separate from bill pay.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","But presumably those payments, those transactions might have been in -- done over your bill pay networks.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. No, I hear what you're saying. And I think that's -- I think it is impossible over the longer haul to believe that there won't be some movement, right, between those channels. My -- based on what I can see in the transactions, and this is obviously, early and hypothetical, that the people who are using P2P tend to be different than the people that are using bill pay. And today, the way the services are presented, they would not really allow someone to easily say, \"Well, I would have paid my bill here in bill pay. Now I'm going to do it via P2P.\" I think over a number of years, you could begin to see that happen. But the way that the data looks right now, I would say that is not the case.","Operator","David Togut, Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Could you update us on the expected timing and financial impact of the Bank of America contract renewal with CheckFree?","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. So we continue to work very closely with BofA. We have developed a very strong and solid strategic relationship with them. Obviously, they're a very important client to us. You may recall that their agreement expires in March of '13. And we continue to work with them on how that deal will hopefully be renewed.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And what are your expectations at this point with respect to potential timing and financial impact on Fiserv?","Jeffery Yabuki","Well, we had talked about this in the fourth quarter call. We laid out guidance that we believe captures any potential early discount that we may provide. And that we are optimistic that we'll be able to extend that deal. Obviously, the contract expires in March of '13. And so those are the data points that I would provide.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just a question on Acumen. You've had very strong signings of the last 12, 18 months. When should we start to see some of these bookings flow into revenue?","Jeffery Yabuki","I think we're starting now, David. We'll be clearly getting some of those as we go in this year. These are very complex conversions with a lot of extended content. And so those conversions take a while to complete. But we've signed a number of accounts, so we'll see some impact, and I would anticipate it's going to continue to ramp this year. But as we get to the end of the year, we're going to have a very good ramp up as we head into 2013.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a final housekeeping question. What was your end-of-period share count for Q1?","Jeffery Yabuki","Our shares outstanding were roughly 137.3 million.","Operator","Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just license sales in the quarter, how did that come in versus planned? I'm sorry if I missed that.","Jeffery Yabuki","They were just down slightly from the prior year just given our strong Q4, but pretty well in line. But they were down substantially from the fourth quarter just given our strong fourth quarter performance. But actually, held up fairly well compared to the prior year just given that Q4 performance that we have in that particular area.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I know you've commented that you were above internal plan. Caught a lot of that detail. But how much of it, do you think, is cyclical versus Fiserv-specific? I'm just trying to get a sense of what's happening on the ground versus how much you guys are driving directly, if you follow my question.","Jeffery Yabuki","Can you give a little bit more clarity?","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, Jeff, sorry. Just some of the above planned performance that you were talking about in some of those subsectors, how much of that is cyclical, meaning just better, whatever -- same store performance or better IT spending than expected versus Fiserv-specific with some of the sales efforts that you guys have put out. Obviously, the Popmoney and the halo effect of that. Just trying to get a sense of how much of this is macro versus something you guys drove.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. I mean, I think it is a little of both. I mean, I think the sales, the demand and the growth, right, all these big macro areas that we've been talking about and are focused on. The thing that we want -- we don't want -- we think it's way too early to let anything or anyone get ahead of us. And we think, right now, the guidance that we laid out at the beginning of the year is the right guidance. And we think that the second half is going to be stronger than the first half, and we just think it's prudent just to, as we said, to take any of the over performance in the quarter and just use it to de-risk the balance of the year. We'll see what we are at the end of the second quarter. I think I'll give -- we'll have much better insights at that point.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. Just last one, from a term fee perspective, should we expect anything of size for the balance of the year?","Jeffery Yabuki","We don't -- I think last year, we had between $25 million and $30 million of term termination fees and they fall, as you know, through the quarter and those can be volatile just depending on where they kind of hit. I would say the second quarter last year, we had a little bit higher termination fees, but there's nothing more significant from that standpoint versus our regular termination fee that we get just as part of the business.","Operator","Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess my question is on the pipeline and obviously, that's built up nicely during the quarter. But are you in a situation here, where after the strong bookings we saw for a few quarters, if you have to go to a period of rebuilding of the pipeline before you start seeing good bookings again? In other words, that quota attainment, is that going to be anywhere close to 100% or better until the end of the year or should we expect a recovery soon?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, that's a good question. It is clearly, clearly the strength of the fourth quarter depleted the highly, highly qualified pipeline. And so it leaves you with a weaker position in the beginning of the year. Now that combined with the fact that we continue to notch up expectations, that's a really important point in raising quota around 20% year-over-year, and that's a big deal. So from that standpoint, I would say, we certainly had those 2 issues working against us. But I would also say that, as Tom, I think, referenced earlier in Q&A, it doesn't take much, right? If a good-sized deal ends up slipping from March 30 to April 30, things can move a lot. I mean, we feel very good about our pipeline and actually our further weighted pipeline is even stronger, right, on a year-over-year basis. So we think we will make some important progress between now and the next time we announce results. The only caveat that I would give you is in the 6.5 years or so that I've been here, I have, at times, heard that deals will get done and they end up slipping a bit, they end up getting done almost every single time, but sometimes they slipped. So I don't think this a kind of thing where you're going to have to wait until the fourth quarter for us to get on track.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's good to know. I guess only one other question. There was about, $0.06 of severance in the quarter and that continues to be sort of a steady impact, I think. Is that going to be with us for the foreseeable future, a steady level of just being on cutting costs or is that at some point going to...","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. I think, what I would say, Ashwin, is that we continued to -- we have a number of efficiency objectives. As you know, we have our operational effectiveness objectives as a company. We have certain businesses that you're aware of that are also in decline. And so we have to take the appropriate actions to adjust our cost structure as appropriate in those particular areas and as to redeploy these resources then into other areas of growth that we've talked about, whether that be mobile or Acumen or Online Banking, et cetera. So we have one of these charges in the first quarter of last year. We are going to have them from time to time, not necessarily from a size standpoint every year or every first quarter. But we will continually, over the next 3 to 5 years, continue to adjust our cost structure as appropriate going forward.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, and I would add to that, that it is declining and we have every reason to believe it will decline. And the things that we are doing around our second Phase $250 million operational effectiveness program, do have impacts that, we believe, makes sense to be excluded from operations given the fact that it's really nonoperational. And you can also see that in this quarter, we had $13 million of saves to -- due to the operational effectiveness program. That's $9 million higher than it was last year in the same quarter. So we are seeing those benefits getting added in to our P&L. And I think at the time, I don't think I know at the time that we explained the program, we did indicate that there would be onetime costs for the 5-year period that would link to the kinds of actions that we're taking there.","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sales growth, I guess, was down and that makes sense. I mean, seasonally, you're not going to be able to match the fourth quarter. But was it down year-over-year?","Jeffery Yabuki","It was down on a year-over-year basis. And it was down on a year-over-year basis, frankly, because of just the phenomenal strength in Q4. But the good news was is that the qualified pipeline grew very fast and we went from really draining the pipeline significantly to having our qualified pipeline be up nearly 30% on -- in a matter of 3 months versus where it was in the prior year. So even with the 20% increase in our quota expectations for the year, we feel very good that we will end up being at or above our quota target for the year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And when you guys say you're ahead of plan, are you including the sales numbers in that comment?","Jeffery Yabuki","That's really the financial results themselves.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just when you say the second half will be stronger than the first, are you alluding to internal and EPS, or what exactly are you alluding to there?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, absolute performance, from that standpoint, both from a revenue and earnings standpoint. So revenues themselves on an absolute basis will be higher and earnings on an absolute basis will be higher.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just last question for me, the payments in the Financial segment, obviously, Payments was down a little and Financial was up quite a bit. Kind of similar, somewhat similar to what it was last quarter. What is the outlook for those 2 segments? Should we assume kind of similar trends going forward? I don't know if you can help me with that, Tom.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, what do you mean by payments? What are you referring to? Are you referring to the revenue and operating income there, Brian or...","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, just the Payments segment, I think, was down 80 basis points, Financial was up quite a bit, 130 basis points.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Oh, from a margin standpoint, yes.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, from a margin standpoint. And then going forward, should that -- should we see a similar balance or there's a reverse or...","Thomas J. Hirsch","I think there's always ins and outs but I would say that, clearly, we're making more investments right now in the Payments segment and the drop through rate isn't where we would like it from a long-term standpoint. And so I think over the long haul, you would anticipate that they'll be some upside from things like mobile and Online Banking, et cetera, from a margin standpoint.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, Brian, there are really 3 core items that are driving down the compare where we are in Q1 and; we'll also see it in Q2. And that is we've got Wachovia -- Wachovia de-conversion, that will be gone at the end of the second quarter. So that should start -- you'll have an apples-to-apples basis there. And then we've got the investments, the majority of the investments that we're making in the company, really besides Acumen sit in the Payments segment. So towards the end of the year, you'll see that start to remediate. And then the third item is really the dilution -- like the margin dilution related to the CashEdge acquisition. So those are all impacting the Payments segment at the same time. So we definitely believe, over time, that's going to reverse back. There's no question.","Operator","Greg Smith, Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Any different thinking around paying a dividend in light of how the market is treating dividend payers these days?","Jeffery Yabuki","No. I mean, we -- we've -- at least as we sit here on May 1, we look at this on a pretty regular basis. And frankly, we've looked at it a lot more recently because of all the dialogue that's in the market. From our standpoint, we have been extremely disciplined at returning cash to shareholders via share repurchase. Our total return metrics are probably in the top handful of companies in terms of returning free cash flow, either through the combination of share repurchase and\/or dividends. At least in the last 6 years, we've been very, very consistent on that. And I think we bought back about $245 million in the first quarter alone. So we feel good about that. The other issue that, frankly, is probably beyond my pay grade is, there's a lot of tax consternation right now. And we think it's prudent to see how the tax laws layout, and we'll continue to incorporate that into our evaluation. But, Greg, I assure you that we will continue to evaluate it as we have. And at some point, we may come to a different conclusion. But for now, we're quite comfortable with how we return the shareholders.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No complaints with the buyback in the quarter. Just do you, off the top of your head, happen to know sort of the adoption metrics for Online Banking, traditional Online Banking versus online, sort of both as a subset of all banking users? Just trying to get an idea of how rapidly mobile is evolving. I mean, mobile and then online and how it's evolving relative to how online evolved.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, I'll give it a shot, and it will be direct -- at least it will be directionally correct. So today, I think the statistic is something like 85% or 90% of consumers in the U.S. have access to the Internet. They don't necessarily have it, but they may have it either at home, or work, or both. From an Online Banking perspective, the number is somewhere in the area of 65% to 70%, all of the online -- I'm sorry, all of the people who have bank accounts have Online Banking access. And you may remember we showed this at our Investor Day, we have about 55 million Online Banking users today. So that's how that piece of the universe stratifies. On the mobile banking side, it's very, very early, right? I would be surprised if -- I don't actually have a number, but I would guess it's in the 20-ish million range at the very most. And we have -- I think, we gave a statistic at a conference recently, where we had about, I want to say, 3.5 million or so users live on our mobile platform. And we believe that there is an inherent advantage for our clients to select our mobile -- our Online Banking clients to select mobile because they're access -- they go access into the system the same way. It was 3.7 million mobile users. So that's kind of how that would build up.","Thomas J. Hirsch","I think, Greg, you can go back to, I thought, our Investor Day. Erich Litch put up in his presentation, I believe, some stats around that. The adoption of Online Banking and how we think mobile is going to go over that period of time also.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then just lastly, any new international opportunities emerge in the quarter or subsequent?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. I mean, we certainly -- certainly, we are actually pursuing several large international transactions. Recently, we closed a good-sized mobile deal in Europe. We're working on several mobile deals in Europe and actually a number of mobile deals around the world. That's a pretty interesting space for us. Some Online Banking and actually some pretty good core deals in Europe. So there's -- there are good opportunities out there right now. Those international deals tend to be -- tend to have very long sales cycles, but we continue to pursue them.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And I just have to ask. The mobile deals, that's even though you're potentially not the core processor?","Jeffery Yabuki","Oh, yes. The mobile deal that we won, I don't think we've announced -- I don't think we have asked for permission to use the name, but it's a very large European bank. A good-sized European bank, let me say that, where we are not the core provider at all.","Operator","Kartik Mehta, Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","You've talked a lot about the Durbin and some of the opportunities you've had. If you look back today compared to when all these passed and all the noise started happening about it, do you think -- has the benefit, what you anticipated less or more? Considering where we are today?","Jeffery Yabuki","Well, from my perspective, I really -- I thought we would get a couple of deals. I would actually say it's been slightly better than I thought it would be in terms of the size and magnitude of the institutions. And as it became more clear how competitive that space was going to be, I actually ratcheted my expectations down and we actually did far better against my ratcheted down expectations. And I'm actually quite enthusiastic about what I see going on in the market right now. I think as it's becoming more clear as to what the advantages are in using certain providers, I believe that we will actually end up winning more business throughout the year. So I would say, on balance, it's probably slightly better than I thought. And all of it was extra given the trajectory we were on. And then the ability to have a larger underlying network, right through ACCEL\/Exchange to do other things, actually makes it a huge plus.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then, Jeff, you've said that spending seems to be accelerating. I know this is a difficult question, but to the extent you could give some color on it, where do you think we are from a spending point today financial institutions versus what we were at its peak whenever that was in your mind?","Jeffery Yabuki","I would say somewhere between 1\/3 and 1\/2 of where we were. If you call the peak the beginning of '07, okay, if that's kind of your peak period, I would say FI spend in that time was probably 5%, 6%. Now I would say that on balance, FI spend is probably half that in the U.S.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And so there's still a lot of room for growth as these banks continue to feel better?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, I think that is absolutely the case. And I think we've tried to make it more clear that we do see bank spending but they are doing a little bit of moving the money from bucket to bucket. Like the general size of the spend is really not expanding very rapidly. And at some point in the future, we would expect spend to get back up to more normal levels. But frankly, that's not going to happen until financial institutions can have an environment where they can make more money. It's pretty tough for FIs to make money right now.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question, Tom. I know you said this, but I apologize that I missed it. You said that term fees and you broke it out to doing Financial and Payments. Could you just repeat those numbers as to how...","Thomas J. Hirsch","Sure. The contract termination fees were $12 million in the first quarter of this year, there are $4 million in the first quarter of last year. So they're up roughly $8 million. A couple of million in the Payments segment and the remainder in the Financial segment.","Jeffery Yabuki","So I think our queue is empty. So thanks, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please follow up with our Investor Relations team. Have a good night.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

With me today are our Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Yabuki; Tom Hirsch, our CFO; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted revenue growth, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, free cash flow per share, revenue and cost synergies, sales pipelines, acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.

These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods.","As a reminder, we will hold our Annual Meeting of Shareholders at 10 a.m. on May 22 at the Milwaukee Art Museum. The meeting will also be broadcast live via our webcast. We hope you will join us.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were in line with our plan, and we're pleased with our start to the year. As I shared in early February, this year is somewhat unique in that we expected a slow revenue start, and then to build sequentially each quarter for the remainder of the year. We're well positioned to achieve our full year guidance.","Adjusted revenue in the quarter grew 6% and internal revenue was flat. Adjusted earnings per share was up 13% to $1.33 and free cash flow in the quarter grew 33% to $1.72 per share. Adjusted operating margin declined 30 basis points in the quarter to 28.4%.","Comparatively, last year's first quarter, which included significant termination fees, was our highest growth quarter of the year. We expect revenue to build each quarter as we onboard some of our larger sales transactions, particularly in the bill payment area. In this regard, our largest of the new bill payment clients, TD Bank, went live on CheckFree RXP at the end of the first quarter.","Sales were also up to a strong start, up 25% year-over-year. These results exclude the impact of Open Solutions, which will be included in the sales comparison next year.","It's been just 3.5 months since we acquired Open Solutions, and with each day, we gain confidence about the opportunities in the business. Open clients feel good about the strength and stability of their new technology partner, and have a strong desire to understand how they can benefit from our solutions.","In February, we established 3 key enterprise priorities to help you gauge our progress. This year's priorities are: one, to continue to build high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to extend market momentum into deeper client relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration to enhance results for our clients with an important focus on Open Solutions.","Adjusted internal revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 3 percentage points in the quarter due primarily to lower termination and license fees, along with known drags such as the impact of the Bank of America renewal and the large account processing core deconversion. We expect the onboarding of new business, combined with current sales success, to drive substantial growth this year.","We expect the benefits of the Open acquisition to ramp throughout 2013, which also contributes to positive momentum in the second half of the year. And for those keeping score, we anticipate our Payments segment adjusted internal revenue growth will be within our long-term outlook of 4% to 8% for the remainder of the year.","Our second priority is to turn market momentum into deeper client relationships with the larger share of our strategic solutions. We recently held 2 of our larger client conferences, including Open Solutions, which tallied approximately 4,000 client and prospect attendees. This provided a record number of Open clients with a  firsthand opportunity to explore and evaluate Fiserv's suite of highly rated solutions. The feedback and sales activity from these events has been outstanding.","Sales of our market-leading Payments and Channel Solutions were solid in the quarter. We more than tripled the number of Mobiliti ASP users from the year-ago quarter, eclipsing the 1 million subscriber mark. We also signed 90 new institutions for a total of nearly 1,500 clients to date on our Mobiliti solution.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration for our clients with an important focus on Open Solutions. We continue to see the intersection of digital experience in Payments to me -- to be among the most innovative opportunities confronting us today. We continue to see great demand for Popmoney, signing 89 new institutions in the quarter, bringing the total to over 1,900 network member institutions.","Transactions, while still scaling, grew 68% over the last year's quarter. There's also strong interest in our SpotPay solution, which allows issuers to enable small merchants to accept credit and debit cards, driving value for their customer and fee revenue for the client.","We worked with Bank of the West in the quarter to launch Quick Balance, a first of its kind innovation among major U.S. banks, which enables the customer, if they choose, to check their account balance on a digital device without logging into the app.","We were pleased to announce at our client conference that PNC Bank intends to be the first major financial institution in the U.S. to offer Popmoney Instant Payments. The service, which enables payments to be credited to a recipient's account within seconds, is available to financial institutions that offer Popmoney and also our members of ACCEL or the STAR network, which we also added in the quarter. Now thousands and thousands of financial institutions with tens of millions of consumers will have the possibility of realtime payments at their fingertips.","We remain keenly focused on providing differentiated offerings that provide rich user experiences for our clients and their customers.","Finally, as I mentioned, we have good momentum with the Open Solutions integration, including sales of DNA. In the quarter, we signed 5 new DNA account processing clients, both banks and credit unions, and more sales than any quarter since 2011. We like the STAR and are encouraged by the strength and quality of the sales pipeline.","We're making good progress in the Acumen transition and believe DNA, enhanced by unique Acumen capabilities, creates powerful realtime alternatives for text-savvy institutions in the U.S.","Our Open synergy plans are being executed well. Interest is strong from Open clients in areas such as bill payment, debit, Online Banking and mobile. While not yet final, our integration teams have identified expense and revenue synergy opportunities greater than our original run rate estimates of $50 million and $75 million, respectively. We feel great about that progress.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail in the quarter.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the results, let me clarify a couple of items which have an impact on the comparability of our results in the quarter. First, the Open Solutions results are for a partial quarter and include only the 2.5 months since the January '14 close. Second, we disposed of a small non-strategic business, Club Solutions, which is slightly dilutive to adjusted EPS, about $0.04 per share in 2013.","Our prior financial results have been adjusted for the divestiture and are included in the supplemental materials. We also disposed of a very small product line during the quarter, which has not been restated in our financial results.","As Jeff mentioned, our start to the year was consistent with our internal plan. Adjusted revenue increased 6% to $1.1 billion and adjusted internal revenue was flat. Adjusted earnings per share increased a solid 13% in the quarter to $1.33. Adjusted operating income grew 5% to $308 million and adjusted income grew 8%.","Adjusted operating margin declined 30 basis points to 28.4% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Our internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately 3 percentage points due to several factors, including lower termination fee and license revenue as compared to the strong first quarter last year. And the headwinds we identified coming into 2013.","Given the noise in the quarter, let me dissect the headline results to provide a better understanding of the solid underlying trends we are seeing. We don't believe the 30-basis-point decline in operating margin tells the story of the quarter.","Operating margin was negatively impacted by over 100 basis points due to the Open acquisition and higher expenses in the Corporate segment. Most of our businesses performed well and, in fact, the Payments segment margin expanded by 90 basis points in the quarter.","Including Open, processing and services revenue was up nearly 8% in the quarter, which positively contributed to further recurring revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion.","Now let me provide a bit more color on the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment, which was all internal, increased 2% to $543 million. Revenue in the quarter was driven by solid performance in debit, Biller Solutions and our Mobiliti businesses, partially offset by the Bank of America renewal pricing and lower license fee revenue in our risk businesses. We anticipate strong revenue acceleration in the segment for the remainder of the year.","Adjusted operating income for the segment increased 5% to $166 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 90 basis points to 30.5% in the quarter. The adjusted margin in the quarter was positively impacted by the scale benefits of our transaction-based businesses, largely in debit processing and digital channels, offset by the Bank of America pricing impact and lower license fees.","Debit volume in the quarter was up 13%, which reflects our strong market position. Transaction growth is moving in the right direction in bill payments, as volume increased 3% versus both a year ago and sequential quarters. This is a great step forward, reversing the trend and recording our best transaction growth in the last 4 quarters.","We also saw a notable return to growth in e-bill volume, which increased 5% in the quarter, matching the highest growth since 2009.","Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 11% in the quarter to $555 million, driven by 2.5 months of Open Solutions results. Adjusted internal revenue declined by 2%, which includes significantly lower termination fees, reduction in license revenue and the migration of the previously discussed large account processing client, which anniversaries later this year. All told, these items combined for about 4 percentage points of segment decline in the quarter.","Segment operating income increased 9% to $165 million and the operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 29.8% in the quarter. This margin decline included more than 200 basis points of impact related to the items I just mentioned and Open Solutions.","Positive operating margin benefits in the segment came from Operational Effectiveness savings and strong performance in item processing. The segment will see measurable benefits from Open transaction synergies during the second half of this year.","Operating expense in our Corporate and Other segment was up $8 million over the prior year's quarter, primarily due to an unusually low 2012 compare, the timing of expenses and $3 million of incremental legal costs in the quarter. Corporate results negatively impact overall operating margin by 70 basis points in the quarter.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.7%, slightly higher than last year's first quarter rate of 34.5%. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 2013 will be approximately 35%, slightly better than the 35.7% rate in 2012.","Free cash flow in the quarter was exceptional at $232 million, an increase of 28% from the prior-year period. Free cash flow per share was up sharply to $1.72, an increase of 33% over the prior-year period. Free cash flow gains were driven primarily from an 8% increase in adjusted income and positive working capital improvements.","Total debt at March 31 was just over $4 billion or 2.7x trailing adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 800,000 shares of stock in the quarter for approximately $67 million. At quarter end, there were approximately 4.8 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","Consistent with our guidance, we expect to allocate more cash to debt repayment in 2013 than last year. And remain committed to allocating capital in a manner that builds substantial value for our shareholders.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Tom. As I mentioned upfront, sales are off to a strong start even after finishing 2012 with record contract value. Sales for the quarter, excluding Open Solutions, was up 25% over the prior year. Sales quota attainment in the quarter was 87% of straight line performance, which compares favorably to the 58% attainment in last year's first quarter. Our sales pipeline remains very strong with a different mix than last year's results, which was led primarily by significant bill payment wins.","We've set a 2013 Integrated sales target of $210 million, which as you will recall, reflects annualized revenue, and this total includes $8 million related to our Open Solutions clients. During the quarter, we achieved $38 million of Integrated sales.","Our 2013 Operational Effectiveness goal is $60 million, which includes $17 million of anticipated Open Solutions cost synergies. For the quarter, we attained $14 million or 23% of our annual Operational Effectiveness goal. We've calibrated this year's objective to ensure we capitalize on the Open Solutions opportunity quickly and effectively.","Environmentally, regulatory actions continued to abate in 2013. Through the end of March, there were only 9 actions, less than half the number during the same period last year, which is indicative of the general stability in the industry. On balance, institutions appear healthier and somewhat more optimistic. The majority of financial institution conversations are centered on mobile, payments and new ways to make more money, balanced by the unpredictability of the regulatory environment.","Our views on IT spend have not changed and we continue to see a bias to outsource solutions. Digital access, including tablet, smartphones and other devices, has gained a much more significant seat at the table, which is very well aligned with our strategic focus.","As for guidance, our 2013 growth remains on track, including the adjustment for the Club Solutions disposition. We still expect full year adjusted revenue to increase by more than 10% and that adjusted internal revenue will grow 3% to 4%. Importantly, we expect to see sequential gains in revenue growth throughout the year.","We expect adjusted EPS to grow in the range of 15% to 19% or $5.84 to $6.03 per share, which reflects a $0.04 per share impact from the divestiture. And that operating margin will expand between 10 and 50 basis points for the full year. We expect free cash flow per share to increase by at least 18% or greater than $6.55 per share, which has also been adjusted slightly as a result of the divestiture.","We feel great about our start to the year and are well positioned to achieve our full year guidance. The Open Solutions integration is going well, and we see additional opportunities to unlock value beyond what we identified at the time of acquisition.","We expect the combination of sequential quarterly growth and meaningful strategic progress to provide momentum this year and into 2014.","And last but not least, we thank our 21,000 associates around the world who are committed to enabling success for our clients each and everyday.","With that, let's open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","David, can I ask you a question before you ask a question?","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Did you hear me talk about guidance?","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I apologize, because I was actually joining the call late from another call that was occurring at the same time.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Okay. We heard that there was some music being played during the guidance. So what I'd like to do if it's okay, is go back and reread the guidance section and then we'll come back to you on the question, if that's okay?","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","All right. So as for guidance, our 2013 growth remains on track, including the adjustment for the Club Solutions disposition. We still expect full year adjusted revenue to increase by more than 10%, and that adjusted internal revenue will grow 3% to 4%.","Importantly, we expect to see sequential gains in revenue growth throughout the year. We expect adjusted EPS to grow in a range of 15% to 19% or $5.84 to $6.03 per share, which reflects a $0.04 per share impact from the divestiture, and that operating margin will expand between 10 and 50 basis points for the full year.","We expect free cash flow per share to increase by at least 18% or greater than $6.55 per share, which has also been adjusted slightly as a result of the divestiture.","We feel great about our start to the year and are well positioned to achieve our full year guidance. The Open Solutions integration is going well, and we see additional opportunities to unlock value beyond what we identified at the time of the acquisition. We expect the combination of sequential quarterly growth and meaningful strategic progress to provide momentum this year and into 2014.","And last but never least, we thank our 21,000 associates around the world who are committed to enabling success for our clients each and everyday.","All right. So thank you for allowing us to re-go through that. So David, are you still on?","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, I am, Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","All right.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just to start it off -- and again, I apologize if you addressed this in your opening remarks, but staying with the 3% to 4% organic growth outlook for the year despite sort of a flattish start in Q1, what gives you so much conviction that you can get up to that level, particularly after a disappointing fourth quarter as well?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, a great question. Let me go through that. We have 5 or 6 areas that we see that are going to drive our growth for the remainder of the year. The first is really around onboarding our significant bill payment wins, and you can see that start to show up in the transaction volume in both bill payment and in e-bill this quarter. As I mentioned, we had TD that went online towards the end of the first quarter, and we actually have large installs coming in each quarter of the year from wins last year as well as actually a couple from the prior year. So we're quite excited to have those go live. And then, of course, as we announced at the end of the last year, we had Wells. We have Wells going on in the first quarter of '14 but that will continue that momentum forward. The secondary is really continuing strength in payments. We've had, as we've talked about, we've had strong results in debit, so in the card business. We're seeing some acceleration in our CashEdge-oriented products. We talked about Instant Payments and Popmoney. And as I mentioned, we do expect and have a high degree of confidence that our Payments segment growth will average 4% to 8% for the remainder of the year, well within our outlook, our long-term outlook. The next item is really around digital. As I mentioned, we had good success, 90 new mobile sales in the quarter. We still have several hundred institutions and backlog. Growth in ASP subscribers has been higher than we thought it would be and continues to be strong, over 1 million at the end of the quarter. We actually have a couple of large Online Banking customers coming online in the middle of the year. Those are deals that at, least one of them, we've been working on for about 16 months, large hosted deals, so that will come online, and we'll start recognizing revenue from there. And we also have a new ASP tablet offering that will go live in the middle of the year. Next item is really around current sales. We had a great sales start to the year, 25% increase year-over-year. And we expect that, that will actually turn into revenue sooner because it's first quarter sales. And then we've got the headwinds that Tom referenced, and that we identified coming into the year that we knew would work against us. We'll see that start to dissipate late in the year. So for all of those reasons, we have a good degree of confidence. And then lastly, a little bit tangential but important, open Solutions will continue to come online as we move through the year and we expect to see some more license revenue come in there and we also expect to see some revenue synergies come online. So those are the reasons why we're confident. We know that the fourth quarter last year was not where we wanted it to be, but it's really license revenue-based. And that part of that was the compare issue that actually impacted us, both last year in Q4, that Q4 of '11 was so strong that we actually had bleed into Q1 of 2012 and that worked against us. So we do have a high degree of confidence. It's largely around recurring revenue. Our plans this year do not show big ramps in license revenue. So for those reasons, we're actually highly confident in our results for the remainder of the year.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That helped. As a follow-up, what are the largest drivers of the $60 million Operational Effectiveness target, excluding the Open Solutions cost takeout?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think, David, overall -- this is Tom. I think we continue to make progress in our globalization initiatives, as you all know. We continue to drive improvements in our operational structure around our data center infrastructure. Those are probably some of the bigger items that we have there. And we have some good pathway over the next several years also. But Open will be an important focus area and I think you may have missed this, but as Jeff indicated earlier, the initial view of the synergy benefits, we have visibility, and the more, as sit here today, we have to finalize that, but I think we've identified more as the work has gotten into a lot of details. So we're pleased about that also.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And just a quick housekeeping question, Tom, do you have a quarter end share count?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes. 133.2, David.","Operator","David Koning from Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, my first question just on the Open revenue themselves. I think this quarter you said acquisition revenues came in at about $65 million. Should that ramp through the year, including -- I would guess, first of all, you just pro rata that into Q2 and it might suggest $80 million or so of revs in Q2 since you'll have a full quarter. But is there any real seasonality or -- I think you said you expect some growth from that through the year?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, absolutely, Dave. And this is Tom. First of all, to your point, it was a partial quarter. So you do have to do that annualization. Secondly, we are continuing to make a lot of momentum as far as the business goes. As Jeff highlighted, we had 5 new DNA sales in the quarter. The pipeline continues to grow, so we anticipate a sequential improvement in that business as the year goes on, as we sell well with the integration with the clients and the prospects, et cetera. So we're on track but we did anticipate that we'd have quarter-over-quarter lift, both from a revenue standpoint and then clearly, the synergy benefits, which are going to kick in largely in the second half of the year, and that was factored into our plan.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I would say the only other -- to your question on seasonality, Dave, there is some seasonality in that business in that it tends to be a little bit more license heavy than the rest of Fiserv. And therefore, their sales to existing clients typically were biased towards the end of the year as institutions have a better handle on their budgets. So we would expect to see that as well.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just my second question just interest expense. That, I think that was $41 million in Q1. How -- I know there were some moving parts with Open that, that being pretty high during a small part of Q1 and Open coming on probably through the quarter, how do you kind of see interest expense normalizing over the next couple of quarters?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, Dave, I don't think we're going to -- we have -- your question was around interest expense, right? Dave, I -- you let out a little bit early on so...","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, that's exactly right. Just kind of wondering after Q1, which had a few moving parts just kind of how we should see that progress through the rest of the year?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I don't think -- it might be slightly down as we continue to pay off a little debt, but I think it's going to be pretty close to sequential down, very slightly as we go through the rest of the year.","Operator","Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer & Company.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess, the first question, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the commentary around Open Solutions and the synergies and I think the direct quote has opportunity to unlock value more than you originally anticipated. And it sounds like you're talking about synergies now in the back half of the year. What I think I remember from the fourth quarter call was that you were thinking about more the synergy will start in 2014. So maybe just a little bit of color about what you have observed and found that makes you more optimistic on the synergy side? And am I right to be thinking that you're seeing the synergies you're going to realize them sooner than was earlier anticipated?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So you are right in terms of timing. I would say that our optimism in Open has come really in 3 baskets. The first one is the teams have worked extraordinary well together, a lot of transparency, and so we are capturing some of the synergies earlier than we thought. And the synergies really come on both sides. They come in terms of -- from the Open acquisition, as well as we pull some of our businesses together. So we're seeing some synergy benefits in terms of the timing. And then in the second basket, we're also believing that the total synergy value on the cost side is going to likely be larger than the $50 million that we talked about. And that will also help us to have a little bit more benefit this year. Now for clarity, I will say that our guidance for the year, right, the range, the 15% to 19% -- or 15% to 18% and now 15% to 19% range allowed for higher levels of synergy value. If you think about what the per share amounts are and that it's on a route, and you're not going to get a full year, it's impossible for us to get a full year of synergies on anything because of when we close. So that is accounted for in there, but again it helps us to be even more confident about where we're going to land. And then the third basket, and I think the one that I'm most excited about, is the revenue opportunity is significantly larger than I thought. And I believe we will see earlier wins than we really anticipated. And that's really a function of the comfort that the Open clients seem to have with us as a partner. There was this palpable sense of relief that the clients felt in terms of knowing that their provider was going to be around. And then the opportunity to look at the full suite of solutions that we have that, frankly, Open did not have, and that was a core thesis to our acquisition. But to see it live at our client conference with a record number of Open attendees and I've had the pleasure of meeting with a number of the Open clients one-on-one, I can honestly tell you that there is a very strong willingness to benefit from the bundles of value that we can bring in. So for those reasons, I think we will see both larger amounts of synergies and more benefit in this year than we anticipated. And of course, the larger of the benefits will be in the cost side because revenue has to ramp and most of that will not occur really until the third and fourth quarters in terms of the actual revenue benefit this year.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","All right. That's encouraging. And then just to drill down on the sales commentary, the 25% sales growth, I mean, maybe you can help us. Give us a little color or maybe by segment maybe talk about the market environment. I think you did have a relatively easy comparison but just try and understand like the macroenvironment, your sale success and where you really saw it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, that's great. On the macro side, I would say that the big winners were digital. Our digital businesses were up substantially on a year-over-year basis, so thinking about mobile, online and the connected capabilities to those services. We also saw great success in international. We had some nice international wins during the year. You may remember that about a year and change ago, we formed our -- an international business, where we had really been doing things I would say more opportunistically. We have -- we put one of our strongest leaders on top of international and we're starting to see some momentum there, so we were excited about that, that sales performance. And then we had good progress actually on the bank solution side, so in the account processing wins, we had some nice wins there. And then we had just a smattering of good deals in other places, but those are the big ones. And I would say, on the bill payment side, we were about even. The larger pill payment wins really occurred later on in the year. So in the first quarter, we were kind of flattish on that side.","Operator","Brett Huff from Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","My 2 questions are, one, is a bigger picture one, which is how has the world changed now that you all have acquired Open? The TCI has swallowed a couple of folks. We're starting to see some consolidation, I think people have been expecting for a while. Has that changed the way you look at the world, the opportunities you see or the way you're going to try and go-to-market? Or just give us your thoughts on -- and if that has changed anything.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I would say that the way in which it's changed is for us, we have less competitors to consider. So on one hand, the competitors are potentially larger or -- not potentially, they are larger. But instead of having -- I'm going to use this only illustratively -- instead of having 20 competitors, we have 10. So it's easier to know those 10 competitors than it is to know the 20. So on that side, that's a good thing. We're not seeing -- in these newer consolidations, we're not seeing any pricing that is concerning, so that's good news. And I would say, it's really a value proposition. As the market gets healthier, it's more of a value proposition, what are you bringing to bear? As I mentioned at the Open thesis, we're seeing it play out quite well. And then the other piece of it that we're focused on really from a macro standpoint, Brett, is realtime. I mean we really believe that the days of being able to cloak vast transactions in realtime will come to an end as consumers require information and access the way they are. And one of the interesting examples is even the Bank of the West Quick Balance technology. Imagine a technology that allows you to check the balance without having to log in to that app. Now you have to authenticate through the device, but it's really requiring data to move in a much more clear and concise and quick fashion. So from that macro, that's one of the reasons why we thought that Open was important as those technology demands change. But competitively, it's a competitive market. It's going to continue to be a competitive market and we're excited to out there and compete everyday.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one -- second question, in terms of Popmoney, it sounds like you're -- you've got PNC as a key partner going live with the newest realtime stuff. And you mentioned I think really good transaction growth. What can you tell us about how you're seeing people use that, the use cases, are they sort of panning out as you thought they would? Or was -- what's been surprising? Do you see pockets that you are -- that all of a sudden more interesting in terms of potential addressable market or others that are going away? Any change now that we're deeper into that rollout?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I would say that if you -- we went through the use cases that we considered back in 2009 when we started ZashPay, and started to think about ZashPay, I would say that there are very little crossover between what we thought the primary use cases would be and why they are. And that's actually great news because the use cases that are developing are use cases that we've seen time and time again within our bill payment technology. And a number of them are quite well-suited for realtime. The other thing that I like is what we're seeing on the Popmoney side is a merchant, customer, financial institution triumvirate in that there's value being exchanged equally between those 3 parties. And I think there are ways for us to change that materially, increase the value for each of those parties, which as we talked about at Investor Day, we actually think is upwards around $10 billion of ultimately new financial institution fee revenue, but not crappy fee revenue and I mean that by not fees that are assessed on customers that, where they don't see value. These are fees that customers are going to be willing to pay, not unlike a foreign ATM charge where there is real value being exchanged. So we have a lot of bullishness around social payments, around Popmoney. It's one of the reasons why we continue to push the number of what we are thinking about as member institutions in the Popmoney network. And I think you're going to see a lot of movement on that front this year, at least from us. Signing STAR, bringing STAR into the value proposition and now allowing us to be ACCEL and STAR. I mean that's a lot of coverage in a financial institution arena for realtime. So that, we think, Popmoney, by itself, is an interesting value proposition. But Popmoney coupled with realtime is game-changing. And when you compare that to your point, to the use cases, there's a lot of opportunity out there and we're quite excited about it.","Operator","Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan Securities.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let me ask about the bill pay ramp ups and just trying to make sure that those conversions are in-flight and any risk of sort of cold feet pushout by the banks? And I'm curious is there a way to set a high-level frame for us? Once you fully implement everyone, including Wells, what that would add to your volume growth in bill pay? Just give us a perspective on the magnitude of those wins.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So it's easier for me to comment on the first one. And not surprising, we did check the status of each of the large implementations prior to the call. And we are in great shape on the larger implementations. So I don't expect -- I mean, listen, there's always a shock that something will get moved, a month or a few weeks or whatever the case may be. But I don't see any of these getting materially pushed. Now again, I'm not within the institutions but I don't see that. Take TD, for example. TD, they did everything they can actually to move their installation that forward. They're so focused on driving value through the bill payment technology that they were doing everything they could to pull it forward. And so we -- just given the momentum in the market, I don't see that happening. As it relates to can we give guidance on the growth rates, I think it would be imprudent to do that right now because there will be movements in the quarters. But as you know, because you're so familiar with bill pay, as these institutions come on, we're going to have several years of growth, transaction growth, as they both use it to promote to new consumers and use it -- use -- kind of see each of the individual consumers come up to speed. The other thing that we're focused on which will, we believe, be a little bit different than we've seen in other large institutions, the installs of the other large institutions, is we have grown our e-bill distribution a lot over the last couple of years. I think we've added multiple billion dollars -- multiple billions of bills for e-bill distribution. So that is a much superior value prop that these new institutions will be able to experience or the customers of the institutions will be able to experience. So I think we will have significantly greater levels of transaction growth sequentially each quarter through the year, and we expect that momentum to continue into '14. Obviously, Wells won't come on until January of next year, but we expect that to be important volume as well.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, Tien, that TD went live at the end of March, so that is what is right now is the benefit that's going forward here in the second quarter and forward.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Got it. And I'm sure they're facing and obviously, to take advantage of all those benefits, including, e-bill. So we'll just keep on that as they come aboard. I know they're big ones. Just on the lower license sales again, couple of quarters in a row there. I know enterprise software has been kind of tough for a lot of folks. How much of that is cyclical in your mind this quarter versus maybe just Fiserv being more focused on hosted solutions or focusing on the recurring stuff? I'm just trying to understand if this is more than a cyclical issue? I think I may have asked this last quarter even.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think you know that our license fees are now probably roughly about 4% of our total revenue and as you know, they fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We did, in this quarter, have a tough compare to the first quarter of '12 because we had carryover from '11 so it made the little bit more difficult. But there's clearly a trend over time, as you know, in the core comp processing, more trends to outsourcing versus licensed solutions. And clearly, even in areas such as Mobiliti, online, they're looking to host those applications versus license. So I think there's always going to be that license revenue. But clearly, the trend is towards more outsourcing solutions and it's not a big number for us, so -- and clearly we've adjusted our plan appropriately in '13 given what we had in '12 from a license standpoint. But we're pleased actually with that trend. I mean, it generates recurring revenue, more scale, more opportunities to distribute more of our products and it's really beneficial over the long haul.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, one of the interesting examples of that is I mentioned we've got a couple of larger online clients coming or Online Banking clients coming online in the middle of the year. And one of them would have had very material license revenue -- been very material license and professional services revenue that we have been unable to recognize any revenue because we agreed to host that solution for the client, which have better -- it's better cash flow, it's longer, it will allow us to actually be in better shape as it relates to other products. We expect to actually add mobile to that client this year, which will be a very material add. However, it changes the nature in which we are able to recognize that revenue. So I do think there is a secular edge do that. And to -- honestly, to the extent that we have the opportunities to create more NPV, we're going to bias to that even if it impacts us in the short run. The majority of the license revenue though that we saw impacting us in Q4 and this Q1 are not giant enterprise licenses. They're smaller licenses. We've had a couple of refreshes in our risk portfolio and some other areas that will come back online later on this year. So there is some cyclicality to that as well. But as you know, we're strongly biasing the processing and recurring revenue. And so we're going to always look for those opportunities where we can find them.","Operator","Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs & Co.","Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First, I wanted to touch on you've been really bullish on the realtime capability. Can you provide some detail around the different channels that you might target with this capability? I guess I'm most interested in any kind of non-FI use cases. I mean, are you considering potentially powering merchant, decoupled debit programs, or anything to do with retail consumer payments as opposed to just P2P or bill payment. How disruptive basically you're willing to get with this pretty powerful capability.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So I guess the way we think about our priorities is we believe we have an obligation to make technologies available to financial institutions, to issuers first. That's our #1 desire. That's our #1 focus and we are doing everything we can to make sure financial institutions have an edge versus non-financial institutions and other competitors. However, within our segment orientation, we said we have 3 primary focus areas. Financial institutions, billers and consumers. And so we are always looking for ways in the market in which we can deliver technology solutions that help improve the quality of the services or in some cases, the lives of consumers everyday. So for example, we have a consumer direct site called MyCheckFree, where we have a couple of million consumers who work with us every month to pay bills electronically, and certainly, we are looking for opportunities to enhance those experiences and make those available, make realtime available in places such as that. So I would say that as it relates to things like decoupled debit, I would say that's pretty low on our priority list. Again, we have an allegiance to financial institutions but we also understand that in order to win over time, everyone wins if there's more network and more ubiquity. And so we're looking for different ways to distribute outside that channel where it makes sense.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's really helpful. My second question has to do with the Open Solutions integration. How difficult has the process been of switching the legacy Acumen customer to DNA? Had there been any sign of client loss when you proposed converting to DNA? Did you have to go back and resell DNA to Acumen customers who won't rollout yet? I mean, basically, has the conversion been sort of clean or messy?","Mark A. Ernst","Ramsey, this is Mark Ernst. Let me take that one. It's a little early to fully answer that. We've, obviously, been having very deep discussions with each one of the Acumen clients, both those who have been live and as well as those who are in process. I would characterize the conversations we've been having thus far as very positive. We have been very happy with the reaction that we're seeing from the clients, who were formerly committed to Acumen, and they've gotten to know the DNA product all over again. As we have described DNA as a product, it was in many ways, sort of the equivalent of what Acumen was building. So I think the buyers of Acumen, who are buying both for the technology as well as for the stability and the long-term partnership of Fiserv, are finding that the DNA technology is very comparable and therefore -- and a bit more mature. So therefore, they're pleased so far with what they're seeing with DNA. They like the partnership aspects of Fiserv. So all in all, I'd say it's going very well. It's just that we -- these are complex conversations with a whole host of different parties, so we are working through those one at a time.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","And I would say many cases, just to accentuate Mark's point, in many cases where people selected Acumen, it came down to 2 choices and Acumen was usually #1 or it was sometimes #1 and DNA was almost always the #2 because it was the only other kind of what I would call, technologically advanced system in the market. So from that perspective, people are generally familiar. And in many cases, what they did not have, what Open did not have is they didn't have the stability of the partner of the company so there was concerns about their financial viability. But they also didn't have all of the different solutions within their own family that they could deliver in a single integrated bundle. And that's really where we're driving value today. Interestingly, and one of the things that we've learned more about is Open had been out doing a fair amount of work replicating some of the Acumen capabilities that we were winning in the market. It's exactly what you would expect a competitor to do. So in some of the early releases that we expect to put out this year, some of those capabilities are already embedded. So the good news is as the Acumen clients are fairly pleased with that. The only other comment I should make is, and I should have thought about this earlier, is on the license revenue comment, one of the reasons why license revenue was down year-over-year is because of the Acumen clients, which in many cases were tending to be in-house clients. That license revenue, we were not getting that at the end of last year and we've actually not -- we're not getting it this year either yet. So that's one of the other benefits of making these DNA or getting these DNA conversions done is we'll get back to bringing some of that revenue back in.","Operator","Our last question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank securities.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish calling on behalf of Bryan. A quick follow-up question on Acumen and the DNA discussion. I was just wondering, is your decision to migrate from Acumen platform to DNA, is that affecting or creating any kind of confusion in the marketplace? And has that impacted license sales in or -- yes, any color that you can give on that front?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","No, I would say actually -- and Mark, you should fill in if I'm missing something. I mean, we actually wanted to make it extraordinarily clear at the time of the acquisition that DNA was going to be our go-forward platform. And while at times, some of the Acumen clients clearly were not happy with that, and we understand why 100%, we want to make it very clear to the market what our go-forward platform was going to be and we did that. So that's actually been quite helpful in terms of making sure there's good market clarity and allow us to really focus, not on a debate on which platform is the right platform, but how can we move people forward.","Mark A. Ernst","I think the only confusion that we heard of early on was some confusion because Acumen is really a credit union-focused platform and DNA service both credit unions and banks. There was some confusion or at least some question about whether we were altering the positioning of DNA. But I think we've worked hard to clarify that we see a position in the market for both DNA in the bank market, as well as DNA in the credit union market, so we will continue to support both those different industry types.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And a quick question on gross profit and specifically the product cost. If my numbers are right, I see that the product cost has gone up slightly, is that related to Open? And how do you expect the gross profit to trend through the rest of the year, if you could just provide some color on that front?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think if you look at the press release, we did take a -- we had write-off in cost of product that was the impairment, non-cash impairment charge, that went through that line item. As you see in the P&L, it's a footnote on the bottom. So when you take that out, it's really comparable on a year-over-year basis.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so expectations for going forward, was this a onetime charge?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","That's correct.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, we'll take it back. And we'll get that back to normal in the second quarter.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Great.

Joining me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; and our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Hirsch.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted revenue, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, free cash flow per share, sales pipelines, acquisitions and our strategic initiatives.","Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.

Yabuki","Thanks, Eric. So great job on your inaugural call. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I get to our results, let me thank each of you who joined us for our Annual Investor Conference, either in person or digitally, on October 9. We provided an update on our key solutions and how we're executing against our algorithm for growth. This formula sets forth how we intend to enhance revenue growth across our cadre of market-leading businesses and also our plans to scale our newer, innovation-based solutions, such as Popmoney and Mobiliti. We believe we are on track to achieve increasing levels of high-quality revenue growth.","We also highlighted the important opportunities to expand operating margin, further enhance our already compelling free cash flow per share and our consistent and disciplined approach to capital. Our strategies are well aligned with the evolving market. We're enthusiastic about our multiple opportunities to create additional value for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Now on to the results.","We're pleased with our performance for the quarter and year-to-date and are well positioned to achieve our expectations for the full year. We again generated strong earnings growth, with adjusted EPS increasing 9% to $1.27 in the quarter and is up 13% to $3.75 for the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the quarter and is up 4% through September 30. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin increased sharply to 29.8%, 80 basis points over the prior year's quarter and up 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin to date has increased 40 basis points to 29.3%, led by strong performance in the Financial segment and solid execution of our operational efficiency objectives.","Free cash flow increased 18% to $203 million compared with the third quarter of 2011, driven by strong growth in operating earnings and favorable shifts in working capital. Year-to-date free cash flow was down slightly from the prior year period to $501 million, primarily related to higher tax payments and working capital shifts early this year. We expect a strong free cash flow quarter to end the year.","For 2012, we identified 3 enterprise priorities, when taken together, represent key elements of our formula to create sustained shareholder value. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients. Revenue growth accelerated in the quarter, as we benefited from robust sales and strong performance across our leading solutions such as Debit Account Processing and Mobile. The combination of increased operating leverage and continued achievement of operational effectiveness goals resulted in 8% growth in adjusted operating income in the quarter and 80 basis points of margin expansion. Adjusted EPS growth was solid in the quarter as well. Even net of a negative comparative tax impact, it has increased 13% through September 30. We're on track for another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","Our focus on building a culture of growth continues to translate to strong sales performance. After the expected slow start to the year, the second and third quarters had strong, above-quarter performance, which included another major bill payment win, Regions Bank, that we announced at Investors Day. That transaction, along with the signing of signing of TD Bank in the second quarter, is factual evidence that financial institutions continue to desire the significant product differentiation offered by CheckFree RXP. As we shared at Investor Day, we expect to see revenue growth acceleration in our bill payment business in 2013 and well beyond.","We had more than 140 new Mobiliti signings in the quarter, driven largely by existing relationships in our account processing and online banking client base. As of quarter's end, we have nearly 1,300 mobile banking clients and a still significant growth opportunity, driven by the combination of mobile adoption and new FI clients.","Our goal of delivering differentiation and innovation that leads to better results for our clients progressed well in the quarter. We have several solutions that straddle the unique intersection of strong consumer value and financial institution revenue. A great example is Popmoney. We signed more than 100 new clients in the quarter and now have over 1,700 institutions in the social payments network. We added BB&T Corporation, one of the largest financial holding companies in the U.S. to the Popmoney network, which now includes 14 of the top 30 banks.","We believe realtime transaction processing is a critical Fiserv differentiator. This capability should provide new revenue opportunities for our clients, which we believe will ultimately be measured in the billions. And it's important institutions can provide unique user experiences in areas such as social payments, expedited bill pay and SpotPay, our new product, which allows small business customers to accept card-based payments through a mobile phone, courtesy of their own financial institution.","And as we shared at Investor Day, our concept of expanding realtime movement is real now. In live Popmoney demonstrations, we've successfully debited the sender's account and credited the receiver's account at a different institution within 20 seconds of initiating the transaction. Integrating our proprietary DDA-based payments applications with our PIN-debit Network should create exceptional value for our clients and their customers, which will translate to attractive new growth for Fiserv, a true win-win.","With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom, who will provide more detail on our financial results.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the third quarter to $1.05 billion and increased 4% in the first 9 months of 2012 to $3.1 billion. As anticipated, adjusted internal revenue growth in the third quarter accelerated over the second quarter to 4% and is now at 3% year-to-date.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.27 in the quarter and increased 13% to $3.75 through September 30. Earnings in the quarter was negatively impacted by $0.04 per share due to an almost 2-percentage-point lower tax rate in the prior year's third quarter.","Adjusted operating income was up 8% to $312 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 29.8%, up 80 basis points over the prior year. For the first 9 months, adjusted operating income increased 5% to $910 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 29.3% compared to the prior year. The combined license and termination fee revenue through September 30 is about the same as last year.","Now on to the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 4% to $548 million in the quarter and is up 5% to $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 2% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Card services and digital channels continue to drive strong internal revenue growth, which is partially offset by weaker performance in bill payment, investment services and the continued negative Durbin impact on our Biller Solutions business.","Bill payment transactions declined 2% in the quarter. This decline is due primarily to a lower number of non-weekend bill payment processing days in September, which accounted for an approximate 3-percentage-point decline in the quarter, which, we expect, will reverse in the fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate higher growth in our bill payment business in 2013 in light of the recent large signings of TD Bank, Regions Bank and our still strong pipeline of additional opportunities.","Debit transactions grew 15% in the quarter and are up 18% year-to-date, primarily from better-than-market transaction growth and on-boarding of new clients. We've added 125 new debit clients so far this year and expect a strong sales finish to the year.","Our Popmoney ramp is continuing with transactions up 111% and 119% in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Our focus on building the network is critical, as more consumers are exposed to this new technology. As you know, Popmoney is yet to meaningfully contribute to our revenue.","Operating income for the quarter was $168 million in the Payments segment compared with $162 million in the third quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, operating income was $489 million compared to $482 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 30.7% for the quarter, down slightly from the prior year period and up 90 basis points sequentially. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin for the segment was down 90 basis points, primarily due to the impact of previously discussed bill payment deconversions, the expected dilution from the acquisition and integration of CashEdge and the impact of ramping up our offerings in mobile and online banking.","Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment rebounded as anticipated, increasing 5% to $513 million in the quarter compared with the prior year. Year-to-date internal revenue growth was 3%. The timing of license revenue also rebounded in the quarter, as expected, compared to the second quarter of this year. The gains in year-over-year revenue are primarily driven by recurring revenue growth in our account processing and lending businesses.","Operating income in the Financial segment was up 15% to $165 million for the quarter, and operating margin expanded by 270 basis points to 32.1%. This performance is driven by a number of factors, including the higher license and termination fee revenue, efficiency gains and item processing, our operational effectiveness initiatives and an easier comparison to the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date, operating income was up 10% to $479 million, and operating margin has increased 190 basis points to 31.6%, in each case, compared with the prior year.","The operating loss in the Corporate segment for the third quarter was $21 million, consistent with our second quarter operating loss and $6 million greater than the third quarter last year.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.6%, an increase of almost 2 percentage points over the 34.7% rate in 2011. Last year's third quarter rate was much lower due to a number of timing items that, in the aggregate, positively impacted the period.","Our full year adjusted tax rate is projected to be approximately 36% and 37% in the fourth quarter. Net interest expenses declined $9 million year-to-date versus the prior year, primarily due to lower interest rates.","Free cash flow rebounded nicely in the quarter, consistent with our plan of stronger second-half performance. Free cash flow in the quarter was $203 million compared to $172 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 18%. For the first 9 months of 2012, free cash flow was $501 million, down slightly to the prior year and negatively impacted in the current year by higher tax payments and incentive accruals paid in the first quarter of the year. Free cash flow per share through September 30 was up 3% to $3.62 compared to the prior year period.","Total debt at September 30 was $3.45 billion or 2.4x trailing 12 months' EBITDA. In September, we raised $700 million of 10-year public debt at a coupon rate of 3.5%. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our $1.1 billion term loan, which is due in November of 2012. The effective interest rate on the new debt will be higher than the coupon due to the interest rate derivatives entered into a few years ago and settled in conjunction with the recent transaction. However, the overall debt cost on the new financing will be lower than the existing term loan. We are very well positioned with our debt structure. And after the paydown of our term loan in November, we will not have a mandatory principal payment until late 2015.","We repurchased 2.7 million shares of stock in the quarter for $189 million. And year-to-date, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares for $577 million. As of September 30, there were approximately 6.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Tom. Sales in the quarter were again strong with quota attainment at 116%. Actual sales value in the quarter was more than 40% higher than last year's Q3 and just below the stellar results of this year's second quarter. Our digital channels and payments businesses led the performance, including, as we highlighted earlier, some great wins for our Popmoney and bill payment products. We are at 99% sales quota attainment on a straight-line basis through the end of the third quarter. Our qualified pipeline remains strong and is above where it was at this time last year. We expect to meet our annual sales target for the year.","Integrated sales were also solid in the quarter, with payments and channel solutions, again, experiencing the highest demand. Through the first 9 months of the year, integrated sales were $120 million or roughly 60% of our annual target. We also expect to achieve our 2012 objective of $200 million.","We had another strong quarter of operational effectiveness performance and, through September 30, are now at $45 million in cost savings or 113% of our full year target.","As we shared at Investor Day, the environment facing financial institutions is stable but continues to be somewhat challenged. And while technology spend is growing slowly, it is still growing. We believe institutions will focus their technology decisions on areas that contribute to enhanced customer experience, create revenue and drive operational excellence. Technology solutions that deliver tangible, measurable value will likely get the lion's share of available spend and that lines up very well with our overall positioning.","Through September 30, on the regulatory front, there have been 52 actions, down significantly from 91 in the same period last year. Total assets of the impacted institutions are down significantly to about $10 billion compared with $34 billion in 2011.","As we said up front, we're on track to achieve results for 2012 within our guidance. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth in the 3% to 4.5% range, both with a bias to the lower end of the range for the full year. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.08 to $5.20, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year, as compared to $4.58 in 2011. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand in the range of 30 to 60 basis points for the full year, free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and free cash flow per share to be at least $5.70 for the full year.","We continue to move the business forward each day, with a singular goal of making your company stronger. We have made strategic progress and remain bullish","[Audio Gap]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Togut from Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Jeff, it's David Togut. Can you walk through some of the biggest drivers of the 5% organic revenue growth in Financial? And do you see this continuing for the balance of the year and into 2013?","[Technical Difficulty]","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Can you repeat the question? I think you were talking about the revenue growth, but we just want to make sure.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. What were the key drivers of the 5% organic revenue growth in Financial during the third quarter? And to what extent is this growth sustainable for the balance of the year and into 2013?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes. Clearly, David, we just had a really good quarter in our Financial segment. As you know, coming off the second quarter, which was a little bit more abnormally low, because we had some timing of license revenue. But we had a solid revenue quarter from a license standpoint. We had -- did have a little higher termination fees. But we had a strong quarter, as Jeff highlighted, in both account processing and our lending business which continue to have a strong performance. And as you know, the Financial segment has bounced around a little bit. And -- we look at it from a year-to-date standpoint. So clearly, good progress. 3% organic revenue growth from the Financial segment, which we're pleased with, and really solid across those recurring revenue businesses. But the growth rate is going to bounce around as license fees do impact that particular segment.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","What were the termination fees in the third quarter?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Roughly, as a company, they were approximately $9 million, which was, I think, up, David, about $4 million to $5 million over the prior year quarter. But as another reminder, year-to-date, from a contract termination fee and our license fees, they're about flat with the prior year. So I always tend to look at those on a year-to-date basis for better comparisons.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. And just as a quick follow-up, when would you expect Payments' organic revenue growth to pick up as a result of the Regions Bank and TD Bank wins? And can you quantify the impact to revenue from these 2 wins for FY '13?","Thomas J. Hirsch","So those transactions will go live, obviously, some time in '13. They'll have different dates. And I think we had a slide up at Investor Day, which said that those 2 banks, plus Zions, had about 8 million accounts that would potentially be able to be within or would potentially be able to take bill pay. And so if you just think about normal percentages of pay grade against that, it could be as low as 10%. And typically, banks of that size are running at a higher level into the upper teens. So on a percentage basis, if you think about that, relative to the 24 million active bill pay accounts we have today, that's probably the best way to think about it, knowing of course, that, that will ramp over time. So we think they'll have important contributions to our growth in '13. But as we have a -- we won't have a full year until we get into '14. We think that'll be strong growth. And we're also going to benefit from the anniversary-ing of some of the negatives, like the Wachovia deconversion and a couple of remit and bar deconversions that we had this year as well.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes. I think you'll -- to add to that, David, I think you'll continue to see sequential improvement in that growth rate as we move forward.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Quick final question for me, Jeff. The American Banker had a big article on the community bank market last week, a pretty negative piece citing higher capital requirements, tough pressure on net interest margin. Any updated thoughts, just on your customers and their overall spending levels with Fiserv, particularly community bank customers?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Sure. We -- one of the things that we talked about at Investor Day at some depth is the overall pressure that is in the financial institution space. And community banks nor credit unions are exempt from that. I think the capital requirements are the capital -- yes, the capital requirements under Basel III would certainly put more pressure on the industry. That said, most of the community bankers -- a substantial majority of the community bankers, that I interact with, understand that the model is changing and that they need to make investments in technology that allow them to actually be more efficient, serve their customers in a different way and look for some other product opportunities to drive additional revenue. And that's one of the reasons why, frankly, we're quite bullish about the technologies that we have within our suite. It's one of the reasons why we have such a strong take-up in things like Popmoney and Mobiliti. And as much as that model will be under pressure, the beauty of it is, as these institutions have really taken the expense side down and really been more -- I think more prudent around their expense model, as revenues start to come back online, and they certainly will at some point, you'll see more of a fall-through. So I think most of the bankers are preparing for that inevitability. We are not at all bearish on the community banks base. We think it's an attractive space. We think structurally within the U.S., you need to have significant -- a significant community bank system. And there's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that, that's going to change.","Operator","The next question is from Dave Koning from Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And I guess my first question, just on bill pay, I know, prior to kind of the last 4 quarters, you always grew transactions in the ballpark of 6% to 9% for many quarters. Can you get back to there on kind of a -- on a normalized basis? Even without Regions and TD and Zions, can you get back there, just as some of the remittance-only stuff anniversaries? Or do you think we're going to be a little below that, but get the benefit of adding some of these bigger banks?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, it's a great question and one that we think about on a fairly regular basis. We have continued to win a large number of bill payment clients every quarter. So when we think about our transaction growth really benefit from 2 areas -- we benefit from new wins within really the account processing distribution platform. And then secondly, kind of the growth of transactions -- kind of natural growth of transactions, which is a function of the number of makers that you have and the number of transactions per maker. Frankly, since 2008, we've seen transactions be frankly lower as less people -- or people have been paying less bills. And so we've had some issues with that, and I think that's one of the things that's been running through the numbers. So part of the answer to the question is, when will that stabilize? And we think it has. And we would expect to see that begin to move back up. I think the other thing that we talked about at Investor Day, that we're really excited about, is the opportunity to basically move bill payments on a faster basis, whether they're faster bill payments or expedited or realtime. We think that is not going to just create interesting fee opportunities but have people use bill payment on a more frequent or regular basis. So we think that will help as well. All of that said, I think it would be conjecture to understand, can we get that number back up to 6% to 9% without winning deals? And I think the reality is, we need to do all of that. We need to win deals. We need to continue to innovate our product to deliver better and more impactful ways for institutions to benefit from bill payment and for consumers to use the technology. So I feel like we're in -- I think we're in a good position. I do think we'll see very strong transaction growth coming from these new wins. And frankly, we expect to continue to win deals moving forward. So even though we have a pretty high penetration in, call it, the top-30-or-so banks in the U.S., we have a pretty good opportunity to extend below the top 30 into, call it, banks 30 to 100. And so we're quite focused on that area as well.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the Durbin headwind that started to have impact you, I think that started in early October of last year, kind of the way it flowed through your business in the Payments segment. I guess, the anniversary of that, does that really start to benefit in Q4 this year and maybe by how much about?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Well, Dave, when we gave our guidance, I think we said roughly about 50 basis points for the year. And there continues to be some of that impact, just given the nature of what that is. So I think you're going to continue to see some of that in the fourth quarter.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","But I think Dave, to your point, you'll see that start to lift as we move through -- we did start -- it started kind of later in the fourth quarter last year, and some of that pressure will diminish as we move into '13.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my final, just quick one is, the guidance range on EPS is still pretty wide. I don't think you made a comment about kind of where it might fall in that. I'm just wondering if we should expect kind of the upper end of that range or if you just want to keep it wide for now.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes. I mean, we're -- we -- you probably remember that in the second quarter, we actually moved up -- we moved up our range by, what, $0.04 in the quarter or as of the end of June. And one of the variants that we always have going into the fourth quarter is the amount of license revenue. And as we talked about before, that can bounce around. And it's about $2.5 million per $0.01. So from our perspective, we see some variability there. And we think the range that we lay out is the right range for the remainder of the year.","Operator","The next question is from Glenn Greene, Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'll ask just so [ph] in the interest of getting disconnected potentially. Last call, 3 questions and then just hop out. First one, the sales strength from the quarter, if I heard right, is 40% year-over-year. Just wanted to understand the key items that drove that and within that, how much Zions contributed. Second question, the bill pay comments related to fiscal '13, if I heard it right, it suggests the acceleration. And I understand that TD and Regions, but wanted to know if that reflected the drag from the BofA renewal. And the third is the integrated sales goal of $200 million that suggests a heck of a fourth quarter to get there. What kind of gives you the confidence to get there?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Sure. So we'll start with the last one first, and then we'll move through them. So as it relates to integrated sales, we feel quite confident. Last year, we actually had quite a strong fourth quarter, I think around $70 million. Because what we can see in our pipeline, we feel like there are a lot of good-sized deals that will come in, in the quarter. So we're confident there, given it's only a few million dollars higher than we saw last year in Q4. So that gives us confidence. On the second point, which is really on the bill pay acceleration, we really see that growth coming from the wins that we have had, the anniversary-ing of the Wachovia and some of the other deconverts that we talked about earlier in the year, and obviously, offset by the -- by any discount we were to give -- we are to give to Bank of America. So -- but we -- as we talked about at Investor Day, we have a good level of confidence and growth in '13, but not just in '13. As we talked about these transactions, institutions are going to ramp up. And we have a good, solid pipeline there. And we believe we'll continue to win transactions. And then last, from a Zions perspective, most of the growth that we see in '13 will not come from Zions. Zions would be smallest of the 3 big deals that we quantify. We'll get some nice growth there, but it won't be the largest of all of them.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes. And I think your other question was, Glenn, around the strength of our sales performance on a year-over-year basis and continues to be driven by our digital channels business. A lot of activity there. You saw some of the Popmoney wins. You saw our bill payment wins. And the other thing I would say is that we still have a very good pipeline in that particular business and along with a lot of our other businesses. So our pipeline continues to be strong. And so from a sales standpoint, we feel good going into the finishing out the year on a strong basis. And a lot of those sales have been more recurring revenue or long-term, recurring revenue versus license and debt. That's a good thing for the long-term nature of our business and especially, the size of some of these wins, which are a lot larger than what we've seen as a company, kind of across the board when you look at the breadth of the wins that we have, not just in bill payment but in other areas, larger transactions, which I think is contributing to that year-over-year increase in our performance in the third quarter of roughly 40% from a sales standpoint.","Operator","The next is from Chris Shutler from William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First one, I just wanted to gauge your confidence in your ability to hit the long-term internal revenue growth target for the first 3-year period, which I think is 2011 to 2013. Just given all the things like Durbin, BofA, et cetera, it seems like that would a bit of a stretch to hit that. So just wanted to gauge your confidence in that.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Are -- and Chris, are you talking about kind of over the 3-year period?","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Correct.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes. I mean, obviously, we're not going to give guidance for '13 at this point. I think what we have said is, from a notional standpoint, we expect to have growth higher in '13 than '12. But we'll deal with that question in a little bit more depth in February.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, figured I'd try. And then Tom, the weighted average interest rate that we should look out for Q4 as opposed to Q3?","Thomas J. Hirsch","It's going to be slightly lower, just given the fact of that recent refinancing, but shouldn't be material but it will be slightly lower going into the end of the year.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","On the term loan, what was the rate that you were paying?","Thomas J. Hirsch","It was somewhere around 5 plus on that thing when -- because some of that debt was FX. So there's going to be a slight benefit in Q4 and slight benefit as we look into '13.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","And then we'll pay off the balance of the term loan not until -- kind of November, right?","Thomas J. Hirsch","November, that's correct.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then you might have mentioned this earlier, I'm not sure, but the term fees and the breakout between the 2 segments?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, it's a combination of both. We don't typically give that breakout between the 2. But there's -- I think it was, as I indicated, I think, $9 million roughly in the quarter. It was up $4 million to $5 million over the prior year. And I think you'll have a couple of million in each, because we have some in each segment. And so that's roughly where it was at.","Operator","Our last question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish calling on behalf of Bryan. Quick question on the strength in the Financial segment. So you've highlighted license wins and the termination fees as the less [ph] strength in the processing business. I was wondering how do you -- when you think about the fourth quarter and all the macroeconomic uncertainty, how should we think about Financial segment going forward? Just -- do you expect the same kind of license revenue strength to persist? And also, any indication on what the term fee expectations are for the fourth quarter?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So let me just -- I guess let me just back up just to make sure I answer that question appropriately. The -- as you know our business, we tend to have volatility as termination fees and license fees. And they move quarter-to-quarter. As I highlighted year-to-date, when you look at the first 9 months of the year compared to the prior year, our license fees and our term fees just about offset. So they're about flat when you look at that compared to the prior year period. And those can move around as we go from quarter-to-quarter. And we're not going to give guidance as we look into Q4 around termination fees, et cetera, or license fees. But that being said, we have historically performed well from a license fee standpoint in the fourth quarter compared to previous quarters. We continue to have a good pipeline there. We have to sell to a number of different financial institutions, but we're confident we're going to hit our guidance for the full year as we've laid out.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And -- yes, that's helpful. And just in terms of margin expansion also, so you've guided to -- 30 to 60 basis points. And any color on where it could lie? I understand it's a small range, but any color there on the expectations where it could lie?","Thomas J. Hirsch","No. It's -- we feel comfortable with that range and for the full year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this afternoon. We apologize for the technical difficulties. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations group. Have a good afternoon.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Stephanie Gregor","Thank you and good afternoon.","With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives.

And also we're pleased to announce that we will hold our Investor Day on June 16 in New York City.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone.","Very solid performance in the fourth quarter capped off an excellent 2014. We increased our adjusted internal revenue growth by 150 basis points, recorded our 29th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and delivered record levels of both sales and free cash flow per share.","We're pleased with our accomplishments for the year. We enter 2015 with momentum and focus. We intend to deliver strong results, which we expect will include our fourth straight year of increasing our adjusted internal revenue growth rate.","However, before we fully define expectations for 2015, let me recap some highlights for the quarter and the year. At the outset of 2014, we communicated three key priorities to help you gauge our progress for the year.","First to continue building high quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings commitments. Second, extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions and third to deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients.","One of our key objectives is to increase our internal revenue growth rate annually and 2014 was no exception. Our adjusted internal revenue growth rate was up more than 150 basis points to 4.3% for the year. These results also include a negative currency impact in the fourth quarter, which prevented us from being at the top end our full year internal revenue growth guidance.","Adjusted internal revenue was up 4% in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was up 13% in the quarter and for the full year, also increased 13% to $3.37. Importantly, adjusted operating margin for 2014 was up more than 50 basis points, consistent with our goal of delivering high quality revenue growth.","Free cash flow performance was stellar at $965 million for the year, which does not include $110 million of dividend distributions from our StoneRiver investment. Combining our well defined capital allocation strategy, with strong cash flow generation, resulted in a 15% increase in free cash flow per share to a record $3.82 for the year.","To that end, we allocated nearly $1.2 billion to share repurchase in 2014, which reduced our comparative share count by 6% at December 31. Our second priority was extending market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions.","On that front, we closed seven DNA sales in the quarter, 26 for the full year and have now added 57 new clients since the acquisition in 2013. The DNA platform is highly attractive for progressive institutions looking for real time straight-through processing, modern architecture and have a desire to look to deliver new value in a data centric world.","Only 15 DNA clients went live in 2014 and we expect that number to more than double in 2015. In addition, integrated sales for open solutions continues to perform beyond our initial revenue synergy estimates with $40 million in 2014 and $60 million cumulative since the 2013 acquisition.","We continue to ride the digital wave adding nearly 400 new mobility clients in 2014. We now have over 14 million mobile users and importantly, grew the mobility ASP community by more than 60% for the year to nearly three million subscribers.","We also went live with our mobility business solution in the quarter and are seeing strong demand for our mobile enabled commercial capabilities.","Sales for our market-leading digital payment solutions were strong in the quarter as well. With 109 signings, Q4 was our strongest bill payment sales quarter since 2012 and we added a total of 356 new clients for the year. We also added over 300 financial institutions to the Popmoney network.","We have a strong digital payment presence at many of the largest financial institutions in the country. As an example Citizens Bank, a $131 billion financial institution renewed its agreement with Fiserv for multiple digital payment capabilities, signing a seven-year extension for CheckFree RXP, Popmoney and TransferNow along with small business versions of each of these services.","Our third priority was to deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients. During the quarter, we launched NOW from Fiserv. NOW are the Network For Our World, is designed to enable payments beyond the point of sale to move with intelligence at the speed of the user's choice.","We believe this capability will translate to meaningful value for financial institutions and their customers. We recently extended our bill payment, account to account transfer and P2P relationship with U.S. Bank and are working closely with them as they provide their customers with a differentiated payment experience, based on several factors including differentiated transaction pricing and payment speed flexibility.","We're excited about the extension of our relationship and the opportunity to help U.S. Bank and the financial industry transform the more than 55 billion payments that occur beyond the point of sale each year.","Real time money movement is top of mind in the U.S. and around the world. Given our suite of solutions, we see multiple opportunities for Fiserv to play a role in this payments transformation.","We were proud to have been selected by Swift to help build the infrastructure of the New Payments Platform or NPP for Australia. This is an expensive project whereby Swift and Fiserv will provide fast, flexible and data rich payments infrastructure to the country.","This project was a key competitive win against a broad set of IT companies and a testament to the strength of our payments capabilities. We're also seeing strong interest and agility, our new cloud based account processing solution in the U.K. Demand is high and structures across a far broader range of institutions than we originally anticipated.","We expect to continue investing in this platform in 2015 as our first clients go live late this year.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results.","Tom Hirsch","Thanks Jeff and good afternoon, everyone.","As you heard upfront, we executed well in the quarter and our results for the year were excellent. Adjusted revenue for the quarter and full year increased 4% to $1.2 billion and $4.7 billion respectively. Adjusted internal revenue growth was also 4% in the fourth quarter, which includes a negative currency impact of 40 basis points.","For the full year, our adjusted internal revenue growth was over 4%, increasing a 150 basis points compared to the 3% growth reported last year. adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89 and for the full year was $3.37, both increasing 13% over the prior periods, coming at the top end of our EPS guidance range for the year.","Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points to 30.6%, and for the year was up 52 basis points to 30.5% driven by high quality revenue growth along with our continued focus on operational efficiency.","We're particularly pleased with our payment segment performance, delivering 6% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter and 7% for the full year, accelerating 200 basis points over the prior year.","Performance in this $2.4 billion revenue segment, was strong across a majority of the businesses including card solutions, channels, bill payment and output solutions.","As you will recall, biller headwinds were a drag at our revenue growth this year, which will annualize in the first half of 2015. Debit transaction growth was 12% in the quarter and 11% for the year. These strong results are a combination of above market transaction growth in our client base, along with the impact of continuing strong sales.","We signed 38 new clients in the quarter and 134 for the year. We remained focus on enabling our clients to be at the forefront of the dynamic card payments landscape. Accordingly, we expect areas such as EMV and tokenization to spur meaningful, new revenue over the next several years.","Payment segment adjusted operating income was excellent, up 10% in the quarter to $202 million and for the year increased 9% to $768 million. We had another quarter of strong adjusted operating margin performance increasing 120 basis points to 32.1% and for the full year, segment operating margin was up 70 basis points to 31.7%.","Growth in the high quality payments revenue is fueling margin expansion, which we expect will continue into the foreseeable future.","Adjusted revenue in the financial segment increased 2% in both the quarter and the year to 610 million and $2.4 billion respectively. Full year adjusted internal revenue growth in the financial segment was 2% up 120 basis points over the prior year.","Growth in this segment was led by our account processing and lending businesses including strong sales to existing clients and the benefit of DNA implementations. As mentioned earlier, revenue was negatively impacted by currency, which reduced growth in the segment by 50 basis points in the quarter.","Adjusted operating income in the financial segment was $192 million in the quarter, down 8% compared to the prior year's very strong results. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down 300 basis points in the prior year and 130 basis points sequentially.","The margin decrease in the quarter was driven primarily by three factors. First, our results were compared to a record operating margin performance in the prior year. Second, we had a 100 basis points of negative impact due to the timing and level of variable compensation.","And finally, we experienced a 150 basis points of negative impact from our international operations, due to several factors including revenue mix and investments in our new agility solution.","For the full year adjusted operating income in the segment was up 2% to $773 million and segment margin was flat at 32.6%. Corporate segment net operating performance in the quarter improved $6 million sequentially and was $12 million better than the prior year. ","This improvement was primarily driven by lower consulting and legal cost along with higher prior year expenses due to the implementation of a new HR system. Our effective adjusted tax rate was 35% in the quarter and 34% for the full year.","Both the quarter and year-to-date rates were 80 basis points lower than their respective prior year periods, primarily due to the street tax benefits recorded in 2014.","We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be up approximately a 100 basis points to 35% in 2015 which will have about a $0.05 to $0.06 negative impact and adjusted EPS for this year.","We also expect a substantial majority of that impact to occur in the first quarter due to a 30% comparable adjusted tax rate.","We received $110 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2014, which are excluded from both free cash flow and adjusted EPS. The joint venture has made significant progress effectively and profitably, monetizing the businesses through disposition.","As a result, our adjusted equity earnings from this investment, excluding transaction gains is down about $0.03 per share from the prior year. We anticipate 2015 adjusted equity earnings to also be down sequentially.","We generated a record $965 million of free cash flow in 2014 and an exceptional 15% increase in free cash flow per share to $3.82. Our results were meaningfully higher than expected due to the timing of several working capital items, which positively impacted free cash flow for the year. This strong result is even more impressively considering the 20% free cash flow per share growth in 2013.","Our focus on high quality revenue and disciplined capital allocation continuous to produce excellent free cash flow per share results. Total debt at year end was $3.8 billion or 2.2 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, which is well within our target leverage ratio.","We repurchased $5.4 million shares of stock in the quarter for $369 million. For the year we\u2019ve returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders, repurchasing $18.7 million shares in 2014 at an average cost of approximately $62 per share.","We announced the new $20 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter and at year end had 19.8 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.","With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks Tom. Sales were 120% of quota for the quarter and we attained 106% of the quota for the year. Strong results in card solutions, digital channels, lending and account processing led the way to a record 2014 performance.","Actual sales were up 7% in the quarter and 12% for the year. We feel good about our sales performance and expect our momentum to continue.","We had $89 million of integrated sales in the quarter and finished the year up 7% to $260 million. Clients have maintained a keen focus on solutions such as card solutions, bill payment, mobility and source capture.","As I mentioned upfront, results within the open solutions client base are very strong nearly doubling integrated sales year-over-year. We\u2019ve achieved operational effectiveness savings at $70 million in 2014 or 117% of our $60 million goal. Savings this year were driven by strong procurement results and open solutions synergies.","We continue to see substantial opportunities to drive efficiency, particularly across our data center and real estate footprint. We plan to accelerate our execution this year in a manner that should provide meaningful operational effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond.","The banking sector firm during the year with only seven regulatory actions in the quarter, it was down meaningfully over the last two years. M&A activity picked up during the year and we expect that trend to continue.","We also saw some improvement in spending patterns compared to the last few years, which we believe will moderately extend 2015. Financial intuitions are focusing their technology spend on solutions that generate revenue, enhance the customer experience, deal with regulatory compliance and drive operational efficiency.","Payments are getting the majority of the industry Inc right now with area such as Apple Pay, tokenization and systemic real time money movement capabilities at the forefront of the discussion.","We are well suited partner with our clients in the evolving payments arena. With that let\u2019s move to 2015.","In addition to financial guidance, we have defined three key enterprise priorities for the year. First continued to build high quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments. Second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. And third deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients.","Now let\u2019s move to 2015 financial outlook. As we accomplished in 2014, our objectives are to sustainably increase our internal revenue growth rate, expand operating margin and turn that combination into compelling free cash flow per share.","We expect adjusted internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, a strong step up from 4% in 2014. The wider revenue growth range this year considers a number of performance scenarios including among others, the level of EMV card production revenue and currency fluctuation.","We also expect our growth rate to buy as to the second half of the year due to the tougher comparisons in the first half of 2015 and the expected ramp of new revenue throughout the year.","We expect adjusted earnings per share growth for the year of 11% to 14% or a range of $3.73 to $3.83. We also expect that our focus on the combination of high quality revenue and operational effectiveness will again translate to full year adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points.","We estimate our free cash flow per share for 2015 to be at least $4.12 following our very strong 15% per share growth in 2014, incorporating this year's guidance results and an expected three year compound growth and free cash flow per share of 14%. Our operational effectiveness target for 2015 is $50 million and our integrated sales target is $250 million.","Lastly, although we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, we expect the first quarter to be our most difficult comparison for the year given the lower tax rate in 2014's first quarter and that Q1 was by far, our strongest revenue growth quarter last year.","In conclusion, our business model is working and we enter this year with momentum and excitement about the opportunities -- had, we are well positioned to booster our adjusted internal revenue growth led again this year, extend operating margin and deliver value for you our shareholders due to strong cash flow generation and capital allocation.","Lastly, let me thank the more than 21,000 associates to focus their collective energy on delivering value per clients each and every day. It truly our Fiserv\u2019s most important asset. ","With that Tony let\u2019s open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jim Snyder of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jim Snyder","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you could may be start on the DNA wins. I believe you said there was 15 customers that converted in 2014 and just to clarify are you expecting 30 more to convert to revenue in 2015?","And maybe you could possibly size the revenue contribution of those conversions?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah, Jim you got those numbers right. So we have '15 went live and '14 and we expect that to a little bit more than double in 2015 and we wouldn\u2019t be able to size it right now, but clearly that gives us momentum going into '15.","And also keep in mind that those conversions will happen on a ratable basis, not perfectly ratable, but a ratable basis throughout the year and so even the clients that go live in mid year won't even anniversary until 2016. So we expect that momentum to continue into the future.","Mark Ernst","And I think just to add to what Jeff said, Jim is the add-on, the payments revenue etcetera is going to continue to come on as those implementations continue. So that growth will be a nice tailwind over the next several years.","Jim Snyder","That's helpful. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, maybe you could just comment on -- the Fed released the payment monetization road map last week. Can you maybe talk about the opportunity that you have for real-time payments, Popmoney or other real-time transfers, as you go through the next few years?","Do you think that banks are going to be more willing to accelerate their investments in these areas, or do you think maybe that actually makes and take a bit of a more of a wait and see approach on those investments?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah, my take on that Jim is all the discussion around real time is quite positive, in terms of banks thinking about how can we systemically allow those $55 billion payments that don\u2019t occur at point-of-sale to move faster than they do today.","I think most everyone would say that over -- its going to be a number of years until that roadmap is actually comes together and however it ultimately gets settled that it allows in a single way for that, for the real time systemic movements we occur.","And so from our standpoint, we\u2019re having a lots and lots of conversions with intuitions, who want to take advantage of the idea and turn it into opportunities to drive value for their customers, look at opportunities, drive high quality fee revenue and really using Popmoney and bill payment and other app -- transfer applications as a way to enable that kind of payments capability.","So from our perspective, we see it to be positive, ultimately we do think that, that real time changes the nature of how bill payment and P2P specifically work today and that will be important transaction drivers over the next three to five, seven years.","Jim Snyder","Thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Rayna Kumar","Good evening. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Are you seeing DNA gaining share specifically from Symitar and the large credit union space?","Jeff Yabuki","Rayna what we're really seeing is that institutions who are really looking for opportunities to modernize their infrastructure to use data in a way that is different than historically has happened in the account processing or in the core processing engines are looking at this, at this technology as an opportunity. We see that happening in the bank spaces as well as in the credit union space.","Rayna Kumar","Got it. Can you quantify your expected operating margin expansion between the payments and financial segment for 2015 and just talk a little bit about the drivers?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah, we one of the things that, that we don\u2019t do as we don\u2019t give segments, segment margin guidance and the reason why we don\u2019t do it is we\u2019re going to see at different times and in different places. ","We\u2019re going to have opportunities to invest, we\u2019re going to see different performance across business lines, you\u2019re going to have changes and comparability and lots of different factors that will have an impact your credit variability within the segments.","And from our standpoint, we\u2019re really operating the company to deliver at least 50 basis points of margin at the company level and that will come from a combination of new growth and existing changes and existing revenue scale, operational effectiveness and the like, so from our perspective it\u2019s hard to sit here right now and say that we will have room in one segment or another, we do have a high degree of confidence that will see margin grow.","And certainly in 2015 by at least 50 basis points is the guidance that we talked about as well as our longer term outlook.","Mark Ernst","Yes, I'll just give a little bit more clarity there, a bit more detail around the segments. On the payment side, clearly we had a very strong year and we\u2019re operating at good scale and why those operations continued to grow those very well.","Financial was, as you well know was flat on a year-over-year basis. We clearly have a few things going on there we really have some difficult international comparisons that we\u2019re also investing as Jeff highlighted in our GLD platform during the year.","We\u2019ve also ramped up a lot of resources in our DNA business around implementation and development. And we also had a couple of small product lines consolidation.","So we have expanded margins in that segment about 200 basis points over the last three years and were confidence. As we look into the future, we\u2019re going to continue to expand margins in that segment, but as Jeff indicated you\u2019re going to have different puts and takes in these segments as we go through future years also.","Rayna Kumar","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Can you just talk a little bit the size of your M&A pipeline and the businesses you are interested in acquiring.","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah, I mean we wouldn\u2019t -- we wouldn\u2019t make any comments about the specifics of the pipeline, but I will say that we are focused on, on looking in areas to deploy from an acquisition perspective where we can increase the level of competitive differentiation and businesses where we have scale positions and we have opportunities.","And we have a interest in the payments and channels area because we think that\u2019s an important area for clients, that we think there are important growth drivers moving forward of course anything we do from an acquisition perspective, we always going to tie a back to our tradeoffs again share repurchase.","But there is obviously a lot of activity in that market and we\u2019re active and looking at that activity. We're actively looking at what\u2019s out there, just make sure we understand what\u2019s going on in the market at any point in time.","Rayna Kumar","Okay. One quick final question for me. If you can just quantify the term fees in the fourth quarter and compared that to the term fees from the -- from the year ago quarter.","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah, there were about flat, compared to the prior year.","Rayna Kumar","Thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Koning of Baird. Your line is open.","David Koning","Hey guys. Great job again. You'll have to split your stock soon again.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks Dave.","David Koning","No, that\u2019s good. So just on the Payments segment, great acceleration through the year. In the context even of the bill pay transactions and debit transactions decelerating just a touch, is that due to a mix shift towards a little maybe smaller bank transactions that yield higher, or maybe you can just give us a little context why revenue accelerated while those had a little bit of deceleration?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah, I think overall from a revenue standpoint we\u2019ve had some very good growth in payments really across the Board. When you look at our channels, our bill payment, which had a lot of new wins and our output solutions and we just really, you don\u2019t have a great year there.","We\u2019re building a lot recurring revenue. And our debit processing business continues to perform really exceptionally from a standpoint of growth and I think our fourth quarter transaction growth in debt, there was actually a little bit higher than the, the other quarters at 12% and the full year was 11%.","So combination of new wins, lot of integrated sales activities along with the DNA etcetera and those wins are helping that offering that we have with our integrated bill payment and debit etcetera.","So we have good momentum there, we have a little headwind in the current year and our Biller business that\u2019s going to extended the first half of next year but outside of that we have overall good momentum.","Mark Ernst","And the other thing I would say Dave is, is we\u2019re also have had some level of success in adding revenue in our -- specifically in our bill payment business, which is not purely transactionally based any more.","So we\u2019re changing that mix a little bit and the other thing that\u2019s happened over the last, call at the last three, four, five years is the bill payment business itself is become a smaller and smaller part of the payment segment.","So yes, the business are growing, but if you think back the check-free days obviously the bill payment business was everything. It\u2019s become a lesser element of the segment. So the correlation to transaction growth isn\u2019t just pure is it as it once was.","David Koning","Got you. Okay and just I guess my follow up, when you\u2019re guiding to 5% to 6% internal growth, that\u2019s reported number, I\u2019m assuming and just wondering what FX headwind is kind of built in there.","Mark Ernst","Yeah it is a reported number. We don\u2019t report on a constant currency basis. So we\u2019ve assumed that there will be negative input from currency. ","We have a variety of different scenarios and which we've worked into our analysis and it's one of the reasons why the range is a bit wider this year than when we entered 2014. So we expect currency to be down.","I don\u2019t think any of us have a perfect crystal ball on where it's going to land, but we do expect it to wait us down, but it is incorporated into our guidance for the year.","Tom Hirsch","And I think Dave, the impact that we highlight on the call was about 40 basis points in the quarter, about 20 basis points for the year. So we expect '15 to be greater than that clearly, but as Jeff indicated, we\u2019ve incorporate range into our broader guidance.","David Koning","Okay. Great. Thanks. Good job.","Jeff Yabuki","So it's going to be a bigger heading than we had in '14.","David Koning","Yeah. Great. Thanks.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ramsey El-Assal","Hi, guys I have a couple of questions on EMV, you mentioned at the timing of EMV adoption is kind of the key variable revenue driver in 2015, kind seems like a split is developing between large banks that are reassuring that card portfolios.","Small banks maybe your customers have seem to be putting it off; I guess A, is it a fair characterization and B, does it imply that at some point you get a real kind of true up and sort of more rapid migration in your base as occurring now?","Mark Ernst","Yeah hey Ramsey, this is Mark Ernst. Let me take that. The split that we see primarily is first and foremost between credit and debit. So, what you\u2019ve heard principally from the larger banks is -- are those banks that have a large credit portfolio.","And they\u2019re reissuing early run credit and that\u2019s really because of some technical issues, which I think you\u2019re familiar with around kind of clarifying the debit rules as related to debit. The indications that we can see are that people are now getting kind of serious about getting reissuance cycle started with debit.","We think that that will push into the second or really kind of take hold now in the second half of 2015. Indications that we can see out of our client base would say that they are kind of behaving or expecting to reissue in much the way that I think the larger banks have indicated they\u2019re on debit as well.","Jeff Yabuki","I think the other thing to consider is that within our business we have, we do card production for our debit clients and we also do card production for a broad range of clients, who are now within our debit processing footprint. So we have a broader range of clients and we serve only in the debit processing business.","But clearly it\u2019s again one of the reasons why our range is larger this year is as we don\u2019t have perfect estimate of how that\u2019s going to lay in. We think it\u2019s an important opportunity that will benefit Fiserv for the next several years. And so obviously we\u2019ll know more as we progress over 2015, but we feel good about that opportunity overall.","Ramsey El-Assal","And just a quick follow-up on that the EMV kind of topic, how do we -- so you give just a little color now in terms of quantifying the size of that opportunity I mean do you handle pretty much all the card printing for your bank customers?","I understand now you have new customers outside just the bank footprint, but is it something where we can say there\u2019s a price of any EMV card and we're multiplying it by effectively every debit card issued in that Fiserv family of customers or is it more nuance to that, there is some outsourcing, there is some puts and takes or?","Mark Ernst","Yes, again it's a bit more nuance than that. In general we know all those numbers and we can kind of model different scenarios. But the other kind of wild card and all this is to what degree some institutions will choose to stay with mag stripe only as a cost matter and accept the fraud risk once the conversion date occurs.","So there\u2019s a number that kind of puts and takes in there and I think different institutions are looking at that risk in different ways.","Jeff Yabuki","And Ramsey, I would say one of the key topics that we\u2019ll discuss at our June Investor Day is in fact EMV and how we see how our model will take that in and what are the kind of the factors that will be considered as this comes in over the next several years.","And clearly it\u2019s important and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to give it sometime in June.","Mark Ernst ","And by June we\u2019ll have much more clarity -- more clarity certainly.","Ramsey El-Assal","Got it. Thanks guys. That\u2019s all for me.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is open.","Chris Shutler","Yes, good afternoon.","Jeff Yabuki","Hi Chris.","Mark Ernst","Hey Chris.","Chris Shutler","So, first on open solutions, just give us a quick update on the -- I think you initially laid out $100 million and $60 million of revenue and cost synergy targets and just how you\u2019re progressing against those?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure, we\u2019re as I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we continue to feel very good about the level of revenue synergies in the open business. We in the middle of last year -- the middle of '13 now, we indicated that we were moving our estimates up, because in fact the receptiveness of the open solutions base to taking the integrated products that we provide have been quite strong and that continued.","We had roughly 20ish million of sales within that grouping in '13 and in another 40 in '15, of which that obviously much of that has not come on yet. It will come on over time and so we see some benefits in that.","And we\u2019ll continue to see opportunities within that base. We typically see in acquisition that it takes two to three years to get our stride from a revenue synergy perspective.","So we began to see in the second half of last year and we think that will continue throughout this year and then early into '16. And we are also seeing some very nice opportunities from the open solutions the open solutions products moving that back into the Fiserv client base as well.","So, very good movement on that front. And then on the cost synergy side, we indicated again this year that a lot of the value that we drove in the operational effectiveness category came from open solutions and so again we feel very good about that and\/or in that case in both cases actually well on track if not ahead of where we anticipated we would be.","Chris Shutler","All right, great and then Jeff, I think you said we had 14 million mobile users versus correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I think you have around 70 million online banking users, at least that's the latest number I have.","Just curious how you're trying to increase adoption amongst the users given that it\u2019s a bit of a new skill set for Fiserv not only just with EFIs but also consumers.","And to what extent your banking and I guess revenue growth and the payment segment over the next several years being driven by your success increasing mobile adoption?","Jeff Yabuki","I have to say this. Banking, no pun intended, right.","Chris Shutler","Exactly Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","It\u2019s a great question. It is again one of the topics in terms of the opportunity to take mobile up to a large degree against that $70 million. Now in fairness, we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll get all $70 million, because some of those $70 million are on the larger platform and some of that -- some of those institutions have adopt mobility some of them have not.","But we do see a much need to grow specifically the ASP subscriber base, which is three million this year. That number is still at a very low level of penetration and we expect to see meaningful growth.","We actually introduced a new program late in 2014, where we\u2019re working with our banking credit union clients to help them drive better adoption in their client base.","The beauty of mobile is the consumers want it and the financial institutions want consumers to use it. And so they\u2019re really looking for ways to drive that together so we have very strong alignment.","So we see that to be a big opportunity and you\u2019ll continue to hear us talk about it and we would expect that over time that will continue to accelerate for us and drive some nice recurring revenue.","Mark Ernst ","The other thing I was going to add to that is to your point about this thing and new skill set to some degree for Fiserv one of the benefits that we have is given the broad range of financial institutions that are using some of these solutions, we now have the opportunity to look across that base of institutions that find those who are performing better versus others and understand a benchmark what they\u2019re doing and bring those best practices out to other clients.","That is proving to be very successful for us so far as we help our clients figure out how to better engage their customers.","Chris Shutler","Make sense. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Condra of BMO Capital Markets.","Paul Condra","Great. Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to ask a little bit about the NOW network that you\u2019ve been speaking about a bit now, but I wondered if could give a little more detail just about what kind of new functionality is going to have or going to be the kind of first users the initial end users.","And then maybe derive some detail about how that rolls on, what\u2019s the expected revenue impact how should we be thinking about it?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure Paul. At a headline level the purpose of the network is to create opportunities to have more data connected to the payments beyond point of sale this is really to focus on the 55 billion payments that happened through the non-POS side of the system.","And so we\u2019re looking at how do we use data? How do we use speed? How do we integrate those capabilities into application such as Bill Payment and Popmoney to allow we think the important convenience aspect of these -- of electronifying in a much faster way these payments.","So we would see this coming in over the next three to five years. An important element of this infrastructure is creating more electronification. Obviously paper payments are only going to move at a certain pace. So one of the things that we are looking at is how do we create a faster and faster electronification. That\u2019s one of the aspects as well.","And over time as we\u2019ve seen institutions today be able to create differentiated pricing around this and we think that\u2019s one of the areas that institutions will use to drive new value. I would say on the call that\u2019s probably about as much as details we can go into, but we\u2019ll talk about this in more depth in June.","Paul Condra","And a follow-up on -- it sounds like you didn\u2019t raise your interest sales target and I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any shift in strategy there or how you get to that number?","Tom Hirsch","Yeah, we didn\u2019t raise it in terms of where we perform this year versus last year, but we do think that the $250 million is an appropriate -- is an appropriate level. We were $250 million in 2014. We delivered $260. Obviously we\u2019re always looking to deliver as much as we can and we think it\u2019s appropriate at this point.","Paul Condra","Thank you. Thanks a lot.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. Can you just provide a bit more color on the financial margin in the quarter and just the moving parts during 2015? I think I know you mentioned earlier that variable comp levels and I think you said it was relative to last year's margin level.","Maybe just Tom if you can give a little more explanation of what the driver was between last years and this year. And then going forward, it\u2019s good to see once again another year of 50 basis points plus of margin expansion for '15.","Is that -- is that a function of mix and scale or are there any cost initiatives? Just can you give us little color on the driving force?","Tom Hirsch","Okay Darrin I\u2019ll start with that one and in the Q4 quarter we had a couple of things one in particularly in the financial segment. First and foremost if you look back at our margin in the fourth quarter last year that\u2019s the highest margin I believe we\u2019ve had ever in that segment, which was a very strong comparison to this quarter.","The second thing as we had timing associated with some variable comp both incentives and commissions, we had a strong sales finish in the quarter in that particular segment. So we expense commissions and we also had some ASIP which was some variable comp which we had expense in the current quarter.","And then the other piece that was about a 100 basis points and then the other piece was international, which I highlighted, which had a revenue mix, it had a very difficult comparison. Also we\u2019ve had this during the year and it also saturated in the fourth quarter.","And then we had some increased spending in our agility platform that came through in the quarter also. So all of those kind of contributed to the Q4 item. As I also highlight on the call our margins in that segment over the past three years are up about 200 basis points.","And clearly as we look forward and you indicated where is the margin driver is going to happen. We\u2019re clearly from the payment segment standpoint at a good place we're executing very well there. Continue to drive incremental revenue in our recurring base solutions like card and bill payment all the rest.","Regarding financial we talked about international, which was a tough compare in the current year. And clearly DNA is an area where we've ramped up a lot of expense and we\u2019re going to be implementing a lot of clients in 2015 and so that scale is starting to return there as we\u2019ve had to put more into development and implementation.","And so we\u2019re confident overall along with our operational effectiveness initiatives. We have a number of those. We're going to be executing on in 2015 that will benefit us in '16 and forward. So those things leaves us much comfort that we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re going to have margin expansion greater than 50 in 2015.","Darrin Peller","Okay. That\u2019s great I was just going to say, when you compare to 2014 with all the investments you made in DNA now they're actually rolling on the vast majority of these clients. I would think there could be even better than 50 basis points now?","Tom Hirsch","We\u2019re going to guide that they\u2019re greater than 50 and we\u2019re highly confident that we\u2019re going to continue to be able to expand margins through our high\u2026","Darrin Peller","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Just one quick follow-up, financials like you said before it was flat growth in '13, it had accelerated to 2% '14. I know you\u2019re not really giving segment level guidance, but these drivers whether it\u2019s DNA or some of the larger clients, should we expect at some point that that growth rate to continue to accelerate or is that a low single-digit grower while payments really drives the engine for your overall top line?","Tom Hirsch","I think we\u2019re going to continue to have -- our payment segment is going to be higher than our financial segment clearly over time, just given the nature of the businesses that are in each segment.","I do think over the longer term, financial segment should continue as we continue to expand our international and to your point, continue to get a lot of revenue from DNA and our other strong market share wins that we've had in the account processing space.","So, I think remember the international stuff does fall into our financial segment and over the next few years we continue to believe we\u2019re going to be growing there and then clearly what the DNA implementations coming on '15 that\u2019s going to also provide an accelerator.","Darrin Peller","Okay. Just last question I\u2019ll turn it to the queue. But on the free cash flow per share growth you guys have always done a great job of not only generating a lot of free cash, but returning it through buybacks and guidance now suggest that continues.","The only question I have is just the free cash flow per share guidance. I think you called for $4.12 if I remember correctly?","Tom Hirsch","At least $4.12.","Darrin Peller","All right. Well I guess what I\u2019m wondering is why that\u2019s sort of a high-single digit growth rate when you are calling for 11% to 14% EPS growth and I think you mentioned earlier some moving parts on working capital, but any more color on that will be great. Thanks guys.","Tom Hirsch","Okay, I think we had -- we significantly outperformed in the current year at $3.82 versus our greater than $3.65 per share guidance. So when we looked at that, we did have some working capital that benefit us this year and some of that is going to reverse as we go forward into '15.","But overall Darren, our compounded annual growth rate of free cash flow per share including '15, '14, and '13 is roughly 14% on a CAGR basis at the $4.12 level and as you know our guidance is greater than $4.12. So again I think you\u2019re going to have some fluctuation in working capital.","But we\u2019ve really from a just a free cash flow per share standpoint have had really some strong results.","Darrin Peller","Okay, great. Thanks guys I appreciate it. Thanks.","Tom Hirsch","Thanks Darrin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great. Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups everything is pretty clean here. Just on the guidance -- the revenue guidance what\u2019s it going to take to get to the 6% adjusted revenue growth? Do you have some large deals that you see or maybe that could ramp to get you there?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah, as you know Tien-tsin, for us it\u2019s difficult to do to get large deals in a year that make a big enough difference that we can have a meaningful impact. The big drivers for us are areas like EMV where we think there is a broad range of scenarios that we could see depending on what happens in the market.","What goes on with currency trends and frankly to get there upper hand you have to have many more things go right than would not I mean we feel good about the range and again. There are some things going on as we talked about that are little bit different in 2015 than we saw in 2014.","But we feel quite confident about where we sit today and it won\u2019t be really sales based, it will be what goes on in the kind of in the market or I am sorry, what goes on within our client base currently.","Tien-tsin Huang","Understood. And then just on FX, I heard those comments on 40 bips in the fourth quarter, but obviously the dollar has strengthened quite a bit, could it be as much as could round up to 1% hit if current rates hold. Just trying to get a sense of where we stand today?","Tom Hirsch","As you know, our revenue is call it 6%, 7% outside. So we have to see I think some pretty negative things to have to be at that level. But we don\u2019t have a crystal ball.","Tien-tsin Huang","Yeah it could be rounding basis points here but, I\u2019ll figure that out. Just one last follow-up if you don\u2019t mind for you Jeff on tokenization, we've been doing a lot of research there. Can you just -- can you get us on Fiserv's role or future role and in a tokenized world? Are you aiming to be a token bulk provider and there\u2019s a lot of definitions around token service provider. So what is Fiserv\u2019s role?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah so I think at this stage we\u2019re looking to play the most important partnering role we can with our clients I\u2019m sure you know as well as I do if not better that there\u2019s lots of evolution going on with kind of the \u201ctoken control\u201d in quotes, right now.","So we do see opportunities there and we actually see opportunities to think about tokenization even more broadly than just on the card size. So when you think about some of these 50 -- kind of how do you move with more speed and alacrity for the 55 billion payment set that are outside a point of sale.","We see some opportunities there as we'll. So I think it\u2019s an evolving topic right now. We are having lots and lots of conversations that would say that our clients would like to see us play an important role there and so we're looking for what's the -- how can we work with the existing provider space to make sure that we\u2019re doing the best thing we can for our clients and also driving as much value as possible on the shareholder side.","Tien-tsin Huang","Yeah, makes sense. Thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens. Your line is open.","Brett Huff","Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay.","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah. Hey Brett.","Brett Huff","How are you guys doing?","Jeff Yabuki","Good. How are you?","Brett Huff","Good. One sort of big picture question and it was kind of hinted at in the last one, if you guys look out three years whatever you are medium-term horizon planning period is, what is the thing that if you could spend more on you\u2019d really pour some gas on the fire, because you think there\u2019s something there. I was thinking like top money maybe in payments.","I\u2019m not sure what the equivalent is in the financial segment. But what is that thing where you think the investment would be -- its big enough that you really think you\u2019d want to do more if you could?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah I would say this entire space outside a point of sale -- this $55 billion payments, which includes everything from person to person, to account to account, to business to business, small business to consumer, consumer to small business.","That space I really think about as the last horizon of payments and the opportunity for us to work with financial institutions to ensure that non-FIs don\u2019t come in and take over that space. It\u2019s as you know, it\u2019s a highly competitive world out there.","And there are lots and lots of providers trying to scrape away pieces of that value chain. So we\u2019re looking to both protect that value chain, but more importantly protect it by adding differentiated value. So if I lived in a non-constrained resource world, I would think that would be one of the biggest areas that I would focus on.","And I think the other big opportunity out there is on the lending side of the equation. I think we\u2019re going to see over the next call it two to three years, three to five years a lot of movement on the lending side, both in terms of financial institutions looking for ways to make more money in both decisioning as well as in terms of the types of loans that are able to be made so basically through new product.","So we see that to be a big opportunity. And then thinking about how can you use the data to enhance those kinds of decisions both in terms of origination as well as on the servicing side. So those are two areas that are at least quite interesting to us as we think about where the world will go over time.","And clearly we are investing in those kinds of areas, but we\u2019re not doing it in an unconstrained way. We\u2019re doing in a responsible way so that we can continue to drive high-quality revenue to make sure that, that we can meet our margin commitments at the same time.","Brett Huff","That makes sense. And as a follow-up, on bill pay you mentioned that your -- it sounds like the business model maybe evolving a little bit -- it\u2019s not as purely tied to a per trend basis maybe. Is there a -- first of all make sure I understand that right.","And second of all, is there a world in which Bill Pay stops being as a per trend revenue and becomes more, I don\u2019t know not inclusive or whatever more bundled or even a license arrangement, is that a foreseeable outcome\/","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah so Brett, I would say that we do see a variety of different ways in which we\u2019re driving value in the bill payment business. Some of it has to do with services customization. So the ability to allow financial institutions to design experiences that make the most sense for their customers. One of things that we talked about is that spend focus is really big time around customer experience.","And you know well the traditional killer app in the digital world has been bill payment. So the ability to provide bill payment services and allow institutions to consume that the way they want to certainly one of the opportunity is out there and so we\u2019ve had an opportunity to create some additional streams of revenue in that space.","You\u2019ve got some add-on transactional opportunities whether it\u2019s around risk management e-bill those kinds of things. And then there\u2019s another emerging category which really ties into this whole notion of systemic real-time and that is premium transaction.","So allowing financial institutions to use our capabilities on the front end so whether there be bill payment, P2P, or account to account transfer linking that to real-time and then charging consumers a reasonable fee that, that they can -- so that they will avail themselves of that real time capability want to make sense for their own situation. ","So add all those up and we do see a time where different kinds of transactions get monetized differently and I think we\u2019ve talked about the fact that, that there may be and there may be some point where, where slower transactions are priced differently relative to the more quote premium or faster transactions.","And so we are looking at different pricing model then different ways to make sure that we find that balance between what consumers, financial institutions and what we need. ","But I will say, the only thing I would say is I don\u2019t see as moving to a licensed kind of a model, I see this continuing to be a cloud based an ASP solution because there is a network effect that\u2019s very important and we need to continue to build that network out so that we can have the highest percentage of electronic transactions possible which is, which is absolutely paramount when you talk about driving real time transaction.","So it is an evolving space. We\u2019re actually quite excited about this evolution and believe that we are extremely well positioned to lead that over the next three, five, seven years.","Brett Huff","That\u2019s really helpful. And then just last quick one, did you guys talk a little bit about the tenure of what you think the deployment of the REPO authorization might be this year.","Jeff Yabuk","Kind of how, how -- we did not give any guidance to how we move through the, the remaining shares. ","Brett Huff","Okay. Thank you, appreciated.","Jeff Yabuk","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Glenn Greene","Thanks and thanks for squeezing me in. Couple of quick question, just first on the sales growth another good year, the 12% year-over-year, may be Jeff said, at a high level the two or three key drivers of that?","And then also just to clarify are the open solution sales results includes in that or that\u2019s sort of a separate metric and then what directionally would be the increase in the quarter for \u201915.","Jeff Yabuk","So, I would say Glenn that, that easy answer is open, the open solutions, the old open solutions business is included in there and it was included in that on an actual basis, it was included in the prior year as well.","So it\u2019s an apples-to-apples comparison. The big drivers in the sales results for the year are going to around our account processing platforms. We had some nice wins across most of our platforms in 2014.","In terms of DNA, but also around premiere signature position, clear touch, we\u2019ve had good success because the beauty of our product set is that we don\u2019t think there is one size that\u2019s all, we know that different institutions want different solutions. ","So, the account processing business is did well, our lending business had a very good year, very happy with the work there, our risk solution, our risk area had a good year as well and in fact everyone had a good year card solutions did very well. ","We mentioned that our fourth quarter bill payments results were the highest that we had since 2012, so really across the board and I think it is a matter of having products that are appealing to clients on the accounts processing side where we have a good strong integrated value proposition because we\u2019re delivering products that are universally taken across the entire landscape from the largest clients through some of the smaller community banks.","So that\u2019s worked out well and we expect that to continue into this year. Lastly we don\u2019t -- we wouldn\u2019t talk about the number and quote but I will say, I think this is our third year in a row that we would say we had record sales and we\u2019re continuing to be in a place where we expect from the basis of the investments that we make to continue to be able to drive, to drive increased sales. ","Part of that comes from being better with our existing clients and part of it comes from delivering some new products into the market. We indicated that we went live with our mobility for business, which is our commercial -- our commercial mobile solution.","And that we expect to drive across hundreds of financial institutions over the next several years, so again it\u2019s a combination of continuing to have the best sales force and also introducing new products.","Glenn Greene","Okay. And then for Tom on the FX, Jeff I think mentioned that international was 6% to 7% of revenue, is that roughly evenly split between your euro and the Aussie dollar? Just so the conservative modeling can think about it?","Tom Hirsch","I don't know if that's evenly split and I can get back to you offline on that one. I think it's probably a combination of both and a few other smaller one. So that's how we put and I would say. We're as I highlighted 40 basis points in the quarter, 20 basis points for the year and we expect that to be bigger in '15 from a headwind standpoint.","Glenn Greene","And then just real quick on the decrease in the year-over-year corporate cost, I thought I heard you say something about lower incentive comp, which I didn't fully understand why that would be.","Tom Hirsch","No, no, not on the, I said lower consulting and legal cost and then in the prior year when we had an implementation of a new HR system which we have a lot of expense associated with.","Glenn Greene","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Kartik Mehta. Your line is open of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta","Thanks. Jeff, you talked about gaining market share on the bill payment side, I am wondering is the competitive environment changing or what are the drivers that for you to be able to gain that market share?","Jeff Yabuki","I think what we said is we had our strongest sales quarter in the fourth quarter since 2012 when we had somewhere north of 300 wins for the year, which is pretty consistent with what we've seen going for the last several years. So I would say its two fold.","It is first and foremost having what we believe is the best solution in the market and that's especially important as speed becomes more and more important to consumer. So the ability to link up the certainly the -- again we think is the best product in the market with some of our solutions such as PEP+ which are going to help today enable real time.","And they've got a big opportunity and a big differentiator and then secondly, the continuing ability to deliver that into our account processing base, which a you know is somewhere in the area of 5,000 financial institutions. So is really the combination of those two that's creating the success.","Kartik Mehta","And then just a question Jeff may be a business that's been forgotten or not talked about, the check processing business and as you see checks declined, are there opportunities for you out there and our client base or outside your client base to when that business and potentially help the check processing business these banks come under pressure as their volumes are declining?","Jeff Yabuki","The theoretic answer is yes. I would say that over time, there have been several different junctures where we believed that given the financial pressures that there would be motivation to outsource that solution.","And today, we've had discussions, but we frankly haven't seen a lot of movement in that space and I am sure there are a variety of reasons why, but for now, we certainly are counting on that happening when we think about forward revenue growth.","If it happens that's great, but it's certainly in our part it's not an important part of our growth formula moving forward.","Kartik Mehta","And then Jeff, just a last question, any benefits or hurdles from the regulator environment that could help you grow revenue or when additional market share from others?","Jeff Yabuki","I there is a general -- there is a general quote \u201cbenefit in the market\u201d because of the level of regulatory scrutiny and pressure, which is causing institutions to take a good look at how they spend and are they getting the most or they getting the optimal value for that spend.","I would say that's a more systemic benefit and that the providers themselves are generally equal on that front.","Mark Ernst","There probably are a few of our product lines that are disproportionally benefitting from the regulatory pressure. We talked about the opportunity in lending, which has a strong kind of regulatory under current to the changes that we've seen in that market.","Kartik Mehta","All right, thanks Mark; thanks Jeff. Appreciate it.","Jeff Yabuki","Absolutely. Thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. I know we went a little bit longer than we typically do, but we appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our investor relations team. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's call.

Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone.","Fourth quarter results were excellent across the board and contributed to us meeting each of our financial objectives for the year. Internal revenue growth in the quarter rebounded to its highest level in several years at 6%, with strong performance in both segments. Sales increased 14% sequentially and quota attainment was 100% for the quarter.","The performance in the quarter led to a 22% increase in adjusted earnings per share, capping our 32nd consecutive year of double-digit growth. Nearly as impressive is that in 30 of the 32 years we have been a public company, our stock has provided a positive return to shareholders, further demonstrating the underlying growth and resilience of our business model.","Our financial outlook for 2018 includes acceleration in internal revenue growth, substantial adjusted earnings per share growth, further buoyed by the tax reform passed last year; expanding adjusted operating margin and strong free cash flow. Our 2018 guidance also incorporates some incremental investments we are choosing to make as a result of the tax law changes, which we will discuss later in this call.","2017 internal revenue growth was 4%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points, which includes margin dilution from in-year acquisitions; and importantly, free cash flow crossed $1.2 billion for the first time.","Earlier today, we announced the signing of an agreement to sell a majority share of our Lending Solutions business to Warburg Pincus LLC. This business has been primarily focused on auto loan origination, lease management, and high-volume mortgage servicing.","As you may recall, we formed a similar structure with our StoneRiver venture in 2008, which provided outstanding returns for our collective shareholders. We believe Warburg Pincus is the right partner to take advantage of the growth and value-creation opportunities in this business.","A very important part of our strategic platform is ensuring we have the right mix of businesses to deliver superior value for both clients and shareholders. Over the last year, we divested a few smaller businesses and completed four acquisitions \u2013 all with an eye towards increasing differentiation, adding to our growth quotient and enhancing value creation.","Now let's review our progress in 2017 against our key shareholder priorities, which were: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.","A primary focus of our business is to continue to add high-quality revenue. Our internal revenue growth accelerated to 6% in the quarter, driven by strong performance across multiple business lines, including a rebound in periodic revenue from Q3.","Internal revenue growth was on the lower end of our full year guidance at 4%. Adjusted operating margin was up 60 basis points for 2017, and is our sixth consecutive year of expansion. Adjusted EPS finished near the top of our original guidance range, up 16% for the year to $5.12, and free cash flow was excellent, up 13%. We are pleased to have met our financial commitments for the year and are well-positioned to going into 2018 and beyond.","Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. DNA, which we acquired in 2013, had another very strong year with signings growing more than 30%. And within that, we nearly doubled the number of institutions signed with assets greater than $1 billion.","We expect to see increased revenue from DNA in the related solutions in 2018, and to further penetrate the most attractive segments of the market. For example, we signed Sallie Mae Bank, a $21 billion asset institution, in the quarter to implement a DNA-led digital bundle, including Architect and our leading payment solutions. The bank chose Fiserv and DNA because of its modern architecture, flexible user interface, and superior digital capabilities. Architect, our multichannel digital platform acquired in 2016, has made strong inroads in a market that is increasingly looking for a flexible, integrated solution for both online and mobile banking that serves all types of users \u2013 retail, small business, and commercial.","Our platform, combined with market-leading payment solutions, has us very well-positioned to ride the evolving digital wave. As proof points, the number of Architect sales increased over 300% compared to 2016.","We were pleased to expand our relationship with Fidelity Bank with $4.5 billion in assets in the quarter. The bank selected Architect and CheckFree RXP to enhance its digital offering because of our robust features and depth of solution integration. We also signed Dollar Bank with assets of over $8 billion to a digital bundle headlined by Architect, CheckFree RXP, and our turnkey Zelle solution. We were again chosen to enable digital transformation due to superior technology and integration.","We grew our Mobiliti ASP subscribers 24% to 6.8 million subscribers for the year. Mobiliti business also continued its growth trajectory as subscribers grew nearly 75% for the year and the number of live clients was up nearly 60%.","In addition, subscribers on the Architect integrated platform grew nearly 40% for the year. We expect strong growth as mobile continues its journey to become the preferred interaction channel for depository institutions and their customers.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. The Zelle P2P network launched in June with Fiserv as a key partner to enable both large and small financial institutions. During the quarter, we continued to sign larger institutions to our turnkey Zelle solution, including Comerica Bank with $72 billion in assets.","In addition, SunTrust, Citizens Bank and Ally Bank, each went live in the quarter, contributing to a 90% increase in sequential Zelle transactions. The market enthusiasm we are seeing with Zelle, along with a ramp in advertising across multiple media channels, is supporting our optimism about the size and the scope of our role in this emerging payments opportunity.","We continue to expand our portfolio of innovative solutions during the year, completing four acquisitions in areas of strategic importance such as payments and digital enablement. Early in 2017, we closed on the acquisition of Online Banking Solutions with its award-winning digital banking product, Commercial Center.","During the year, we signed more than 20 institutions to this high-end solution, nearly four times the prior year, and a seven-fold increase in total contract value. Commercial Center users increased 38% over the prior year, and like Architect, should grow substantially in 2018.","We acquired Dovetail in the third quarter to provide our clients with market-leading transformational payments technology and real-time capabilities. We're off to a strong start, signing two of the top 25 banks in the quarter, Citizens Bank and KeyBanc, to the Dovetail real-time payment solution. We're seeing strong demand for these services in the U.S., which is adding to our forward optimism.","And finally, for the fifth year in a row, we remained one of FORTUNE Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. We're also one of roughly 200 businesses to achieve this honor, along with being included in the FORTUNE 500.","Now with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.","Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 7% to $1.4 billion and increased 4% to $5.4 billion for the full year. Internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter was led by strong performance across both of our reporting segments, including the timing benefit of periodic revenue shortfall from Q3.","Adjusted earnings per share grew a very strong 22% to $1.41 in the quarter and increased 16% for the year to $5.12. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 190 basis points to 34.0%, due primarily to strong Q4 revenue growth and mix. Our full year adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to a new full year high watermark of 32.8%.","Our strong results were driven primarily by Payments segment growth, business mix and a continued focus on operational effectiveness, partially offset by a 30 basis point headwind from in-year acquisitions. We are well positioned to continue expanding operating margin through high-quality revenue growth, operational effectiveness benefits and growing our newer acquisition-based solutions.","The Payments segment delivered internal revenue growth of 7% for the quarter and 5% for the year. Performance in the quarter was led by strong results from our Card Services and Electronic Payments businesses. Adjusted revenue, which includes the impact of our acquired businesses, grew 9% in the quarter to $792 million and 6% for the full year to $3 billion.","Debit transaction growth for the year was in the mid-single digits; and with only a minimal current year benefit from Zelle, P2P transactions grew more than 20%. Mobile banking continues to be a critical priority for our clients and a growth driver for us.","In 2017, we signed 35 clients to Architect and 160 clients to Mobiliti ASP. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 6% sequentially and 24% for the year to 6.8 million. The Payments segment adjusted operating income increased 20% in the quarter to $288 million, and was up 10% to $1 billion for the full year.","Adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points in the quarter to 36.4%, due primarily to the timing of periodic revenue and growth in our scale revenue businesses.","For the full year, adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 35.1%, which more than offset the 40 basis point headwind from current year acquisitions.","The Financial segment adjusted revenue in the quarter was $668 million, with internal revenue growth of 5%, driven primarily by our account processing and lending businesses, along with an increase in periodic revenue. Internal revenue growth in the segment grew 3% for the year and adjusted segment revenue was $2.5 billion.","Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 8% in the quarter to $235 million and up 3% for the year to $849 million. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter improved 140 basis points to 35.1%, which was our strongest adjusted operating margin quarterly performance of the year.","Full year adjusted operating margin for the segment was up 30 basis points to 33.5%. And margin performance for the quarter and the year was again driven by revenue growth in scale businesses, revenue mix, and operational effectiveness.","Corporate and Other net operating loss came in generally as expected for both the quarter and the full year, consistent with our comments in Q1 of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.8% and the full year was 31.2%. These results were slightly better than our expectations due to the timing of certain discrete tax benefits in the quarter.","(00:14:07) on a GAAP basis, we recognized a $275 million tax benefit, driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act impact on our deferred tax liabilities, which has not been included in our adjusted EPS in the quarter or the year.","As Jeff indicated, we expect a meaningful benefit from tax reform; and accordingly, we currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 22% and 23%. This rate is down significantly from our previously expected long-term rate of 33%, as well as 2017's adjusted effective tax rate of 31.2%. Our new adjusted effective tax rate range includes the expected benefit of the lower headline federal rate, partially offset by reduced tax benefits such as the elimination of Section 199 deduction and a reduced value of state deductions.","As mentioned upfront, we've decided to use this unique opportunity to increase our investments for the next couple of years, which we believe is the best option to maximize long-term shareholder value. We expect these investments to center primarily on client-facing technologies with a focus on service excellence, digital experience, and payments. And at the same time, we will also undertake a holistic view of our employee benefit plans. We expect the majority of these investments to subside over the next 18 to 24 months.","Overall, we estimate that the tax reform savings, net of the new investments, will contribute between $0.55 and $0.63 to our adjusted earnings per share for the year. Our strong business model generated a record $1.2 billion of free cash flow in 2017, up 13% from the prior year. Free cash flow conversion for the year was 111%, the top end of our guidance; once again, demonstrating our focus on turning earnings into free cash flow.","We repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock in the quarter for $189 million, and 9.7 million shares for the year. That translates to $1.2 billion for our shareholders in 2017 and $5 billion over the past four years.","There were 207.6 million shares outstanding at year-end and 10.7 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. Total debt outstanding at the end of the year was $4.9 billion or 2.3 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our targeted leverage ratio. We'll continue to leverage the strength of our balance sheet, combined with excellent free cash flow to create meaningful value for our clients and shareholders.","As Jeff mentioned, we signed an agreement to sell 55% of our Lending Solutions business, which we expect will be slightly dilutive in 2018. We anticipate receiving approximately $395 million of net after-tax proceeds and we'll retain the 45% interest in the new venture.","We anticipate closing the transaction in the first quarter and have incorporated the expected impact into our 2018 guidance.","On a pro forma basis, the adjusted EPS for 2017 should be reduced by $0.16 to $4.96. We also expect this transaction to compress adjusted operating margin by about 50 basis points in 2018, which has been included in our outlook. We believe this transaction and subsequent joint venture is a superior way to maximize the value for our clients, associates and shareholders.","We deployed approximately $385 million to acquisitions during the year, which we believe over time will make important strategic and financial contributions. Along those lines, we've taken steps to streamline the Monitise acquisition, including the divestiture of the retail voucher business, which closed in January. This transaction alone reduces our net Monitise purchase price by roughly 70%.","We've adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition in 2018. And given the nature of our business model, less than 5% of our revenue is impacted by the revenue recognition change. The primary areas of impact are termination fees and a subset of our professional services revenue.","And while we do not expect the new standard to have a meaningful impact on our full year results, we do anticipate increased variability within the quarterly comparisons as the new revenue recognition standard is applied prospectively to our reported results. We've elected to use the modified retrospective transition approach, which will provide you with transparency on the impact of the old and new methodologies each quarter.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Sales performance was 100% of quota in the quarter. For the year, sales were up 3% and at 93% of quota. Domestic sales results were slightly better coming in at 96% of quota against aggressive 2017 targets. Total sales growth has averaged 12% per year for the last two years. And keep in mind, we typically don't include the sales results from in-year acquisitions in our reporting.","We anticipate a step-up in sales for 2018, which is supported by a strong pipeline as we enter the new year. Integrated sales finished well, increasing 34% sequentially to $103 million in the quarter and up 2% to $297 million for the year.","Digital channels, payments and statements continue to be the larger drivers of growth in this important element of our strategy.","Our operational effectiveness results were outstanding, coming in at $82 million for the year, significantly exceeding our $60 million target. After the second year of our five-year plan, we have achieved nearly 60% of the $250 million objective, well ahead of our anticipated pacing.","Savings for the year were led by workforce optimization and procurement. Our data center consolidation has also progressed, closing nearly half of the locations we have targeted to eliminate. Our operational effectiveness target for 2018 is $50 million.","We're seeing continued enthusiasm in the banking market due to a combination of tax reform and rising interest rates. We anticipate financial institutions will use this excess capacity to increase investments in their businesses with a technology focus on payments, cyber security, digital, and data management and utilization. These priorities align quite well with our organic and acquisition-based innovation, and we are well-positioned to benefit from this demand over time.","With that, let's move to 2018.","Our key shareholder priorities will remain substantially similar to the three focused areas tracked in 2017. Financially, we expect our internal revenue growth rate to accelerate to at least 4.5% for the year. Our revenue growth expectations for the year also assume a substantial reduction in termination fee revenue.","Speaking of which, you will recall we had very high periodic revenue in last year's first quarter, which will lead to a difficult compare. Therefore, we expect internal revenue growth to be low in Q1 and that the expected acceleration will begin in the second quarter and build throughout the year.","As we've discussed, we intend to allocate a portion of tax savings to increase our investments and maximize shareholder value over the longer term. Given the combination of these incremental investments, which we anticipate will moderate over the next couple of years and the compression from the sale of the lending business, we expect our adjusted operating margin for the year to increase in a range of 10 to 30 basis points; and for illustration, have included a bridge on page 19 of the accompanying slides.","We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.05 to $6.30 for the year, which is growth of 22% to 27% over the revised 2017 result of $4.96, reflecting the sale of the majority share of the lending business and the net earnings benefit of the tax law changes.","Finally, we expect free cash flow conversion to be in a range of 106% to 111% for the full year.","Given we are investing a portion of this year's tax benefit, we believe it is valuable to provide very early transparency into next year. For clarity, while this is absolutely not 2019 guidance, we believe our adjusted earnings per share growth should be well within our long-term outlook, be at least $7 per share and carry our typical level of free cash flow conversion.","In conclusion, we view 2017 as a year of both progress and new opportunities. While we are pleased that we achieved our financial commitments, we are far more excited about the road ahead. We're proactively shaping our business to stay on the forefront of the trends facing financial technology and most important, to ensure we are the partner of choice for our clients.","At our Investor Day in June, we shared a series of strategies that we believe will allow us to create sustained value for our shareholders and contribute to even stronger performance in 2018. We know our success is a result of the cumulative effort, dedication and accomplishment of our nearly 24,000 associates around the world who are Fiserv proud and come to work each day to make a difference for our clients and shareholders.","Lastly, we announced today that Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer, intends to retire from Fiserv on April 1. Mark joined the company in early 2011 and has been a key part of the executive leadership team. Mark is a strong leader with unparalleled strategic insights and vision. He has made numerous contributions to the company, including recently spearheading the development of a new end-to-end service model, which we believe will transform the way we serve clients.","As some of you know, Mike and I have worked together on and off for the better part of 30 years. It's been a privilege to learn, work and partner with him in the journey to deliver differentiated value to our clients, associates and shareholders. We thank Mark for his many contributions to Fiserv and wish him the best as he moves into this next stage of his life.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys, you crossed it. Great job.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. So I guess, first of all, deferred revenue was up a ton sequentially. It's been in a pretty tight range, kind of around 4.50 (00:25:35) for a while. Is that reflective of all the sales and part of the reason why like that revenue is going to come in in 2018?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Dave, it's Bob. You're absolutely correct. We did see an increase that's part of our annual billing process, and that revenue will materialize over the course of 2018.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, got you. Great. And then I guess, one other thing, the minority interest line, are we going to see something like that now, that 45% is going to fall through there just like StoneRiver used to? And how much about would that be per quarter?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. So you're exactly right. We will see the minority interest from the joint venture begin to flow through there in the first quarter, very similar to what you saw with StoneRiver. We're not ready to forecast out that particular line of income statement, but we will see that throughout 2018.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Dave, part of it depends on closing, timing and things like that. So we'll get better \u2013 a little bit more perspective in Q \u2013 when we report Q1.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you. And the only other thing I had, just buyback thought process, like pretty typical going forward, like nothing's changing a lot with tax reform. We should kind of assume within guidance kind of the normal pace?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. No change in our capital deployment approach, consistent with the last many years.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Sounds great. Thanks, guys.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, is there anything kind of \u2013 any incremental visibility that helped you kind of get comfortable providing that preliminary view of 2019, confidence in the pipeline? Or is that more just sort of a general confidence level about the ongoing solidity of the business?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So it's really a combination. I would say it was for a couple of reasons. As most people know, we operate in a pretty tight range in terms of earnings growth, and we feel good about some of the elements that we think are going to drive additional growth and therefore, profitability, as we deliver \u2013 as we intend to deliver in 2018 and to move into 2019.","But the other piece is we wanted to make sure that shareholders understood that some of the investments that we're making that we \u2013 the incremental investments that we carved out of some of the tax benefits, we do see those investments \u2013 we expect those investments to moderate over the next couple of years. And therefore, we'll have a more normalized growth rate even after having what's our guidance this year, the 22% to 27%.","So we would still expect to be well within our guidance. And we just wanted to make sure we gave a little pathway of visibility to that, again, on top of the fact that we do have an expected level of confidence that we'll see revenue growth start to step up in the way that we have strategically intended it to.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Are there other assets like the lending business that are right for similar treatment? Should we expect incremental divestitures to kind to free up some liquidity over the medium term?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","It's a great question. I will say as part of our strategic process, on a very regular basis, we're taking a look at what is the mix of businesses that we have, how do those businesses compare with not just the macros that we see today but the forward macros. Does it fit well with this integrated \u2013 we talked about this four-corner strategy, where we've got assets that fit into these corners and how do they fit in terms of driving innovation advantages and integration advantages. So we laid that out in Investor Day.","And frankly, as the world evolves, there may be assets that fit today and won't fit tomorrow and assets that we need tomorrow that we'll acquire to make sure that we have the right mix. So as we sit here today, I wouldn't say we have an immediate list of things that we would look to divest but we will continue to monitor that over time.","I think we did the StoneRiver joint venture back in 2008, and this is really the \u2013 we haven't done a larger divestiture since that time. So I don't know that necessarily past performance is indicative of the future, but it's not something that we plan to do on a regular basis.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks so much, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Ramsey.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, and best of luck, Mark.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","As you look out to 2018, how are you thinking about the internal growth rates of Payments versus Financial? You've called out 30% growth in DNA signings in 2017, so I'm curious if you start to benefit from those in 2018, are those more 2019 revenue benefits?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So let me start with it and then, Bob, you can add on as needed. As we have for the last number of years, we would expect to see Payments drive a higher proportion of relative growth in the company. And the signings that are coming \u2013 the signings that we would have made in 2017 would largely benefit second half 2018 and into 2019, again, depending on the timing of the transactions.","But there's not \u2013 we'd be more benefited from the signings frankly in 2016 \u2013 in 2018 than we would the 2017 signings. But we like the momentum a lot. You've, I'm sure, David, picked up the comment that we made about the number of institutions that we've signed, over $1 billion of assets. We're getting really great momentum there in both the bank and the credit union space, and so we're quite excited about the state of the market.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Are you seeing any relative difference in 2018 technology spending intentions between your credit union customer base and your bank customer base?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I would say relative to 2017, no. We have been seeing the bank side of the charters step up their spending where the credit unions had been a little bit more out in front. We're also seeing a lot of interesting activity as it relates to payment hubs on the bank side, where the banks are putting more money into payment modernization, the credit unions have been historically, except for at the very high end of that base. So that's another slight differential.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then operational effectiveness, you exceeded your 2017 target by nearly 40%. It looks like your 2018 target of $50 million is actually about 16% to 17% below your 2017 target. What are the reasons why that target would step down? And is that just a conservative view at this point?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","David, we'll let Bob take that one. Go ahead, Bob.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. So the simple answer is, as you know, it's a five-year program. We just finished year two. We are well ahead of the expected pace through the first two years. We're about $140 million in right now with the $50 million forecast for 2018. We'll be approaching $200 million just three years into the program.","We had some really nice progress in labor optimization and procurement in 2017. Some of that doesn't naturally repeat. We'll continue to see benefits on procurement, data center optimization, real estate into 2018, and that's really the underpinnings of that $50 million forecast.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","David, I would add in there, I mean, in all candor, we've meaningfully outperformed where we thought we would be in the first two years of the program. And so just continuing to make sure that we do this well and that we systemically continue to build up. It's also one of the reasons why we like our visibility going into 2019. We would expect to see continued growth in the operational effectiveness.","The other thing I would say is at our Investor Day, Bob had talked about the fact that he already was foreshadowing another phase. We're quite intrigued at some of the technological advancements that have been made, even in the six months or so since we did Investor Day in AI and RPA. And so we're evaluating those kinds of technologies in a way to both be more efficient, but also deliver a far \u2013 we think, far more effective service to clients. So it's a pretty interesting time in the whole space of operational effectiveness.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you very much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, folks and congratulations, Mark, on your retirement. Well, I guess, let me start with the four acquisitions that you made, I think, in the last just, I think, five months, six months. Can you size them? So what's factored in the guide? And I realized the forward benefits are \u2013 a lot of them are strategic and cross-selling type stuff in nature and micro-services, and all that. But can you size them and kind of lay them out for us, if you don't mind?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Well, let's see if we can get there, Ashwin. The acquisitions that we had been doing, we started the year doing the Online Banking Solutions, which was the acquisition of Commercial Center. We then did the PCLender acquisition. We then did Dovetail, and then I think we closed out the year with Monitise, or maybe it was the other way around, they were pretty close to each other.","Each of those \u2013 each of \u2013 the Dovetail, PCLender and Online Banking Solutions or Commercial Center as we talked about in the script, those technologies are fully solution technologies. They're in the market. We're selling them. We're quite enthusiastic. But remember, the way we calculate internal revenue growth today, the growth that we would have gotten from those solutions, we don't bring in to our internal revenue growth calculation until it's been \u2013 they've been with us for 12 months. And so, there was effectively zero in 2017 from that.","We'll start to get a little bit of it in 2018 from the OBS, the Commercial Center acquisition. And then starting in the fourth quarter, we'll see little bits of the other acquisition start to layer in. So we do have a fair amount of optimism around creating at least a tailwind for internal revenue growth as we move into 2019 through these acquisitions.","For the most part, we are buying businesses that we believe are importantly accretive to our growth rate, have technologies that we believe align very well with our clients and then third that they fit our integrated value proposition that we look to bring to the market.","So from a pure acquisition perspective, they will impact us on the top line very little in 2018. There'll be some bottom-line benefit because, of course, that is not excluded in the calculations, but that the real cumulative contribution will start in 2019. Just like we saw with DNA when we bought that in 2013, we're now seeing very healthy contributions to growth from that. Just illustratively, we would expect it to follow that type of a pacing.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. Anything on the size would also be helpful in terms of revenues. But the other question I had was, the comment on term fees being lower. Was that primarily \u2013 did I understand it correctly, it's driven by ASC 606, or is there some change in the market, where you've kind of done something to have lower term fees, higher win rate, something like that going on? Can you comment on that?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Overall, there's \u2013 as I mentioned in the opening comments, there's very modest, immaterial impact from ASC 606. Term fees are one of the areas but not a significant driver. It really is the market driving the reduced amount of term fees in 2018 over 2017.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Ashwin, part of it is you never \u2013 you don't know exactly what's going to happen from term fees. We are expecting to see lower term fees, actually, meaningfully lower term fees this year. And part of it is valuations. As valuations go up, we see acquisitions go down. We're optimistic based on what we see on the horizon that we'll win more in that space, and therefore term fees will be less. But it's really the balanced assessment of the market and where we are right now.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. And if I could sneak one more in. Other than the 1Q comment that you had, Jeff, any other thoughts on cadence for segment revenues, profits through the year? Anything we should watch out for as we lay out the quarters?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","I mean, the comment Jeff made about Q1 is really driven \u2013 if you recall, Q1 of 2017, we came out of the gate very strong, and so we have some difficult comps, and that was driven by some timing of periodic revenue that doesn't repeat.","And then the other item I pointed out in my opening comments is we'll see some variability on a quarterly flow given the ASC 606. But again, we'll give some good visibility into that as we release earnings on a quarterly basis going forward.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Good job.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Joe? Operator, maybe we should go to the next question.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hello?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Oh, Joe?","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah. Can you hear me? There was a phone, I think, ringing in the background there. Can you hear me now?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","All good.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay, good. I don't know if you guys are getting another call or something, but anyways...","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","It'd better not be us, Joe.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Well, if it's revenue calling, you should answer.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","(00:42:19).","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Exactly. Well, I guess my first question here is you made in your comments earlier, bank IT spending may be was increasing due to maybe some tax reforms and I guess higher interest rates. Do you think you're going to see maybe some more spending in 2018? And if so, how would you think about that flowing through the model?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question, Joe. The comments were really meant to imply that financial institutions, the people making buying decisions are feeling healthier right now. And that they're expanding the aperture \u2013 opening the aperture on what it is they're looking at.","For our purposes, we don't assume a spending environment that is, in any meaningful way, different than 2018 than it was in 2017. I think to the extent that we see the translation to wider exploration to sales to revenue; it's really going to be more of a 2019 impact than it would be an 2018.","But we are optimistic about how \"banking\" feels right now and from their perspective, and their opportunity to maybe spend more on solutions as they move forward. So that is a level of optimism that's more factored into out-years than it would be this year.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And then could you talk a little bit about what the contribution from those digital offerings were in 2017? And maybe what you expect them to contribute in 2018? If you could size that in anyway, that'd be great.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Joe, what kind of \u2013 when you say contribution, what do you mean?","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Either revenue growth or percentages of revenue. I know it's probably hard to peg, but I wanted to see if we can get a sense of how big they were.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. We don't supply that kind of detail. What I would say is, one of the reasons why we've been using our Mobiliti ASP solution, as an example, I think this year we were up 24%. So the \u2013 we're seeing a lot of growth on the digital side. That business has gone from really zero users about five years ago to now nearly 7 million, and we would expect to see strong growth again.","We're getting growth from Architect, now Commercial Center, Zelle, our Notifi product, and so there's a lot going on out there. So digital is becoming a larger and larger part of the company. Now I would say \u2013 I think it's fair to say it's still a relatively small part of the company, but its contribution is growing more and more, and we expect that to continue so long as the world continues to evolve digitally.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And the last one for me, do you expect to return to sort of this 50 to 70 basis points margin expansion in 2019? I know you gave at least a goalpost out there of at least $7. So I'm just wondering, do we return sort of the usual margin expansion in that particular year. Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. Barring something unforeseen that is not within our aperture right now, I would say, we would expect to be back to where we are with our long-term guidance.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Brett Huff of Stephens, Incorporated. Your line is now open.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a nice quarter, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","One technical question and one sort of bigger picture. I'm trying to make sure I understand the puts and takes from the, I think, the midpoint 6.18 \u2013 $6.18 (00:46:02) guidance. I think I heard you guys say $0.55 to some other number in terms of net tax benefit, net of reinvestments, could you just give us that number again?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","It's $0.55 to $0.63. And again, to your point, that is a tax benefit net of the reinvestment.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","And then the other things we should think about that are impacting that, we should net that out of the guidance, try and get kind of apples-to-apples to what we were all thinking. You need to add back $0.10 from the lending transaction? Does that sound about, right? I think you guys said 50 bps and the math I do is about $0.10 dilution from that. Is that fair?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","So I guess, two data points. One, we indicated that the impact of the selling the majority interest is about a $0.16 impact...","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","...to 2017. So we are essentially revising or modifying the $5.12 down by $0.16 to the new baseline of $4.96, and then growing the 22% to 27% EPS above that.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Got you. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then my bigger picture question is, you guys have done a remarkable job of buying assets that in many ways were underperforming from other folks and putting them on to your platform and really accelerating sales, I mean, the numbers you guys gave were truly remarkable. I assume there's a lot more stuff out there that you guys see that you can kind of plug into your system. A, is that true? And then, B, where kind of would that be? Where are you looking to get that kind of \u2013 that benefit?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Brett, that's kind of you to say. We do see a lot of opportunity in the market in terms of using your vernacular, buying assets and plugging them into the system. I think we've done a nice job of building a distribution system, and an integration methodology that allows that to happen. Because we've done that, we also recognize that there is a natural limitation that occurs across our distribution force \u2013 we sometimes refer to it internally as shelf space. We can only do so many things in terms of asking our people to sell them, but more importantly, of having the clients be willing to accept what it is we're selling in terms of their own capacity to implement.","So therefore, we have to be pretty pragmatic about what it is we bring in to the system knowing that we have to manage those couple of variables, and balance that against the products and solutions that we build on our own without going out and acquiring them.","So we've really said, let's focus on the solutions that we think have the best macro characteristics, think payments and digital and that if it fits our brand and it fits the things that we're trying to do in terms of equipping our clients.","And I would say also at Investor Day, we talked about payments, digital, account processing as both the distribution system and a place where you can add product like we added over PCLender and our Commercial Center product, and then the last bullet \u2013 or the last component is in this Biller Solutions strategy, which we've identified, call it, I think more than $500 million of annual revenue opportunity that we just began to sell this year. We see that ecosystem as another way to do exactly what we've done in building the distribution system through the core account processing. So kind of a long-winded way of laying that out, but we do see those opportunities.","Now valuations aren't necessarily cooperating with us at this stage, but again, we're willing to go out and buy those things that we think add value for clients and contribute to the growth in revenue and cash flow that we're trying to create within Fiserv.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks for the time.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good results. I just had a follow-up to Joe's question on the margin. You put an upper bound to your margin expansion, which I think is pretty unusual for Fiserv. So I'm just trying to better understand, I mean, should we infer from that that maybe you're more likely to reinvest any upside you might get on the margin side? I know you're talking about core operating margin being very strong, et cetera, but just trying to understand the guide a little better.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. So Tien-Tsin, it \u2013 I think you're right. We typically don't put a 20 basis point range. And in fact, we typically just say it's going to be least a number and then we drive it. We've carved out frankly about as much investment as we can take in this year, so it's not that.","It really is a combination of the underlying dilution from the sale of the majority interest in Lending, coupled with the substantial reduction in termination fee revenue, which obviously comes in at a higher margin. So we think those two are pressuring us. I think it's possible that we could be above that. But we were trying to just give a likely range really for modeling purposes more than anything else.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. No, that's fair, that's fair. It's good to get more parameters for us. We always need it. Two quick ones, if you don't mind. Just on the periodic revenue benefit in the fourth quarter. Did you size that? I mean, is that...?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","We actually did not but order of magnitude, it was about $30 million year-over-year. And as you recall, we were light in the third quarter, about half of that is recovery from \u2013 or rebound of the third quarter weakness coming into the fourth quarter.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks for that. And then just the last one, just I wanted to ask you, Jeff, on the \u2013 I think there's been a couple of articles about Accel network and how you're going after more traditional signature debit business. I was curious sort of what your strategy is there. Could that be a growth driver as we think about Fiserv being a debit business?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, it is. You, I assume, are referring to the Walmart lease.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I mean, we've been doing a lot of work on Accel over the last several years creating what we think is some interesting innovation. We've got a couple of other areas that we're working that we think will further differentiate our network and then obviously benefit our clients along the way. So yes, I mean, we do see one of the drivers of growth acceleration in 2018 to be Accel network innovation.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good stuff. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to your commentary, Jeff, on the outlook for bank consolidation and M&A. On one hand, typically when we have these kind of rate cycles is when more M&A happens. The increased SIFI limits (00:53:48) would suggest that not that maybe your bank clients on the smaller end would be that directly exposed to it. But at the same time, you're talking about valuations up and term fees down.","So maybe kind of give us your feelings on whether you think that even though we've had increased M&A recently, do you think that the numbers actually start to trend down at this stage?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So at least for our purposes, we are planning to have a fairly meaningful reduction in termination fee revenue. Just as a reminder, termination fees are based on both the number of M&A transactions, but the contract term remaining on the acquisitions at the time.","The pulse that we're hearing from the market, and I would say this is more on the bank side of the house, is that valuations are high. The need to consolidate doesn't feel quite as compelling because the revenue line is growing. And I think you'll see people be \u2013 see potential buyers be pickier than maybe they were two years ago. The number of targets is diminishing a bit.","We're also starting on \u2013 quite on the positive side, we're actually starting to see a slight hiccup \u2013 sorry, a slight tick-up in de novo activity, which we deem to be quite positive for the space. And so we're bullish about the space, more bullish right now than we've been in the last few years. We think that likely translates to this reduction in term fees and think we're better off planning for that than frankly where we were over the last several years.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful, thanks. And maybe just a quick question, to follow up on the sales commentary and how that translates to revenue. I think you had sales numbers back in 2016, which were up 20% or something like that, more muted in 2017. I just want to clarify, did the sales that you experienced in 2016, will those all be recognized by the end of 2018 in terms of revenue? And would you expect kind of like a significant pickup in Q2, Q3 as a result of that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, I think it would be way more aggressive than we could be to say all, but we do expect that the substantial majority of the sales that we made in 2016 would begin to hit at some point in 2018. There's always exceptions to that, but that \u2013 we would expect that to be the case. As it relates to the sales in year, I would say we have a practice of increasing our quotas each year. And so the fact that we were up 3% but we missed quota tells you that we actually increased our quotas.","And frankly what happened was there were a couple of larger deals that we've been working in our pipeline that took \u2013 that had not closed in year. We had originally expected that they would close in year. It's not necessarily that they've gone away, but they've just been delayed, and it's one of the reasons why we have some optimism for our 2018 sales performance being higher again than it was in 2017.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Hey. Thanks, guys. I just want to get a question in on the reinvestment you talked about. Obviously, you gave us some indication that some of it was not going to be recurring after this year. But I guess maybe just a little more granularity on the specifics of where you were investing that money now in terms of what may or may not be repeated in 2019? And I guess just given how much demand \u2013 it sounds like demand is growing around the banks in your end market, why wouldn't we expect that to keep going in that level in 2019? Or is it just scale and operating leverage that overcomes that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's a great question. So, as a matter of course, we have been investing in the company for a long time. And in fact, our investments in technology development have been going up, not down, over the last several years. So for us, we didn't view this as, hey, there's all this capital. Let's go invest it. We said, this money belongs to the shareholders of Fiserv. What can we do to make sure that we are optimizing the returns or maximizing the returns over the long term?","And so what we did is we looked at where are the areas in which we can make shorter term investments. We believe that the majority of what it is that we have subsumed in \u2013 or we plan to subsume in 2018 that we will give back over the next 24 months, because the kinds of things that we're doing are geared towards increasing \u2013 sorry, expediting time to market, expediting some projects that were in place. So the kinds of projects that we're thinking about are updates to our user \u2013 some of our user experiences, doing more work and building out more digital experiences faster, making important enhancements to our service delivery platform, looking at how do we expedite payments platform innovation through \u2013 primarily through integration advantage and looking at where are there fringe enhancements that we can make around, again, other aspects of our service model, where are there projects that may be they were slated to be three years and we can bring them up to two years; so those kinds of things that we don't think require a meaningful commitment; and they'll be able to drive revenue and hopefully, therefore, margins.","The last carve-out in there is we are taking a look at our \u2013 holistically, our benefit plans and our compensation programs to make sure that if there are things that we could do to \u2013 on the fringes or on the edges to make it more attractive, we know we're in the business of people and we need to have the right people delivering against these kinds of investments that we're talking about. And so we're just \u2013 we're using that also to make sure that if there's something to do that we do it.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That actually helps a lot. And just one quick follow-up. I mean, look, it sounds like you're not in the market for transformational type deals, obviously. And just based on the commentary we've heard, I mean, you don't seem like you think you need anything more than perhaps a tuck-in here and there. I just want to, A, make sure that's accurate?","And then; B, just give us a little more thoughts on \u2013 from a strategic standpoint, Jeff, domestic versus international. It seems like we're in for domestic more so than international for a while, unless I'm just looking at the demand environment here and extrapolating, but any thoughts?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So let me...","(01:01:10)","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. Let me take the easier one. I would say, we continue to be a primarily domestically focused company. I would say that the Monitise acquisition and the Dovetail acquisition, those are products that we believe we will proliferate actually quite attractively around the world, so we're excited about that. But as it relates to deploying major capital, I would expect it to be more U.S.-centric than non-U.S. centric.","So the point on transformational acquisition, I don't sit here and say, there's anything we need to do to add to our product set that anyone would deem to be transformational. I will say that we see a lot of interesting things on the horizon and the macro trends are evolving. And we will continue to take the actions that we think make the most sense for creating value for shareholders over the longer term.","So far, I think we've not done a major transaction since 2007. And so we're quite comfortable with the path that we're on, but we also want to make sure that we're looking at the world correctly.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. That makes sense. Thanks, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, good evening.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you a high-level one on Zelle. BNY Mellon's (01:02:46) been in the news, talking about now using Zelle for business payments. Can you just remind us on your involvement with Zelle? In other words, are you partnering with the banks for P2P only? Or is there the capability for you to partner with banks if they were, for example, here interested in using Zelle for B2B and not just P2P?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Great question, Jeff. We're partnering with the banks to help them help provide the offerings that are within the Zelle network. We've actually been in the network with our B2B disbursements and our B2C disbursements capability for a couple of years. It's part of the Popmoney suite. We would see that also meeting the needs of our turnkey Zelle service or other kinds of related offering.","So we believe that we will be part of the Zelle journey as the Zelle journey evolves. We've always believed that P2P was the first part of it and that we would be a very important enabler for banks that want to participate in the formation of this network. So we're quite excited about it as we mentioned in our prepared remarks.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Appreciate that. And then can you just \u2013 maybe just remind us in terms of the margins on the Zelle transaction relative to sort of your \u2013 kind of your core business and its trajectory over time? Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So the \u2013 this type of a Payments product is a fixed-cost business primarily and then a step fix as you build load over time. So we would expect the \u2013 eventually as you get the scale that the incremental margins on an electronic transaction will look like many of the other big electronic scale Payments businesses that we have, and then occasionally needing to build an infrastructure to make sure that we're able to support the clients in the real-time world that we're in. The caveat will be as Zelle \u2013 the Zelle network adds more capabilities, I would expect us to be investing more than usual because there's more add-ons coming on. But overall, we would deem that to be a relatively attractive margin business like most of the Payments businesses are.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Bryan.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been asked and answered. Just wanted to add two clarifications. I think full year acquired revenue was something about $49 million for the year. Just trying to think about modeling for fiscal year 2018. Should we think about a similar amount of acquired revenue, call it $50 million, for fiscal year 2018?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","You'll see an increase in the benefit of acquired revenue in 2018, primarily because three of the four acquisitions were in the August-September timeframe. Only the OBS acquisition took place in the very beginning of the year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I would guess it will be up a bit. It'll be up a bit, Bryan.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, we can just model it up, I don't know. We could model a little bit growth. It's just hard to size it given we don't know the exact size of all the acquisitions, but \u2013 just turning to sales on the sales side, I think you guys obviously talked about the sales growth, obviously, being strong in 2016 and then a little bit lower in 2017. Is there a growth rate you have in mind for it to accelerate in 2018, Jeff, in order to keep kind of the internal revenue growth accelerating into fiscal year 2019?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So I would say that the interesting thing is most of what we sell \u2013 as you know, Bryan, most of what we sell in 2018 will probably have a bigger impact on 2020, because of implementation cycles and things like that. It'll either be recognized in-year or they'll actually likely be out towards the second half of 2019 and into 2020.","So a lot of what we need for this year is kind of in the bag in terms of the things that we have sold, but we would be always looking \u2013 because we're geared on creating sustainable kind of moderate increases in internal revenue growth each year, we do need sales to go up. And ideally, if we're going up in the 7% to 15% level, that's pretty good performance.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, very helpful. Congrats on the quarter.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hey, Jeff. Question for you just on mobile banking, Internet banking. It seems as though more banks are looking to put that on a single platform, and I believe you have a product that's similar that would meet that demand. And I'm wondering, how much of the growth you're seeing is the result of banks and credit unions wanting to go that route? And maybe how that benefits \u2013 if that's accurate, how that benefits Fiserv?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, Kartik, we have we do have a platform called Architect that is a single platform for all of the digital experiences online, tablet and mobile. And it's able to also serve retail, small business and smaller commercial customers. So that platform does meet that need. It would say that there is a growing segment of the market that wants that kind of platform less because it's a single platform and more because this platform has tools that allow you to have a little bit more control in-house and some of the more progressive banks are wanting to control more of the experience, so we are seeing that.","I would say that it's a fairly small segment of the market. And while we're winning because of the size of our base, in and of itself, that segment is not gigantic. I think it'll grow over the next decade, which is why we thought this was an important acquisition for us to do in 2016. And it is contributing. Make no mistake, digital capabilities are very important growth drivers to the company, but that segment is still a relatively small segment.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Jeff, we've seen some bank consolidation and obviously term fees, maybe not in 2018 but in 2017, did contribute. Are you seeing any movement by the banks wanting to change contract terms or maybe term fees are capped? Or there is some kind of a change for that than we've seen previously? Just any contract term changes that banks might be looking for.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Kartik, I don't \u2013 listen, I think in any sales contract negotiation, the parties are going to try to get what they want. I would say it's a pretty normal part of the business, so we haven't seen tremendous pressure there. I think in some cases \u2013 I mean, at least, since I've been here, there are often caps in the term fees in terms of the percentages, what is the percentage and how many years. You can see that, but I would say that there's not been any major change in the negotiated terms or the more expected terms in the market.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much, Jeff. Appreciate it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Jennifer Dugan of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. This is Jenny Dugan on for Andrew Jeffrey. I was wondering if you could parse out some of the margin growth just given the different moving parts, kind of parse it out by segment?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","You're looking for 2018?","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","No. We don't provide the growth \u2013 overall, the growth guidance that we gave was the 10 to 30 basis points. We don't typically provide detail of that by segment. Our Payments segment traditionally is a higher margin business, and we certainly would expect that to continue. But I would anticipate both segments providing margin left into 2018.","The reduction in term fees is typically more prevalent in the Financial segment, and so that puts some additional pressure in Financial versus Payments. But overall we see progress outside of that in both segments.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, great. And then when you were talking about the operational effectiveness, were you saying 15 or 50 for this year?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","50, 5-0.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","5-0. Okay. And then lastly, can you give us any sense of the revenue associated with the lending business that's being sold?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Revenue for Lending, that is \u2013 we have essentially treated that as a...","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I think Jenny was looking for \u2013 sorry. Jenny, you were looking for the sizing of the revenue for modeling purposes?","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes, exactly.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. It's well less than 5% of revenue of the company.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, great. Great. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Jeffery W.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer-session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Stephanie Gregor","Thank you and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that this afternoon's earnings release and a supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of our web site at fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.","I must state that otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year and references to the year represent current year results through the end of the third quarter.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks Stephanie and good afternoon everyone. Results for the third quarter were strong across the board. We are executing on our business model, delivering value to clients, and developing products and services that we believe will contribute to increasing our internal revenue growth rate into 2015 and beyond.","We achieved 5% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter, led by 8% adjusted internal revenue growth in our Payments segment. For the first three quarters of the year, adjusted internal revenue growth is above 4%, well within our guidance range, and a solid increase over the 2% growth in the comparable period last year. Adjusted operating margin performance continue to be healthy, increasing 70 basis points in the quarter and year-to-date. The 31.2% rate in the quarter is the highest performance since the launch of our Fiserv 2.0 framework in 2006. We view operating margin as an important outcome of our business model, and a key measure of the differentiated model that our solutions provide for Fiserv clients.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% in the quarter, and is up 13% through September 30. Free cash flow was excellent in the quarter, and is up 13% for the year to $674 million. Free cash flow per share, one of our most important performance metrics, is up 18% to $2.65 for the year.","Total sales in the quarter was up 27% over the prior year, and has increased 14% through September. We are well positioned to close out 2014 as one of our strongest sales years ever.","Now, let me provide an update on our 2014 enterprise priorities, which as a reminder are, first, to continue building high quality revenue growth, while meeting our earnings commitments. Second, extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and last, to deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients.","Our first priority is centered on building our internal revenue growth rate on the back of high quality sustainable recurring revenue. We are executing well against this priority. Adjusted internal revenue growth to-date is at the top end of our 2014 full year guidance of 4% to 4.5%. We have seen strong execution across the majority of our existing businesses, led by our Payments, account processing, and online banking businesses, and good pick-up [ph] in our innovation base solutions, such as Mobiliti.","We continue to see strong adjusted operating margin performance, which is an outcome of our growth in high quality revenue, and utilization of our operational efficiency muscle. Importantly, we are also starting to benefit, as some of the benefit -- the investments we have been making, both in products and acquisitions are beginning to scale.","As our recurring revenue solutions ramp, we expect this performance to support additional margin expansion over time. We are confident in our ability to continue expanding company adjusted operating margin by at least 50 basis points annually, consistent with our long term outlook.","Given our strong results to-date, we have moved our adjusted earnings per share guidance up to $3.34 to $3.38 or a 12% to 13% increase for the full year. We remain solidly on track across our key financial metrics.","Our second priority is to extend market momentum, to deepen client relationships, with a larger share of our strategic solutions. We added 152 new mobile clients this quarter, and now have over 2,000 clients signed for our Mobiliti services. More than 270 institutions have gone live on Mobiliti this year alone, with several hundred remaining in the queue. Mobiliti ASP users this year have grown more than 65% to over 2.5 million subscribers.","Speaking of leadership, our Mobiliti products was recently recognized by Ovum, as the market leader in their global mobile banking lender evaluation. Our award-winning technology allows for ease and extensibility and leadership and customer experience, which is critical as the industry navigates to digital transformation.","We also signed an additional 116 clients to our Mobiliti tablet product this quarter, and now have more than 20% of our mobile clients offering our tablet solution as part of their digital suite. We were very excited to sign our 50th new DNA client since last year's Open Solutions' acquisition. This performance is even more impressive when considering that the entire market, covering all banks and credit unions, has an average of less than 300 core account processing replacements each year. These results are indicative of a move by some larger institutions to consider platforms that have more modern technology, integration advantages with our market leading products, and the benefits of real time experiences.","Through September 30, 11 of the 50 new DNA clients were live, including two of the larger credit unions in the country. Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union at $6.5 billion in assets, and Navigant Credit Union, a $1.5 billion institution. Both of these clients are excited about their new technology platforms, and we look forward to serving them for many years to come.","Our market momentum goes well beyond DNA. As an example, we were pleased to extend our technology relationship in the quarter, with First Republic Bank with $46 billion in assets, for account processing and other services. This relationship came to Fiserv as part of the Open Solutions acquisition as well, and is yet another example of the opportunities we are forging with that client base.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients. On our last call, we mentioned the July launch of Agiliti, our cloud-based retail bank technology solution in the U.K. In just a few months, we have seen strong interest from both de novo and existing institutions, which is fueling excellent pipeline growth. We expect our first live clients towards the middle of next year.","We are also establishing a beachhead with our new Mobiliti business product, to help banks deliver digital capabilities to their coveted business customers. Interest in this solution is high, and we started adding new clients in the quarter. This solution should start contributing to revenue growth in 2015.","We have a number of new solutions pointed at the evolving ecosystem of real-time money movement through financial institutions. This area is increasingly in a spotlight, and we believe our assets, which include payment rails, applications, channel capabilities and intelligent decisioning through risk tools and analytics are positioning us well in this emerging new reality. We were seeing early adopting financial institutions use these services to deliver value for their customers and to generate fee income.","Now let me turn the call to Tom to provide addition detail on our financial results.","Tom Hirsch","Thanks Jeff and good afternoon everyone. Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, and $3.5 billion for the first nine months of the year. Our adjusted internal revenue growth rate was 5% in the quarter, and is above 4% year-to-date, showing strong acceleration over the prior year, and at the upper end of our 2014 growth rate guidance.","Adjusted operating income increased 7% in both the quarter and the first nine months, to $370 million and $1.1 billion respectively. Adjusted operating margin was up 70 basis points to 31.2% in the quarter, and expanded 60 basis points sequentially. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin is up 70 basis points to 30.5%.","As Jeff mentioned, we have an intense focus on growing our high quality recurring revenue businesses. This effort includes scaling up our newer businesses such as Mobiliti ASP, along with executing on our operational effectiveness initiatives, which contribute meaningfully to the strong margin performance.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% in the quarter, and 13% year-to-date. As important, our earnings this year have converted into free cash flow for our shareholder at an even higher rate, growing free cash flow per share by 18% to $2.65.","Now on to the segment results; adjusted internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 8% in the quarter, and at 7% for the year. The strong growth was led by client and transaction growth in card services, digital channels, bill payment, and our output solutions businesses. We signed 40 new debit clients in the quarter and have added nearly 100 for the year.","In addition to offer compelling integration advantages, we continue to provide additional value for our clients, through add-on services geared to enhance risk and fraud capabilities, EMV, tokenization and other innovation needed to stay abreast of a rapidly changing Payments landscape. The combination of adding new institutions and extending relationships with existing clients has enabled us to produce above market debit transaction growth of 11% in both the quarter and year-to-date.","We also signed 77 new bill payment clients in the quarter, and have added 247 clients through September 30. Bill payment transaction volume grew 2% in the quarter, and is up 4% in the first nine months. Although transaction growth this year has been negatively impacted by our largest client, we recently converted a larger bill payment client, and expect to implement a similar sized client by the end of the year. We added 85 institutions to the Popmoney network in the quarter, and have over 2,300 institutions contracted to offer these services. We continue to believe in person-to-person payments as an important growth opportunity for the financial industry. In particular, we are seeing the emergence of instant payments as a top strategic priority at many larger financial institutions. Our pipeline for Popmoney instant payments is growing well.","Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 16% in the quarter to $201 million and year-to-date adjusted operating income increased 9% to $566 million. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter of 32.9% was exceptional, increasing 210 basis points over the prior year. These results were primarily driven by growth in some of our newer recurring revenue solutions, and an enhanced mix of overall business in the quarter. For the year, segment adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points to 31.6%.","Adjusted internal revenue growth in the financial segment was 1% in the quarter, and is up nicely at 2% versus flat in the comparable period last year. Adjusted internal revenue growth in both periods was primarily driven by gains in our account processing and lending businesses, which includes higher one time fees.","Segment growth was negatively impacted by difficult comparisons in our international group, and the lag associated with new implementations of account processing solutions, with an emphasis on the backlog for DNA.","Adjusted operating income in the financial segment was down 2% in the quarter to $193 million, but is up 5% to $581 million through September. Adjusted operating margin was 32.8% for the quarter, and 33% for the year. Operating margin for the quarter was impacted by several factors, including business mix and the timing of certain expenses. Financial segment margin performance for the year has been very strong, increasing 100 basis points, primarily driven by solid execution in our account processing businesses. The impact of operational effectiveness initiatives, including open synergies, partially offset by the current year international performance.","The adjusted operating loss in the corporate segment for the quarter was $24 million, which is in line with the prior year, and down $4 million sequentially. Our adjusted tax rate increased to 34.7% in the quarter, compared to 33.5% last year. The rate increase negatively impacted results in the quarter by $0.02 per share. The adjusted effective tax rate through September is slightly lower than last year's at 33.7%. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.","We have received over $100 million in cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture this year, including $63 million in the third quarter. These distributions are excluded from our reported free cash flow performance. StoneRiver continues to very effectively monetize the business, through dispositions and refinancings. Gains related to dispositions are also excluded from our adjusted results. Given the reduced portfolio of businesses within StoneRiver, our adjusted equity earnings for this year are down about $0.03 compared to the prior year.","As Jeff mentioned earlier, a key benefit of increasing the level of high quality revenue growth is strong free cash flow generation. In the first nine months of the year, free cash flow grew 13% to $674 million. Free cash flow per share in the first nine months of the year was up 18% to $2.65. Total debt at September 30th was $3.8 billion or 2.3 times our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA.","We remain committed to using our capital in ways that build long term shareholder value. As an example, in the quarter, we have repurchased 4.2 million shares for $270 million. Through September 30th, we have deployed $789 million, repurchasing 13.3 million shares at an average cost of $59 per share. We have returned well over 100% of our reported free cash flow to shareholders in 2014. As of quarter's end, there were 245.3 million shares outstanding and 5.2 million shares remaining under existing share repurchase authorization.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks Tom. As we mentioned upfront, sales for the quarter were strong at 128% of quota, and 101% in payment year-to-date. Importantly, actual sales were at a record level, up 27% in the quarter. Total sales for the year are up 14%.","We are seeing strong demand across our product portfolio, in particular, there is growing interest in our large account processing service, digital channels, payments including real time solutions, along with early traction and our focused international strategy. Integrated sales were also strong in the quarter at $70 million and are $172 million for the year. The leading solutions for Mobiliti ASP, bill payment, source capture, card solutions and online banking. We are well positioned to achieve our $250 million integrated sales target for the year. We have recorded $50 million of operational effectiveness savings in the first nine months of the year, or 83% of our $60 million annual target.","Even with the majority of the Open Solutions cost synergies accounted for, we continue to see a long runway of opportunity and believe we will drive economic value for a number of years through our core operational effectiveness programs.","The client environment remained stable in the quarter. There were only four regulatory actions in the period and 19 year-to-date, which is just over half as many as last year. We expect regulatory actions will continue to approach normal levels, and we also believe M&A activities will remain quite active.","Financial institutions have generally remained committed to their spending plans, and improvement over the trailing off we have seen occur over the last several years. Technology spend continues to be weighted to areas such as digital experience, regulatory compliance, cost effectiveness, and solutions that enable financial institutions to generate additional revenue.","The neediest and most significant industry discussions right now are centered on point of sale transactions, including EMV issuance, data breaches, security, tokenization and of course, Apple Pay. Even the White House jumped into the fray in October, pushing Chip and PIN for government payments. These programs, when taken together, should create a more secure payment experience and increase consumer confidence. We anticipate these changes to be a large opportunity and are prepared to help our clients make the transition in a rapidly evolving point-of-sale payments landscape.","As I mentioned upfront, we entered the fourth quarter very well positioned to meet our 2014 financial objectives. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 5% and net adjusted internal revenue will grow 4.5% for the year, a meaningful increase over last year's 3% internal growth. We have increased our expectations for full year adjusted EPS growth, and now expect growth to be in the range of 12% to 13% or $3.34 to $3.38. We still expect that adjusted operating margin will increase at least 50 basis points for the full year, and that the combination of increased internal revenue and operating margin expansion will translate into at least 10% free cash flow per share growth or greater than $3.65 for the year.","We enter the final quarter of the year in a position of strength. We are executing well, are on track for a step-up in our internal revenue growth rate, and fully expect to achieve our 29th consecutive year of double digit adjusted earnings per share growth. These results, combined with our forward visibility, gives us confidence that we will see another increase in our internal revenue growth rate in 2015.","We recently completed our associate engagement survey and saw a meaningful increase in the overall level of engagement. We know it is our people, and how they engage with our clients that makes the difference. We couldn't be more proud of the work our more than 21,000 associates do each day, to make your company, one of the world's most admired.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies","Thanks guys. How should we think about the long term organic group trajectory in the Financial Solutions segment? Where it's kind of landing now, sort of what we should be expecting in modeling going forward, or what are some potential input there that might see that accelerate a bit?","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks Ramsey, it\u2019s a good question. We have said for several years now, that we expected that our internal revenue growth rate would be able to step-up each year for a number of years, and as we mentioned we got a -- obviously, we are stepped up nicely for this year and based on what we can see moving forward, we expect to see another step up into 2015. And that growth, we did expect that it would have a bit of a bias for the Payments segment, given those kind of solutions and the growth characteristics of that business.","However, we are actually pretty bullish about what's going on in the financial segment. We mentioned -- we signed our 50th DNA client in the quarter, have 11 of them live, which means obviously we have 39 still in backlog, but we also are winning a number of large transactions across the landscape. So whether it's in our signature platform, Premier, or in DNA, we have got a lot of good momentum and backlog. And we are just really start to see those clients go live, based on actually the signings that we talked about even last year at Investor Day. So we have good visibility there. We believe we will continue to step up.","And we are also actually pretty excited about what's going on in our lending businesses. We are seeing financial institutions realize that the lending area is the place over time, where they are probably the most experienced at making money and we are seeing solutions get evaluated and looking for potential upgrades both in the origination and on the servicing side.","So we see some nice macros in both of those areas, we think that will translate to some better growth for us moving forward in the financial segment. So I would say that, we do expect that to grow. To continue to grow, I would say that that will step, but again, be slightly less than kind of growth acceleration we are seeing on the Payments side.","Tom Hirsch","And then I'd just add one more thing to that. It would probably be around international, which was included in that particular segment. And as we mentioned on the call, we have had some very difficult comparisons and that are probably impacting the company overall by about 1% and the -- so going into the financial segment by about 1% from a growth rate standpoint. So I think as we look over the next several years, we are going to continue to grow that business, but actually help us accelerate growth in the segment overall as we look into the next couple of years.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies","And none of the softness, you mentioned from the tough international comparisons. None of that you perceived to be anything related like a macro headwind from the different regions you're operating, and it really just has to do with the tough compare?","Tom Hirsch","That's correct.","Jeff Yabuki","Actually we would say that, on balance some of the technology solutions that w have introduced, such as Agiliti in the U.K. actually are riding some macro tailwinds, as opposed to the opposite. We are pretty focused on what we do internationally, so we feel good about the growth characteristics moving forward.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies","Okay. One last one for me; you mentioned you recently converted a larger bill payment client, you expect to implement another similar sized client. Maybe you can just give us an update or some commentary on sort of -- what sizable deals that maybe you have mentioned in the past remain in the sort of backlog pipeline waiting to be implemented. Once we get these few large deals sort of through, does that sort of cap-off the implementation cycle you've kind of launched several cycles ago with a nice big win?","Jeff Yabuki","The two clients that Tom referenced in his prepared remarks, are the two remaining larger clients that we had called out, actually one of them, even a couple of years ago. So we are finally starting to go live; that will anniversary kind of late 2015 and so those named clients we would be through. By the same token, we've had a couple of hundred bill payment clients that we have signed this year and a number of them sizable; not at the names level, but the bulk of the clients, we are still seeing a high level of attractiveness on that front; and we are also seeing good focus on expedited bill payment as one of the add-on capabilities across the entire network of several thousand bill payment install. So we think we are in pretty good shape moving forward.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies","Great. That's all for me. Thanks guys.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks Ramsey.","Operator","Thank you. David Togut from Evercore, your line is open.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Thank you. Good afternoon Jeff and Tom.","Jeff Yabuki","Hey David.","Tom Hirsch","Hey David.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Given the 50 new signings you've mentioned for DNA, at what [indiscernible] will these signings actually convert over the next 12 months, and can financial organic growth get up to a mid-single digit level, let's say by the end of 2015?","Jeff Yabuki","You know David, we aren't in the business of giving guidance for 2015 and Tom would especially not want us to talk about the segment-by-segment guidance. What I would say is that the majority of the meaningful installs will start to come live -- towards the middle of next year, long install cycle, so that will take some time. And also remember that part of our core value proposition is not just delivering the account processing piece, but also delivering many of the surround products; debit, channel, some of the payment solutions, risk, lending. So a lot of ancillary content that starts to go live, that's the good news; the bad news is it takes a little bit longer to move through those implementation cycles.","So I think you will see -- I actually don't think we will hit our peak performance in the financial segment until probably into the 2016 timeframe, just given the momentum that we have now, and I will also tell you that, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are quite enthusiastic right now about the kinds of evaluations that are occurring in the market, in terms of larger institutions taking a look at the modern real-time oriented platforms, that frankly had it not been for the acquisition of Open Solutions, we probably would not be in line for some of those larger institution evaluation, those will be more dominated by the non-U.S. players.","So that is going to also give us momentum. As far as the longer range modeling goes, I think we will say we continue to expect those step-ups and we will continue to keep you informed as to how our progress is looking.","Tom Hirsch","David, I would probably just add to that, as you see our Payments segment, year-to-date growth at about seven, compared to 4% this time last year, and the Financials segment actually at 2 compared to flat. So we have seen some good growth there. I think the other thing to Jeff's point is one of the important things around these deals in these large AT or the DNA deals, since a lot of that surround revenue, really show up in our Payments segment. So its very important to note that a lot of the bill payments and debit revenue continues to be shown in the Payments segment revenue growth, while we will get the core processing revenue that flows through financials, its really an important driver of future success, really in both segments, because that revenue shows up in both of our operating segments.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Understood. Just ratably, it looks like you're ahead of year-to-date plan in terms of operational effectiveness, 83% of target. You expect to significantly exceed the cost takeout target this year, as you had in the past?","Tom Hirsch","We are on track. As you well know, we are doing very well on the Open Solutions synergies, and so we are on track for a good year in regards to that particular metric, and we are very pleased. You can see it show up. As Jeff kind of highlighted David, you have been with us for a long period of time or followed the company. We had our highest margin -- in the third quarter since the launch of Fiserv 2.0 back in 2006. So we are pleased with that, as part of that has been our operational effectiveness initiatives, and again, we have more opportunities as we continue to look forward to continue to expand margins. As Jeff talked about, we are very confident of that, and do a number of things around the scaling of our new solutions or operational effectiveness and a host of other things.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Just a quick final question Tom, third quarter term fees versus year ago and then September 30th share count?","Tom Hirsch","Yes you know, as you are aware David, the level of termination fees really varies from period-to-period based upon the number and kind of the size of clients acquired. And just for a little backdrop, termination fees are usually about 1% of our total revenues and they really fluctuate year-on-year as you know. We believe overall, these types of fees this year are up across the industry, and we are seeing the benefit this year from termination fees also.","Your specific question around the quarter, term fees are up around $10 million in the quarter versus the prior year, and it was roughly around $5 million in both of the segments, and as we head into the fourth quarter, we expect a more difficult comparison, just given the -- what we had in the prior year.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","And then 9\/30 share count?","Tom Hirsch","Oh, I am sorry. So I think 245.3 million.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Perfect. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Adam Dahms from Baird, your line is open.","Adam Dahms - Robert W. Baird","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Jeff Yabuki","Sure.","Adam Dahms - Robert W. Baird","So you guys serve more banks than pretty much anyone, and we keep hearing that the banks are -- obviously willing to give up about 15 bips that they are interchanged with regard to Apple Pay. I am wondering if you guys are hearing anything on why they are going to give up this chunk of interchange? And then on that, are there any potential economic benefits for Fiserv, do you think kind of work to integrate this initiative?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. So Adam I would -- I mean at least in the conversations that we have typically had with institutions, there is a level of energy and excitement around the pretense that Apple Pay, and frankly other kinds of electronic transaction portals at point-of-sale will convert cash and to a lesser degree, check transactions to electronic, which will carry a level of interchange. So there has been a belief that that would in effect, wipe out the amount of -- or at least an optimism that will wipe out the incremental interchange or a basis point [indiscernible] and share it with Apple.","There is also some more technical stuff and quotes around card present and card not present rates, in which there is an agreement that, typically some transactions that would have been treated as card not present will now be treated as card present, given the security and that changes the interchange rates as well. So I think there is a kind of a net-net around that, that's going to have, that has banks be willing to do this.","Adam Dahms - Robert W. Baird","Great. Thank you. And any benefit -- is there any way you guys seem kind of getting on that --","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah I am sorry, I missed that element of it. I mean obviously, as a processor, any of the transactions that are converted to a card-based transaction, we have got -- if they are debt, we have got debit processing fees, we have network fees, we have -- and we just -- one of the things that I like is just training consumers to be more -- have a higher propensity to use a digital payment mechanism, and so using your mobile phone at point-of-sale is going to make you just that much more interested in using your mobile phone for non-point-of-sale transactions, which as you know, is a very important part of our business model, whether its around bill payment or person-to-person transaction. So we like that training element as well.","Adam Dahms - Robert W. Baird","Makes sense. Thanks a lot.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan Securities. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Great, thanks. Good results here. I guess on the totals page -- I just wanted to ask on the total sales, 27%, quite strong, sounds like its going to help fuel acceleration to next year if that makes sense. Just curious, has this continued into October and have client priorities just changed, just wanted to get a little bit more color on what's driving this?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah, thanks Tien-tsin. Couple of things going on in the quarter. We mentioned, you may remember that after Q2, we were -- we had a little bit of light Q2, we saw some transactions slip into Q3, and so we obviously picked those up. But we are seeing the institutions continue to spend, and as I think you know, you are one of the folks who had been monitoring spending and seeing it trail off in the second half of the year for the last several years, and we are not seeing that kind of trailing occur. So we are seeing the interest at the FI level continue to be there. We are seeing strong interest in activity on the lending side, both from core financial institutions, as well as some of the non-traditional banks, some of the non-bank lenders who are out there, making -- investigating and making purchases in that space and of course in the online digital channel space as well as payments.","So it's really a combination of all of those things coming together. As far as October, I hate to say this, but most sales forces take a little bit of a breather after they close a quarter. We are encouraged by how our pipeline looks moving forward, and we are frankly counting on a strong finish to the year.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Got it. Good to know. I guess, as my follow-up, I heard the instant payment demand and what not. I am curious, given a lot of talk about ACH again, and the clearinghouse sort of clearing this real time payment system, I guess in parallel with some other things that are out there. What does that mean Jeff for Fiserv? Is it good, bad and different? Love to hear your feedback, thanks.","Jeff Yabuki","I think its great news actually. And the fact that there is -- almost unanimous support across the industry for a methodology that allows consumers and businesses to move money at the speed of their choice is quite positive. By the same token, believing that the right answer in the near term at least is a construction of a new rail, I think is unlikely to -- I have a hard time seeing how that solution allows consumers and businesses to transact in the near term. So I think you're going to see some kind of set of hybrid solutions. I think we are all looking at what are the best ways to get to the end, which is allowing that choice in transactional speed.","In the near to mid term, I am highly confident that our solutions will play a role in how institutions will transact, and I think it will allow us to bring the kind of choice that we have talked about to our applications, such as bill payment and Popmoney that will fit very well into this new consumer experience at value speed, potentially above all else. So we're pretty bullish about it and pretty excited about it.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Makes sense. Appreciate the comments.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Paul Condra from BMO Capital Markets, your line is open.","Paul Condra - BMO Capital Markets","Great. Thanks for taking my call. I wondered maybe you could talk a little bit more about, what you're seeing for EMV? I know you have talked about potential opportunities there, but any deals that you're winning and any trends that you're noticing, that you can get more detail on?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure Paul. Thanks. Clearly, lots and lots of conversations around EMV. Those conversations got a little bit more complicated around the Apply Pay announcement, just in terms of having mindshare moving around. But there is no question that, it's not a matter of it, it's just a matter of when. We see all the same data that you all see around a number of cards, both credit and debit, that are anticipated to move. Most of our card processing is centered around debit. Most of our card production is centered around debit. We were very happy to see that, for example, Bank of America announced they are going to reissue their debit cards this year. With Chip, I think we have seen some of the other large institutions do that, we think that's very good news, both in terms of -- for the industry and for consumers around how they transact, but as well as for our business.","To the second part of your question really around deals that we are winning, we have a very good position. We really aren't in a place where we can talk about it. But I would say that we are doing, at least as well as we though we would do, if not better. Now again, very few cards have actually been reissued. We think those reissue cycles have run over the next several years. I would guess that 2015 would be the lowest of all of the years, but there is going to be a lot of activity in that space, over the next several years.","Paul Condra - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks. That's helpful. And then just trying to understand, are your bank clients Apple Pay enabled, and then if they want to be, do you have some kind of role to play in that?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. So a number of our institutions are currently Apple Pay enabled, and we work with our clients to make sure that they are enabled to do the things that are necessary to have become enrolled in Apple Pay. There is a lot of noise in the market right now around deadlines and dates, and I think much of that is settling out. I think that yesterday, there was announcement coming out of Apple about a million cards are currently enrolled in Apple Pay. So obviously, we are quite early. I think that's going to involve. But as the processor to the clients, we do work in partnership, to make sure that they have the capabilities that they need to participate in that program.","Paul Condra - BMO Capital Markets","All right. Thank you. Nice quarter.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One question on bill pay, you talked about the new large client win that you have coming out at the end of the year, and the other client wins, do you think the bill payment transactions can get sustainably north of 5% for the foreseeable future as we go into 2015 and beyond?","Jeff Yabuki","I do think the natural rate of bill payment is actually in excess of 5%. Just given how transactions are electronifying. Today, something or in round numbers, the number of paper payments related to bill are still around 50%, so there is a heck of a lot of growth that is still available in the market.","I think in order for that to happen, you've got a couple of things that have to occur. You have to continue to see this convergence between payment enabling and digital, I think that's one of the big catalysts that you see out there. You got to have more opportunities for consumers to choose speed of their choice or to select the speed of their choice when making a payment, that's a critical element of it, and that's one of the things that we were talking about earlier around the creation of some of these rail, we are actually very enthusiastic in that area.","And then third, we have to continue to win some number of transactions. The majority of institutions, which we do very well. The majority of our growth in payments over the last several years has really come from winning new clients. We have got a lot of focus now on how do we make those clients more capable in terms of the experience in driving more payment volumes.","The last thing I want to talk about, because I think its really important Jim is, in that business, there are two ways that we grow revenue. We grow revenue on the basis of new transactions or additional transactions and we grow revenue by increasing the average value of every transaction, and one of the areas in which we are very focused is on driving expedited payments, because we see that as an opportunity to take some of the 1.3 billion transactions that are in existence today, have them go a little bit faster and create more revenue per transaction. We have risk capabilities, we have customization and other services that we are delivering in that space, and frankly, that's an area where we have not done anywhere near all we can do, and I see that to be a nice opportunity to drive revenue growth in parallel to driving just core transaction growth.","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful, thank you. And then as a follow-up, with respect to your -- as we look into 2015 and looking at your 50 basis points or better operating margin targets over the long term, can you talk to how much of that is going to be driven by normal leverage in the business, versus how much do you think you can wring out in terms of additional cost synergies above and beyond the open cost synergies that you've realized in 2014? Any kind of color on the additional synergies to be realized on the cost side would be helpful?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah, so let -- Tom why don't you?","Tom Hirsch","Jim is your question around Open or the general? We are going to continue down the pathway of our operational effectiveness initiatives, and so that's going to be clearly a component of what we are going to have over the next three years. But it is going to be combined with a scaling of our newer solutions, things like Mobiliti, where we have made a number of investments and we are getting to a nice scale position as we move forward over the next several years. So again, its early for 2015 from a guidance standpoint, but it is going to be a combination of activities.","Jeff Yabuki","And Jim I would say, I don't have the data in front of me, I will have Stephanie follow-up with you; but we still have a fairly large pool of operational effectiveness saves in which we have identified and then we basically look to optimize our effort across the company, putting some of it to growing internal revenue, putting some of it to continuing to take out and restructure our expenses and our processes to deliver more value. So we still have a good sized pool there. But I think to your question, we are going to see a fair amount of leverage over the next few years, in scaling some of these solutions, like the Mobiliti ASP solution that we talk a lot about, were up to -- I think the number was 65% growth in subscribers to 2.5 million.","If you look at our Payments margin over the last couple of years, you will see that those margins have been under pressure, because most of our investments have been in the Payments segment over the last couple of years. Those are now starting to convert, and we will see that leverage come through in our results.","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. Thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Chris Shutler from William Blair and company, your line is open.","Chris Shutler - William Blair","Hey guys, good afternoon.","Jeff Yabuki","Hey Chris.","Chris Shutler - William Blair","So first on Mobiliti, I know that you're seeing pretty strong uptake there. Maybe just Jeff, could you remind us the revenue model, can you give us rough sense of where revenue stands today for Mobiliti and then if you look at usage within your FI client base, what percentage of end clients that actually have access to the platform are using it today?","Jeff Yabuki","Good questions Chris. The model, there are three core variations of the Mobiliti model. There is a license and services straight model, so the larger institutions, the U.S. banks of the world, we sell them the license, we work with them on a services basis, and then we continue to work with them to modify as they deem appropriate, and then they would pay us on kind of a seat basis. The second variation of the model is, taking the first piece and then adding hosting, so we would actually host it in our data centers and we do that for several larger clients.","And then the third one is really the ASP model. So we build it, we run it in our data centers, and the model for that is the institutions pay us for each of the users, we refer to them as subscribers on a monthly basis, and they would be paying us on the basis of, are they using kind of the core phone piece alone, do they have tablet on top of that, and then we also have been talking about Mobiliti for business, which is the next iteration of ASP or cloud-based offering. So those are the three different revenue models that we have today.","As far as the overall revenue, we don't break that out. Historically at Investor Day, we have talked about where we sit in that business. [Indiscernible] will do the same thing, when we do our Investor Day in June. Probably, what I can tell you is, I think we are still in the fairly early innings of what that mobile opportunity looks like, as compared to where our online banking business is, if you think about the users. One of the benefits -- one of the embedded benefits that we have is that, historically, especially for the smaller institutions, Mobiliti integration occurs through the online banking platform, and because we have tens of millions of users using that platform, it\u2019s a simpler and easier way to go and we believe over time, those institutions will end up selecting us. There are still a very large number of institutions, who have not yet selected Mobiliti, and we believe that that will continue to grow for us over time.","Chris Shutler - William Blair","Great, thanks. And then just a couple of real quick follow-ups. One is on the buyback, and you guys have been quite aggressive this year, I think 789 repurchased, relative to kind of 460 to 580 the last couple of years this time a year. Just any kind of thoughts, why maybe you have been more aggressive and then secondly, the depreciation and amortization line looked like it fell off a decent bit sequentially, just want to make sure, as we model that going forward that it should be fairly consistent with Q3 levels? Thanks.","Jeff Yabuki","So I will take the share repurchase question, and I will let Tom deal with the more technical one, then he can comment as well. But on the share repurchase question, remember last year we also acquired Open Solutions, so that was a fairly hefty allocation of capital. And we have said over time, is we are going to allocate our capital, in a way that we think makes the most sense for shareholders, and that we use share repurchase as our capital allocation benchmark. We have not completed any acquisitions this year, and we believe that the combination of increasing internal revenue growth, market momentum, and the margin runway that we see, that we believe that we have got an attractive business over time, and therefore the repurchase has made sense, and we will continue to look at that on a period-by-period basis.","Tom Hirsch","And Chris, regarding the -- I will take this offline with you, but just to me, when I look at the cash flow statement, its relatively consistent for the nine months with where we were in the last nine months and even on a quarter basis. Let me take that offline and give me a shout, and then we can go through that.","Chris Shutler - William Blair","Sounds good. Thanks a lot.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks so much Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup, your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Thanks. So good performance especially on the margin front. The question I have is, of the margin improvement that you had in total, what was the -- is it possible to separate out the contribution of operating effectiveness versus synergies related to Open, to the extent you still have them? It has a impact on a go forward expectations I guess with regards to how long it has been continued [ph] improving margins at this pace?","Jeff Yabuki","Ashwin, let me start with it, and then Tom and Mark can add in, as it makes sense. Its difficult to look at all the contributors to margin on a pure vertical or siloed basis. I mean, we have a number of different contributors, operational effectiveness, which includes kind of the core muscle that we have built over the years, reengineer our cost structures and our processes to be more effective. You have got the synergies from Open, you have got the scaling from some of our solutions. But on saying that, you have investments in new technologies and other areas in which we know we have to build, so that we can continue to grow our level of high quality sustainable revenue growth. And so in any year, we are making trade-offs that allow us to invest the amount of money that we need to invest at an enterprise level.","One of the things that we talk about a lot is, we could have higher margins, if we didn't see opportunities to invest. Thankfully, we are in a situation where we do have that. And so we use those levers simultaneously to make sure that we are in a place where we can grow the business over a long period of time, and also expand margins. So -- and when certainly, when certain streams of revenues come in, in a different way, we are always looking what are the kinds of things that we can do, to continue to make sure that we are making the right investments so that shareholders benefit and clients benefit over a long period of time.","Mark Ernst","One thing I'd add to that is, to your point about, so how sustainable is that 50 basis point, or a greater margin expansion, and how many years is that good for. Sitting here today, we can clearly see plenty of reengineering opportunities across the company and the portfolio of things that we do, that give us high confidence that that long term objective is in fact a long term attainable objective.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","That's good to know. One follow-up question on a separate topic which is bill pay. Obviously, you guys have had a lot of good, I guess, market share driven growth. But as you sort of look at what's left, right? I mean, you have already signed a lot of large clients. Do you see sort of a large diminishing returns with regards to -- you have to now go sign a lot more mid-sized clients, in order to achieve the same things that you did with the signing of TD or Wells or so on.","Jeff Yabuki","I am sorry Ashwin, I didn't mean to cut you off. So I would say that, we are in the fortunate position to have a nice market share across the largest institutions in the U.S., and where we have to go moving forward, is in the kind of the middle of the market, where we actually have a surprisingly low level of penetration. So we have a very attractive penetration rate across the top 20 institutions. But if you look at the top 20 -- I am sorry, the number 21, they call it the number 50. We are surprisingly low penetrated in those markets; and so, we have real opportunities. And if you go back and look at press releases over the last couple of years, you will see that we are just beginning to win in those phases.","So we won't have the one big win probably, but we will have two or three wins that actually look bigger than those one win. So we are still pretty optimistic and pretty bullish about that end of the market. But I do want to also reinforce that today, we are still seeing a tiny percentage of the payments for household that are actually being executed, even by our most loyal users. So I do think there is a big opportunity there for us in that space, and some of the convergence that we talked about earlier should also help that.","And then lastly, we obviously have the revenue per transaction commentary that we talked about earlier. So still a lot of opportunity in that space overall.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Absolutely. If I can squeeze one more in, is there any benefit or detriment either way I am just kind of -- opening it up for you with regards to, what happens with the bill payment business as your real time payment business kind of grows? Is it a cost benefit that you can get from that, or I mean, is it not related then, just that --?","Jeff Yabuki","So actually, we shared a little bit of this at our last Investor Day. I mean, we are actually quite bullish, that the bill payment business will benefit in two ways by real time. First is that some percentage of the 1.3 billion or so transactions a year will get converted to a real-time transaction, and that will drive value for the financial institution, and then drive some incremental revenue for us on a per transaction basis. But I actually think the biggest opportunity is not the conversion of the existing clients. But I think there is an educational element that's missing in the market.","When someone wants to pay a bill right now, they aren't thinking about going to their banks. So they aren't even bothering to go to the bank aggregator side to do that. They are going to bill or direct, they are going to a walking counter, they are doing whatever they are doing, but they are not going to the aggregation site, and that should bring in my opinion, many, many, many more transactions than we are seeing today, that will not only add to the transaction count, but actually come in at a higher level. And that's really not my opinion, that's the opinion of the market participants that we are really supporting, as we build our technology out.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Understood. Thank you, Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research, your line is open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Hey good afternoon, Jeff, Tom and Mark. Jeff, a question for you. Well you talked a lot about Mobiliti, you talked a little bit about Popmoney and bill payment; and maybe you already do this, but if you don't, is there an opportunity for you to create a payment gateway sword [ph] to sell to the banks? And by payment gateway, something that where a bank tends to have bill payment, Mobiliti or Popmoney all on one screen to be able to tell to its consumers, if that makes sense?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah; I mean, we do see that, and that's a bit of how we operate today. Its one of the reasons why we said that, the online banking and the mobile experiences are so important. And so to the extent that we can provide that, we think we have a very significant advantage in delivering our non or beyond point-of-sale payments capability. So bill pay, Popmoney, TransferNow, those kinds of things. And then when you wrap it with speed, kind of the speed of choice, and then the intelligence that underlies that, we think there is a definite advantage to us. And frankly, we have seen this playing out in the market for the last three or four years. The reason why we have done so well in areas such as account processing, is we are delivering this very full bundle of not just any technologies, but award winning innovative technologies that our clients get, and when the account processing selection processes occur, we always hear, hey, we are selecting Fiserv on the benefit of the integration advantages that we can deliver.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Then Jeff, there is not a lot of talk, and you talked about EMV and just the change in the payment landscape that's happening. Are there any holes you need to fill as a result of these new changes, and the need to acquire any technology or services that would position you better to when it deals?","Jeff Yabuki","No. I mean we are actually quite well positioned right now. We build our own -- again, one of the investments that we have been making, is building out our capability, to make sure that when the EMV cycle starts, that we are absolutely ready to go and that's across our cards solutions businesses, as well as our output solutions businesses. So we are in very good shape in that area.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And Tom, just a clarification, I want to make sure I understood you right. Tom, did you say that your termination fees in 3Q 2014 were $10 million greater than 3Q 2013?","Tom Hirsch","That's correct. About $5 million in each segment.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Tom Hirsch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","Hi, this is Ashish Sabadra, calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Thanks for taking my question. Quick question on the Payments segment; Tom, you provided some highlights --","Jeff Yabuki","Excuse me. We are having a really hard time understanding you.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","Sorry about that. Can you hear me okay now?","Jeff Yabuki","We can try.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","Sorry. So my question was more around the Payments segment. So Tom you highlighted strength, broad-based strength in the payment, but I was just wondering if you could just parse out, was there anything of particular strength, and then particular things which were strong in that segment in this quarter? And just the sustainability of the growth in the fourth quarter and going forward, do you get hit into some tough comps going forward?","Tom Hirsch","I think overall, well you just look at our year-to-date metrics and our Payments segment is at about 7%, up from 4% in the prior year. And as I put my comments, we just really had in the quarter, at least good growth amongst all of our areas, so whether that'd be card services, our digital channels business which is in our Payments segment, our output solutions business, our bill payment business from a revenue growth standpoint. So we just saw really good growth, and its also on a year-to-date business by a number of the businesses that are included in that segment.","And as Jeff kind of highlighted around areas like bill payment etcetera, we have some good opportunity in the future to continue to do better than what we are doing today, from an opportunity to continue to grow transaction volume and revenue in areas like our bill payment business. So we are pleased with our progress, but we continue to believe we have very good opportunities in each of those different areas, which comprise online banking, Mobiliti, our output business, our bill payment business, and continuing really superb performance in our card services business with trunk [ph] growth of about 11% on a year-to-date basis. So again, we expect over the next several years, that segment is going to continue to grow well, and we have some good opportunities for further growth.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","That's great. Just a quick one; on the financial segment side, the operating margin there. You highlighted that there was some impact from business mix and timing of certain expenses, but it has been trending very well for the full year. So as we think about the margins and specifically in the FI segment for the rest of the year and going forward, there are some synergy opportunities, the open synergies opportunity. So how should we just think about the margins, just for the fourth quarter and then going forward?","Tom Hirsch","Yeah, we are not going to get into fourth quarter quarterly guidance. We are comfortable with our guidance for the full year, and I think as Jeff and Mark have kind of highlighted, we have very good visibility and are continuing to grow margins in both of our operating segments through a combination of scaling of our newer solutions, continued growth in our operational effectiveness and really our business model, which we believe is really a differentiator, as far as both the differentiator of our solutions, and continuing to focus on high quality revenue in both segments; i.e., scaling of revenue inside our businesses, both in the core account processing segment and also on our payment segment on our larger businesses. So that's a key to drive that growth, and we ensure that our revenue goals is coming from those high quality sources, which allows for margin expansion and kind of free cash flow growth, and those are really the drivers of what we see going forward, and that should continue.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","That's good. Thanks for taking the question.","Tom Hirsch","Thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you. And thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect from the audio portion."],"9353":["Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 29, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Stephanie Gregor","Jeffery W.

Please contact our Investor Relations team if you need any additional information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Stephanie, and welcome on your inaugural call. Good afternoon, everyone, on the phone. Results for the quarter were solid, building off our very strong second quarter and in line with our full year expectations. Momentum continued to build as new recurring revenue came online, sales were strong and pipelines expanded measurably. We're pleased with our results for the quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 10% in the quarter and is up 9% year-to-date. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter, led by 5% growth in the Payments segment and consistent with our expectations given the prior year compare and the strength of Q2. Adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points in the quarter and is up 50 basis points for the year.","The strong performance was driven primarily by high-quality recurring revenue growth, Operational Effectiveness savings and Open Solutions cost synergy attainment. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter, which benefited from higher operating earnings and a lower tax rate, increased 24% to $1.56. And for the first 9 months, is up 18% to $4.39. Free cash flow was exceptional in the quarter and through September 30, is up 25% to $4.47 per share. Comparable sales in the quarter, which exclude Open Solutions, were rock solid at 105% of quota. Actual sales in the quarter were up 13% versus the prior year, and our wins were heavily weighted to recurring revenue.","At the start of each year, we share our enterprise priorities to help you gauge our overall progress. Our 3 priorities are: First, to continue to build high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to extend market momentum into deeper client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and last, to deliver innovation and integration that enhances results for our clients with an important focus on Open Solutions.","We've made measurable progress against our first priority during the quarter. Internal revenue grew in the places we expected, including the bill payment business, which at 10% transaction growth was the highest quarter since 2008. Along with continuing solid performance in debit, mobile and our scale account processing businesses.","Our strong reported transaction growth in both debit and bill payment was somewhat muted by the consumer spending slowdowns seen by industry participants in September, which had the effect of lowering our revenue and transaction growth in the quarter. We have not seen this persist meaningfully into the fourth quarter.","Adjusted operating income grew 12% in the quarter and is up 11% year-to-date on the strength of high-quality revenue growth, operational efficiencies and the Open Solutions acquisition. These results have translated to excellent EPS and free cash flow to date, and we are well positioned for a strong finish to the year.","Our second priority is to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. We signed 136 new Mobiliti clients in the quarter and have added 324 year-to-date. The majority of our more than 1,700 Mobiliti clients are utilizing our ASP service, where the subscribers have increased by nearly 1 million through the third quarter and increased 21% sequentially.","We were excited to introduce our tablet ASP offering in the second quarter. Demand is growing rapidly and through September 30, we have signed 175 clients, which we expect to go live over the next several months. More and more financial institutions are looking to offer unique, mobile-based banking experiences to better serve their customers, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on this secular trend.","We're seeing meaningful acceleration in our win rate for core account processing solutions in the mid-tier bank market. In fact, the majority of the buying decisions over the last 18 months have been awarded to Fiserv. We also believe that DNA, to us through the Open acquisition, could further accelerate our opportunity to take share in this attractive market segment. Importantly, these institutions prefer to bundle significant content into these transactions, which benefits our suite of market-leading add-on solutions and boosts overall revenue growth. We'll share more about this important shift at Investor Day.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration for our clients with an important focus on Open Solutions. We remain steadfast in our belief that the realtime movement of non-point of sale transactions is a unique opportunity for our financial institutions to deliver new value to their customers and increase their payments revenue. As such, we signed over 100 institutions for Popmoney Instant Payment in the third quarter alone and anticipate these clients will go live over the next couple of quarters. We're also enabling realtime in other areas, such as electronic bill payment. Same-day expedited bill payments are up more than 270% year-over-year. This will grow much more rapidly as we expand availability across our more than 1 billion annual bill payments, providing value to the end-user and extending the financial institution relationships with their customers.","The integration of Open Solutions continued at a rapid pace. We closed another 11 DNA wins in the quarter, the most in any quarter in more than 6 years. A number of the sales are larger, multiproduct license and outsource transactions, meaning these implementations will occur in 2014 and 2015, and as such, a substantial portion of this revenue is deferred into those periods.","Continuing strong demand for DNA is also evidenced in our late-stage pipeline, which is more than 5x larger than when we acquired the business. This growth shows the value of Open's DNA platform when combined with the leading integrated solutions and a strong delivery capability.","Client and prospect feedback remains very positive on Open Solutions. We continue to expect to exceed our original synergy goals, which are evidenced in our strong Operational Effectiveness and integrated sales results. We'll provide revised revenue and cost synergy estimates at our upcoming Investor Day.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail for the quarter.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 10% in the third quarter to $1.1 billion, and increased 9% in the first 9 months to $3.4 billion, both compared to the prior year periods. Adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% in the third quarter was within our expectations, given the difficult prior year's growth comparison and also the timing of license revenue, which benefited the second quarter's growth rate by approximately 1% and negatively impacted the third quarter growth rate by about 50 basis points.","At the same time, we had meaningful growth in high-quality recurring revenue in the quarter as absolute internal revenue grew by about 1% sequentially over the second quarter's level. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 24% to $1.56 on the strength of higher operating earnings and a lower tax rate. And is up 18% through September 30, to $4.39. Adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points in the quarter to 30.5% and is up 50 basis points for the year. We are very pleased with our margin performance, which is especially strong given the headwinds identified coming into the year.","Overall margin expansion was driven by excellent Operational Effectiveness results, Open synergies and high-quality revenue growth.","Now on to the segment results. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 5% in the quarter and 4% year-to-date, as compared to 2% in both last year's quarter and year-to-date. Strong payment volume, notwithstanding the September industry-wide slowdown, in our recurring revenue payments businesses such as card services and bill payment, primarily drove the increase. The internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 1% from lower license and services revenue, primarily related to large, international online banking implementations.","Bill payment transaction growth boosted by the ramp of prior year wins accelerated to 10% in the quarter and was up 3 percentage points sequentially. For those keeping score on our large bill payment wins, Regions Bank went live in the quarter.","E-bill transactions were up 5% for the third consecutive quarter. Debit transaction growth in the quarter of 16% was well above market. For the year-to-date, issuer transactions are up 14% compared to the prior year, and we have also added 101 new debit clients.","We continue to make progress with Popmoney. Transactions for the year, albeit on relatively small transaction volume, are up more than 80% versus the prior year. And we have also added over 200 new institutions to the network. We, and the more than 2,000 institutions who offer Popmoney today, remain bullish on the potential to electronify the billions of non-POS transactions that move in the person-to-person and small business ecosystem each year.","Payments segment operating income was up 4% in the quarter to $173 million and year-to-date operating income increased 8% to $518 million, all of which is organic. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was down 10 basis points in the quarter to 30.8%, largely from a 60 basis point negative impact in our investment services business, primarily from a client settlement. Still, segment operating margin for the year was up 100 basis points to 31.1%, driven by increased operating leverage in our scale businesses, including card services, bill payment and digital channels, partially offset by the revenue impact of the Bank of America bill payment renewal.","Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 14% to $585 million and $1.7 billion for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, primarily due to the acquisition of Open Solutions. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 1% in the quarter and is flat year-to-date. Solid revenue growth in our account processing businesses this year has been offset by a couple of percentage point drag from the unusual de-conversion of a large account processing client, which will anniversary late in the fourth quarter.","In addition, currency changes and lower onetime revenue had a 1 percentage point negative impact on segment growth in the quarter. As Jeff mentioned, sales of the DNA platform have been stellar and a number of those clients have selected outsource delivery. These transactions, which include a variety of products in addition to DNA, represent an important shift in the business model, which is being retooled to drive more high-value solutions to the client, but will also result in deferring more revenue than it has historically. That move towards recurring revenue, combined with the business losing fewer clients and, therefore, having lower termination fees, is a strong positive sign for the business, but is leading to less 2013 revenue in the business than originally anticipated.","We expect to exit the year with a large backlog of DNA business, much of which will go live in 2014. In addition, the revenue synergy opportunity is significant, with add-on total contract value or TCV in the qualified pipeline now approaching $300 million in TCV.","Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 19% in the quarter to $197 million. Adjusted operating margin increased by 160 basis points to 33.7% compared to the prior year, primarily related to scale efficiencies and Operational Effectiveness savings, including Open synergies. Year-to-date adjusted operating income in the segment was up 15% to $553 million and adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 32%.","The adjusted operating loss in the Corporate segment for the third quarter was $23 million, increasing by $1 million over the prior year and consistent with the first 2 quarters. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.5%, which is 150 basis points lower than our anticipated full year adjusted tax rate and down approximately 3 percentage points compared to the adjusted prior year period due to several discrete tax benefits. This provided a benefit in the quarter of approximately $0.03 per share compared to our anticipated 2013 full year rate and $0.07 per share compared to last year's third quarter.","Through September 30, our adjusted effective tax rate is down about 80 basis points to 34.4%. We expect the rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 36.5% and the full year rate to approximate 35%, which is at the lower end of our full year expectations. We continue to make solid progress in lowering our overall annual effective tax rate.","Free cash flow per share continues to be strong, growing 25% to $4.47 through September 30, primarily as a result of increased earnings and lower tax payments compared to the prior year.","Total debt at September 30 was just under $4 billion or 2.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. In late October, we raised $900 million in a new 5-year term loan with a similar interest rate as our existing $2 billion revolving credit facility. The proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolver, which is almost all related to the debt assumed in the Open Solutions transaction.","We repurchased 2 million shares of stock in the quarter for $192 million. Through September 30, we have allocated $463 million repurchasing 5.2 million shares at an average cost of $89.73 per share. There were 129.3 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter and 10.4 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Tom. As I mentioned upfront, sales, excluding Open Solutions, in the quarter were strong attaining 105% of quota and is 98% for the year. Sales in the quarter were led by strong performance in account processing, card services and output solutions. Sales performance through September 30 was up 11% versus last year's excellent performance, which included several very large bill payment wins. Our pipeline continues to grow, and we're optimistic that we will achieve our full year sales target.","Integrated sales were $64 million in the quarter and are $165 million through September 30, versus our $210 million annual target. Sales were strong across a broad range of our market-leading solutions, and as Tom mentioned earlier, our integrated sales pipeline related to the Open Solutions acquisition is expanding at a very rapid pace. We're on track to achieve our integrated sales objective for the year.","Our Operational Effectiveness goal for 2013 is $60 million, which includes the anticipated Open Solutions cost synergies. Through September 30, we've achieved $55 million of savings or 92% of our annual target, on the strength of Open cost synergy attainment and great execution of our Operational Effectiveness objectives. The market environment has remained generally consistent with the prior quarters, with the exception of the market uncertainty emanating out of Washington. Regulatory actions continue to be modest, with 10 in the third quarter and down to 35 year-to-date, a reduction of 33% compared to the same period last year and clearly, in the right direction.","We continue to see targeted M&A activity in the banking market as well. Our view of the technology spending landscape remains the same, with financial institutions focused on innovative solutions that can help them generate revenue, deal with an increasingly noisy and complex regulatory environment, and with a continuing focus on operational efficiency.","As I mentioned upfront, our results to date are in line with our expectations, and we're on track to achieve results within our full year targets. We've narrowed our adjusted EPS growth guidance to 17% to 19% or $5.94 to $6.02 per share, which biases our results for the year towards the upper end of our original EPS range. We expect adjusted revenue to increase by approximately 10% and adjusted internal revenue to increase by approximately 3% for the year. We expect fourth quarter adjusted internal revenue growth to be in a range of 4% to 5%, led by stronger growth in the Payments segment. We now expect adjusted operating margin to expand between 30 and 50 basis points for the full year. We expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating margin to be negatively impacted by about 50 basis points due to lower corporate expenses in last year's Q4.","And finally, we still expect free cash flow to increase by at least 18% for the year or greater than $6.55 per share.","In summary, we feel good about our performance and are focused on a strong finish to the year. We've made significant progress improving our growth profile through adding high-value recurring revenue, expanding our account processing footprint and driving very strong sales execution. The progress with Open Solutions, combined with good visibility into 2014, fuels our conviction that we will increase our internal revenue growth rate again next year. Lastly, we recognize that our success is attributable to the dedication of our thousands of associates who work together to deliver the best products, services and experience to our clients each and every day.","With that, Jenny, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have some questions in queue. Our first is from Mr. David Togut, Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Could you update us on unit pricing trends in the community bank and credit union market? And related to that, have you seen any change in competitive win rate?","Mark A. Ernst","Yes. David, this is Mark Ernst. Let me take that. What I think I would say is that, we're seeing relative stability in pricing, which is competitive, certainly. But we've not seen sort of degradation or greater kind of pricing pressure in either the bank market or the credit union market. More often than not, what we're seeing is that, we and all of our competitors are kind of in much of in the same range around pricing, and it really ends up turning on feature function, the kind of state-of-the-art of the technology and very importantly, the surround solutions that each of us is bringing to the market is the final kind of thing that determines the success or failure of any one -- in any one particular case. We have -- as was noted in the comments, we've seen good momentum in the bank market, particularly in the mid-market bank market, and we're going to talk more about that at Investor Day. But we're pretty pleased with the way in which our various solutions are mixing together and kind of the momentum that we are experiencing in the market. On the credit union side, that is clearly a market that's very much in transition. The DNA product and how we are now bringing that to market has very much changed the dynamic of the overall market and the win rates that we're experiencing. So I think it's a little bit unsettled at the moment, but we're very pleased with the kind of progress that we're seeing in competitive situations out in the credit union space.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just related to that, Mark, what has been the messaging to your clients about the conversion to DNA and the large credit union market in terms of timeline?","Mark A. Ernst","Well, so it depends on the kind of the point at which we've been in those discussions. But generally speaking, we are looking at a 12- to 18-month implementation period at this point, which for most of our large credit union prospects and clients, that's consistent with both what they will have to do internally and their ability to do that conversion. The DNA product, unlike some other products in the market, the DNA product is actually, fairly efficient to take into a new situation because of its flexibility. So we've -- and clearly, we have beefed up our conversion capacity in that platform to address the demand. So we're feeling pretty good about both, not just what's going on in the pipeline, as Jeff and Tom both referred to, but also our ability to convert that business as it comes on.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, David, I mean, just to punctuate that point, we have, really, since very early in the process looked to leverage some of the existing credit union expertise that we had across our system as a way to buttress the demand that we knew we would see. And frankly, the demand for the product has been even greater than we anticipated. However, it's very important to us to make sure that we have the right number of resources so that we can serve the market. We have slots available. We are not concerned about capacity because we've built ahead of that, and we're continuing to do that both on the -- frankly, on the credit union side, as well as on the bank side.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So embedded in your expectations for improving organic growth next year, how much of that pickup is coming from financial versus just an ongoing acceleration in the payments business?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean, I would say right now it is premature to be giving guidance and certainly premature to be giving guidance down to those levels. I mean, we'll share at Investor Day kind of our views of the market and where we see these things lining up. But on balance, we would expect to see improvement in both segments next year.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Quick final question for me, it looks like you're about to exceed your Operational Effectiveness target for the year. Since you're at 92% through the first 9 months, what do you expect cost savings to actually be when we reach the end of 2013? And then related to that, what's your cost takeout target for '14?","Thomas J. Hirsch","David, this is Tom. We'll be going over that clearly on Investor Day in December. We continue to make really good progress there and a combination of both of what we're doing internally and also with the Open synergy. So we continue to make progress. We're ahead of schedule from that standpoint in the current year. You can see that drop through in some of the Financial segment margins, et cetera. But we'll update you more on Investor Day, but we'll continue to have a good fourth quarter from that standpoint. I'm not going to give you an estimate for the year, but we'll continue to make good progress and then we'll give you an update on the Investor Day.","Operator","Our next question over the phone comes from Mr. Tien-tsin Huang.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess I just want to ask on -- just in general, in terms of backlog. It sounds like it's been building up, but any change in conversion rates and things like that? I heard the Regions piece came on board and Wells is still on track for next year. Any surprises in general?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So on -- are you talking about -- is that a more general question? Or is that...","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","General question, but I guess thinking more a little about some of the larger implementations that you've been talking about.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, absolutely. So as we mentioned, Regions came online. We did see a push in a couple of the larger deals that we had anticipated would go live in the fourth quarter have now gone into 2014. And then we're still on track for Wells to go live at the beginning of the year. So there is a little bit of a move between '13 and '14, where we would have -- we were anticipating a couple of clients to go in Q4. On the rest of the backlog, for the rest of the company, we aren't seeing -- we aren't seeing any pushes. And then frankly, those other 2 pushes have more to do with how these institutions are designing their new experiences as opposed to anything else. So we're actually hopeful that as those experiences come online and they're more differentiated given some of the trend toward Mobiliti that, in fact, that will actually be a plus to transaction volume.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. Okay, that's great to know. That's comforting to know. And then, I guess, I heard a little bit more about deferred revenue than usual here. I guess that maybe it's a revenue rec thing with DNA, but should be watching that deferred revenue line a little bit more? I thought it was up, what, 5.5%. Is that becoming more important?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think one of the things -- and Jeff and I kind of hit on it, regarding the deals that we're signing in that space, with DNA that used to be kind of a standalone-type license product with a lot of kind of resale from other third-party vendors. Now what's happening is, it's clearly getting bundled with our integrated solution set of card, bill payment, online banking and everything else. So there is revenue that gets recognized over a much longer extended period of time because those implementations are clearly farther out. So that's really the kind of the change that we're kind of seeing from what maybe Open had previously versus what we're experiencing today because that revenue now gets deferred. It's larger from an outsourcing standpoint. And so it's just really a higher backlog as we kind of go into '14 and into '15.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, and Tien-tsin, I would say that it is less -- we don't anticipate changes in our model that will end up having more and more revenue deferred. This is really a change from kind of Open historical to Open as part of Fiserv, which should cleanse itself as we move -- as we kind of anniversary the transaction at the end of January next year. You'll have a little bit of an edge on growth, but it's really much more around the conversion to our practices and our model.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Very, clear. Very clear. I misunderstood before. I apologize. Just last one, just to Open synergies, just any change in thinking there around the revenue expense synergy? I know, Jeff, you've been pretty upbeat about that, any change?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, the only thing -- I'll start with that and then turn it over to Jeff -- is that I think we highlighted that the pipeline on the add-on revenue for Open has built to approximately $300 million in total contract value, and that's just from the add-on products. So we're very pleased with the buildup of that particular pipeline, and very -- I'll go into more depth on that on Investor Day -- also just a number of different products that we built there. We're very satisfied, obviously, with the wins in DNA from that standpoint. And regarding the expense side, we continue to be ahead of where we anticipated to be. You can kind of see that in our Operational Effectiveness savings that continue to drive good cost synergies from that standpoint.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I would say that one of the unique characteristics of this acquisition was, we didn't have the benefit of the normal pre-close integration planning period. And so, some of what we've learned during this time, we would have learned in that preplanning period. And literally, I would say that, even in this quarter, I became and I think we became more bullish on the revenue synergy opportunities as we're now starting to understand not just what can we do with our normal add-on products, but Open did not have a very sophisticated product management methodology. We've got a number of other products that we believe we can add on that are really more componentized around the core solution, not just things like debit and bill pay, Mobiliti, Corillian, and those kind of things that we're, obviously, proud of, but even some of these fundamental aspects of their business model that we're going to be able to hopefully deliver to their more than 800 core clients that sit on things like DNA alone. So we're quite excited about that.","Operator","Our next question over the phone comes from Mr. Darrin Peller, Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Let me just start off, lower license fees, I think you mentioned in service revenue from a -- I think it was an online banking client led to 1 point of pressure on year-over-year growth for payments. But when you look at last quarter's 7% growth rate and seeing even better trends in bill pay now from your metrics, and I think debit also and then Regions coming on for bill pay, I'm just wondering what led to the deceleration in the segment, the Payments segment from the 7% growth range last quarter? And then just, can you give us a little sense of adding back 1 point, should we expect to get back to that 7% again?","Thomas J. Hirsch","That's a great question, Darrin. And what I would say is, our Payments segment growth rate, as you know, was 5% in the quarter, and we came off a very strong second quarter. And as I think you know, a 1% change on a quarterly basis is roughly about $5 million of rev. And as you know, right, we have a number of different businesses in this particular segment. Bill pay and card make up a chunk of revenue in here, but we have a number of different businesses. And so we saw very strong growth in our recurring revenue businesses, bill pay and card services as we talked about. We did have a 1% negative impact. We have a large online banking business in this particular segment. And we did see some declines in services revenue that impacted the third quarter rate by about 1%. It did positively impact the second quarter rate by a couple of million dollars, but that sort of swing can kind of move the number around on a quarterly basis. But we're in very good shape from a standpoint of a go-forward standpoint. The bill payment metrics are solid and our card services metrics are solid. So while the rate might move around slightly from quarter-to-quarter, those recurring revenues are positioned very nice as we go into the fourth quarter and, obviously, into 2014.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. So I mean, when you think about the -- and when you combine that with just another question on the headwinds on the financial side, just remind the timing around those and how much they equate there? I think, if I remember correctly, that was on -- I know that had an impact on the margin profile of the year, but when do we anniversary? And what can that mean for margins?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think the -- I think what you're talking about is when we entered the year, I think we said we had about $50 million of headwind, a combination of the Bank of America renewal pricing, which hits our Payments segment on a quarterly basis and a combination of this unusual de-conversion of a large core account processing client. So those anniversary at the end of December. And so as we head into 2014, clearly, that's going to positively impact us from a Financial segment standpoint and also somewhat in the Payments segment.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Right, because we also have, Darrin, as you know, right, we're still moving past the revenue impact from the Bank of America...","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Pricing change.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, which is combined for those 2.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. All right. Just one last kind of high-level question, maybe Jeff, maybe you can help me with this. We received some questions around your Popmoney initiative. It sounds like you're actually signing a lot more institutions there, but, obviously, with some more emerging payments players announcing different initiatives around cash remittance for free in the U.S. What are your thoughts there? I mean, is that a business that is going to be too competitive? Or is that really still a very big opportunity longer term?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean, there have been a number of announcements over the last -- certainly, over the last several months. A good share of them have to do with kind of the war at point-of-sale and then there are several that also are picking up on the fringes of moving money around, kind of the non-POS side, which is where we see Popmoney. The challenge that those providers have is they're not part of a bank-centric or a financial institution-centric network. And I just have a hard time believing that a non-financial institution-centric network is the winning solution. Popmoney, obviously, has the largest footprint in the U.S. By adding on the realtime, kind of what we call Popmoney Instant Payments right now, but that realtime edge really is, I believe, the game changing piece, both in terms of consumer to consumer, but also consumer to small business, small business to small business, in terms of -- really, the smaller businesses, right, the 24 million or so very small businesses in the U.S. So I do believe that, that ecosystem ends up being financial institution-centric. I think Popmoney has a very good possibility of being the primary way in which that happens. And we're quite bullish on that. And as instant, even I think in this -- in today, we talked about 80% growth year-over-year. And so we're seeing good growth. The numbers are small. And the bill payment numbers were small at some point as well. And I do believe that the opportunities to move money are multiples of what they were on the bill payment side. So we're still bullish on this. I still think there's a lot to figure out. But we built the network, and we're now spending our time on how can we actually get the money to move and move adoption.","Mark A. Ernst","The one thing that I would add to that is, we clearly in all of our research, and I think all the indications of the market continue to see that consumers respond best when this is done through their financial institution. The confidence they have of dealing with their own financial institution is a key enabler that allows people to have the confidence to use this kind of a service.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. David Koning, Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And so I guess my first question, just the financial margin, I think was the highest it's ever been, which is really encouraging given you just integrated Open Solutions recently. And I think you mentioned that license revenue hurt, I think, the total company by about 50 bps year-over-year in terms of revenue. So I'm just wondering, given license maybe wasn't quite as strong as some other quarters, maybe why financial margins were so strong and is this level sustainable going forward?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think, Dave, the biggest thing that we have in that particular segment going on is clearly our Operational Effectiveness initiative. I think we're way ahead from a standpoint of what we've generated in that particular initiative in the company, and we've made really good progress. That's a combination both of Open synergies and also the other Operational Effectiveness. And that's been really the big driver. And a lot of that is sustainability as we kind of go forward. So while we're always going to have different things that mix in, we definitely had a good quarter there. And to your point, from a company standpoint, our license revenue was actually down 50 basis points and our termination fees were flat. So we didn't get any benefit from that either in the quarter. And so good there. And then I would also say that, as you know, in our account processing business, we have good scale there. Our check processing business, we continue to maximize the margin profile of that business. And so we've really worked hard in that segment to continue to drive through and -- so we have some things that move around the quarter, but we've made really good progress there.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And I guess just one follow-up question, I think your acquired revenue, you gave a metric on that, I think it was $69 million or somewhere around there. The last couple of quarters, it had been closer to maybe high-70s, around $80 million. And maybe what, I guess sequentially was there something at Open that fell off a little bit or maybe you could just walk through that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, David, I'll grab that and let Tom add on. As we were actually mentioning with Tien-tsin a bit, we have had some of these. As we move Open into the Fiserv family, we've got 3 or 4 areas in which we're seeing some changes. The business model item that we were talking about as we have larger transactions, more outsourced transactions and actually, the size of the transactions that we've been doing with DNA so far are -- as we got to the end of September, we were 4x larger than their -- on a total contract value basis, 4x larger for DNA than their entire year last year. So these are larger transactions. They take larger to implement. The revenue as you know well because you know the business so well. The revenue that they were recognizing or seeing in the first couple of quarters of the year had everything to do with what was sold last year, right? So those came in. So that's one of the items. The second item, frankly, is that we're actually seeing lower termination fees. We expect to actually have lower termination fees. The good news on that is, we're losing a lot less clients. Open lost roughly 80 clients in 2011, 30 clients in '12, and we estimate only about 10 this year. And so that's good news on one hand because we're keeping those clients. On the other hand, termination revenue, we actually expect to be down $8 million to $10 million in the second half of the year. So again, it's kind of a little bit of a short-term hit, but not -- great for us over the longer haul. The other big point I want to mention is really around reseller revenue. And that is, as you know, DNA had reseller relationships all over the place, both in terms of selling DNA, but also selling other products, such as EFT and the like. And so on the reseller, the core reseller bases with DNA, we actually terminated almost all of those relationships. We don't need any help selling the product. We're doing a great job so far. But there is a hit as that was -- a lot of the units came from resellers. We're seeing less coming in because ourselves cycles are longer because the sales are much larger sales. And then on the other side, we've exited several of the third-party add-on products in favor of our own products. And as Tom mentioned, there was about $300 million in total contract value in the pipe right now. But Open took that all in as revenue, and that revenue is now coming on at the same level that it was in the first half of the year. So those are really the big items that I would say are impacting the change in revenue quarter-to-quarter -- or sequentially quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mr. Brett Huff, Stephens, Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more about the competitive dynamic, specifically on the big credit union space. I know that's a pretty competitive space and the number of offerings there is kind of continuing to shrink. And you talked a little bit about it, but what is the driver of the win rates? Why are people choosing one product over another? Can you -- you mentioned that they were a little unsettled, but wanted to get a little bit more color on that.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean I -- let me give it a shot and perhaps Mark will add on to this. I mean, the larger end of the credit union space is -- there are only a couple of real alternatives in that space. And frankly, we have today the majority of the share as it relates to any single competitor. We actually have more share than any other competitors -- or any of our competitors spread across multiple different platforms. And a couple of years ago, we made a decision that we would have -- that a couple of our platforms would end up being sunset. And as you well know, when you do that, you put clients up for bid. At that same time, we also made a determination that we would bring Acumen to market. We had a lot of success with Acumen in a short period of time, and then we bought Open Solution. So I would say that on one hand, we've had a little bit of turmoil in our own credit union base. That's now been quieted down by DNA for when people make a choice between DNA and the other competitors, I mean, DNA is really by far the most technologically advanced solution in the market. They were disadvantaged over time because of their financial condition and the lack of surround solutions. That's gone away. We're having a lot of success there. But frankly, we compete with some good competitors, and we haven't won all the deals. We'd like to have won them all, but we have not. And as we've gotten more entrenched in with DNA, and we've made it very, very clear within our base that the solutions that we are operating today are go-forward solutions, we've been able to shut that back door down. So I'm actually quite confident that over the next 6, 12, 18 months, that we will see a very dynamic shift in the market. And that, frankly, we will see DNA and some of our other solutions end up gaining share in this market.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Just one follow-up, I think you also referred to maybe the new -- it sounds like you're selling more of these on a -- not a perpetual license, but I don't want to call it SaaS, but an ongoing license. Is that part of the change as well in terms of how you're bringing this to market?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","You're talking about DNA, Brett?","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean, DNA, let me be -- we should use something other than perpetual license. But DNA is really kind of -- was built by a series of software engineers. So the core culture of that business was really around being a software shop. And so they provided outsourced services more as an accommodation. That changed over the last several years. So they built up some outsource capability. We, in Fiserv, right, that is the very essence of what we do, so we're putting a lot more energy into that. And so the shift from kind of traditional, \"Let's sell a license. Give it to the folks and let them install it, and then we'll collect our maintenance every year.\" That's a very different model than we're interested in. I mean, we're happy to do license deals, and we've done actually a number of license deals this year. But it's a different culture, a different velocity, more add-on products and frankly, a different kind of relationship. So that is creating the timing thing that we were talking about earlier. We expect that as we anniversary the transaction that, that will change. But for now, it really is one of the reasons why we're not seeing the benefit of the sales, where traditionally they would have been recognizing or we -- the former Open organization would have been recognizing more license revenue that we are at this point.","Mark A. Ernst","And just to be clear also, the market prefers the outsource model. That's not to say that there aren't license sale opportunities, but we are biasing toward where the market wants to be, and outsourced is a -- very much a preferred part of it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","That's a great point, Mark. I mean, typically on a year in and year out basis, 70% of the decisions are on an outsourced basis.","Operator","And our next question over the phone comes from Mr. Chris Shutler, William Blair & Company.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So on the $300 million of CV that you mentioned and given the other comments in the Q&A on the 12- to 18-month implementation timeline for Open or for DNA, I just wanted to clarify that we should interpret that as meaning that by kind of early-to-mid '15, we should see the vast majority of that CV actually beginning to hit the P&L?","Mark A. Ernst","I think we've got to distinguish, those are 2 different things. We have a pipeline of transactions that are in process now that are being taken to implementation. The $300 million backlog, if you will, or pipeline, is really a late stage sales pipeline that is not yet sold. So I would say that those are 2 distinctly different things.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, got you.","Thomas J. Hirsch","And Chris, as you know, a lot of that is our add-on propriety products, right? So you take a debit deal, right, that deal could start up, implement in a year, it could implement in 2 years and then it be debit, that processing contract will be for 5 years. So there's a variety of things that are in that add-on pipeline. But I think our point is, and what Mark referred to is that, we're surprised at how fast that total pipeline has built up because those are sales just into the existing Open client base, with those proprietary add-on products. And it's a number of those, probably about 15 different ones that we have inside of Fiserv.","Mark A. Ernst","And that $300 million is in addition to the sales success that we're reporting already with DNA.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And just the other one, Jeff, just wanted to get your latest thoughts on the whole bank versus biller debate in the bill pay business. I've seen some comments recently which would indicate that younger generations are increasingly gravitating towards the biller channel, not the bank channel. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts there.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, Chris. I mean, I do -- we see this and do believe that the biller experience, right, on a one-off, I want to quickly pay a bill because they have the content there, right, if I need to go to a biller site, they'll tell me how much I have to pay. I mean, there's certainly a move there. And I think it's around -- and it's about a 50-50 split today between aggregator or bank and biller. And in fact, one of the things that we'll talk about at Investor Day are some changes that we are looking at and implementing to bring more content to bear and an enhanced experience for attracting these folks that maybe occasionally go to biller direct, as well as we see a large amount of the population who is not paying bills at the level we would like. And so we'd see, of the 24 million or 25 million, 26 million bill pay makers, users that we have today, we see a lot of opportunity to expand that base as well. The other piece that we cannot overlook in the value proposition, the biggest differentiation in the value proposition between biller and bank over time has been the ability to post payments same day. And one of the reasons why I mentioned that our same-day payments are up 270%, more than 270% year-over-year is we're building this non-POS realtime network to bring those capabilities against the 1 billion or so payments that we have today. But frankly, there is an equal or equivalent number of payments that aren't making it into our system. And we think that increases the value proposition very importantly. And again, we'll talk more about that at Investor Day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Peter Heckmann, Avondale.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","My questions have been answered, but I want to follow up in case I missed it, did you comment on how the new term loan will affect your weighted average cost of debt?","Thomas J. Hirsch","It won't change a lot because the interest rate is very similar to our revolver. I think the thing that does, Pete, is it just frees up -- it extends the maturity out 5 years on that. And then also, it just frees up the capacity on our credit facility.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one thing I've been meaning to ask about and maybe you'll talk about it at the Investor Day, but the investment services business, can you remind us roughly how big that business is and if it's generating revenue on a per account basis or as a percentage of assets under administration?","Mark A. Ernst","Yes, it is about $150 million business for us, but it generates it on a per account basis.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay, per account. So you haven't seen a real benefit from the market action to date?","Mark A. Ernst","There's certainly a correlation because, as -- as the markets build, we are seeing more and more consumers moving towards the kinds of products that we support in that business. And the -- so we have seen some tailwind, but it's more muted than just sort of the run-up in assets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Kartik Mehta, Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","I wanted to ask you, Jeff, a little bit about Popmoney. You were seeing, as you've mentioned throughout the call, some additional companies trying to get into the P2P business, more advertising, when do you think this business gets scale? I'm assuming you think there's going to be some type of an event that gives it a hockey stick kind of growth. As you look at the business and kind of analyze it, when do you think that happens?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean it would be overly assertive for me to give the timeframe, plus I suspect that there's little probability that I'll get it right enough for this kind of a dialogue. What I will say is, we spend a lot of time looking at the bill payment model and what happened -- if you think about what happened in the old CheckFree business, right, that business had to gain momentum by kind of some internal points, as well as some external points. And the big-ticket item there was Bank of America's willingness to go out into the market not to charge fees, and it created a lot of momentum, right, so it kind of call it a tipping point. And then lots and lots of institutions wanted to sign up. The position that we've taken is, let's build the size of the network. Let's plant as many flags as we can. We have over 2,000 institutions in the network and then build the capabilities beyond the 1 to 2-day kind of movement capability. So bring in realtime and those kinds of things. I believe the tipping point will be created by the utilization of 2 things, by the utilization of realtime, so the ability to move money kind of on an instantaneous, right now basis. And number two, I think the role of request is quite important in that. So kind of having that network capability, sending and receiving different messages. I believe those are 2 of the factors that will make it happen. And I would tell you that I continue to believe that this business should be very, very significant in the -- kind of in the scope of the number of transactions and, therefore, the impact on Fiserv. So again, we'll talk about that at Investor Day, but believe it's a very big opportunity, not just for us, but actually bigger for financial institutions who really need to look to create new streams of revenue, of which the ability to move money on an instantaneous basis is, I think, a critical important opportunity for them.","Mark A. Ernst","The only other thing I'm going to add to that is, you asked about this relative to startups because we've all seen a couple of different names that are out there of firms trying to essentially kind of get into this business. The key thing that they will struggle with is consumer enrollment. And that's why the financial institution-centric model that we have that allows the customer in many cases to be known at the enrollment stage is an important differentiator relative to a lot of these startups.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just on the other side, Jeff -- your customers, the banks, are under cost pressure, they're under revenue pressure, is that in anyway slowing down the adoption of some of this technology whether it's P2P or mobile? Any concerns by your customers to say, we need to slow that down?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","No. I mean, I'll tell you, there are concerns by our customers and, in fact, I don't want to limit it our customers. I mean, there's a concern in the industry overall that the cost pressures, right, of deploying new technology are causing people to have to make choices around what technology to deploy, how to deploy it, but also that's coupled really with the revenue pressure that's out there. So the discussions are there, but I haven't run into a single institution of any size who doesn't understand that this is just the price of admission currently and, therefore, these kinds of technologies have to be there. And again, my confidence remains high because I can see every month institutions signing up for Popmoney. I can see institutions going mobile. And we've increased the number of Mobiliti ASP users by nearly 1 million so -- in this year alone. So that's out there. That's not going to stop. But we have to look for how can we drive more value for the financial institutions and, therefore, more value for the end customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citigroup Investment Research.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So my question is with regards to the gap between sales growth and revenue growth, which seems to sort of stay reasonably static at a fairly high level. And while that's going on, you do seem to indicate a reasonable year-over-year acceleration in the internal growth rate. So I'm trying to understand, why does that -- over time, you guys have double-digit sales growth, but it doesn't probably flow through to anything but very slow acceleration in internal growth rate of revenue?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, that's a great question. And believe me, we talk about that on a very regular basis. It is -- the big factors in that are, we're selling larger deals that take larger -- they longer time to implement. They are more complicated. And so -- and these transactions, which are on the basis of total contract value, are multiple years of contract value. And frankly, there are times when things, as we talked about in the call earlier today, a couple of implementations will slip from year-to-year. You've got those risks. So you have long implementation horizons and then things can slip. There's too much regulatory, so we're going to push this. We can't implement it. So you've got things like that going on. But probably the biggest factor is, and this has been interesting for me and my time here to learn is that, as much as we would like to have it differently, high-quality recurring revenue moves on your books slowly. And it builds slowly. And it comes off slowly, unless you have some kind of an exogenous event. So as difficult as it can be at times for us to understand why we have to have -- or I'm sorry, why our sales growth is so high and it does lead to acceleration in recurring revenue, but probably not at the pace we would certainly like it to be is, that is one of the costs of having a business that has high-quality revenue, high-quality margins and frankly, very, very strong client relationships. So that is something that we are dealing with in terms of, frankly, increasing our expectations. Each year, when we talk about sales quota, that quota goes up every year. And so we are asking our sales forces to sell more. But again, you need this multiple years of strong sales to turn into that escalating growth. One of the reasons, frankly, why we can say -- we can make a statement like we have a high degree of confidence that we'll be able to see acceleration once again in our internal revenue growth is, we see the pipeline. We see what is pending implementation or pending go live, and therefore, because of how that revenue comes on, we have comfort that we would expect to see that happening again in '14.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I think I got it, but we could potentially pursue that further when we meet. My other question is just clarification on software license. Are you -- am I to understand you guys are deemphasizing that broadly or what are your comments on software license, are sales limited to the accounting-related impact of Open, DNA and all the others?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thank you for asking that question. For clarity, we are in no way deemphasizing license revenue. We have some businesses that, that's really all of their revenues. So we are not doing that at all. We were really talking specifically about the Open Solutions business and the shift in their model, right, because it was very much a license-centric model. So that was the first part of it. And then second thing that Mark alluded to is that the market in many cases prefers an outsource solution over a license solution. And our job is, of course, to deliver what the market needs. But we are not deemphasizing that in any way. And in fact, it will continue to be an important part of our business over time.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Absolutely. The only thing I'd add to that, Ashwin, is that license revenue, right, is about 4% to 5% of our total revenues. And it can move around quarter-to-quarter. And what I said is that, in the second quarter, our growth rate, as you know, was 4%. It was 3% in the third quarter. And we had a benefit of license fees due to timing about 1% in the second quarter and then we had about 0.5% degradation in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. So the reason we bring that up is to let you know that, that's why that internal growth rate can move around quarter-to-quarter, over time it evens out. But again, it's 4% to 5% of our revenues. And as Jeff indicated, a very important part of our revenue stream. Even though we do see customers, as Mark indicated earlier, continuing to like the outsource model in many cases, but that is still an important part of our revenue stream.","Operator","And our last and final question comes from Mr. Ramsey El-Assal, Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I wanted to clarify something you said earlier, and I may have misunderstood your comments, but I wanted to -- you mentioned that bill pay transactions grew 10% in the quarter, debit and mobile transaction growth was also up, at the same time consumer spending slowed down, sort of muted overall results. I wanted to kind of reconcile these 2 items to kind of get a better idea of how a consumer slowdown kind of impacts you guys. In other words, if it doesn't manifest itself in lower transaction counts, is it lower tickets or is it just that I missed that there were lower transaction counts in other segments that offset the gains in the ones you mentioned?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, that's a great question. The point we were making was, is that even though we had 10% growth in bill pay, for example, we could see payments -- the payment patterns changing during the month of September. And therefore, that 10% was actually impacted by what we saw happening at the end of the quarter. And so -- but for that, and I think we used the term somewhat muted, but for that we would've actually seen higher levels of bill payment and higher levels of debit card usage.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned that you're not -- that, that was a kind of a fleeting softness that you saw and now that sort of corrected itself going to this quarter?","Mark A. Ernst","That is what we said. I would just caution, we're very watchful of that because of all the kind of noise that's going on in the economy. And sort of the consumer information. That September experience caught us a little bit by surprise. We didn't anticipate that, that was happening. And as Jeff said, in the comments, we didn't see that continue into October. But we're watchful of whether there's something unusual going on in the market, consumer side of the market that would affect some of these businesses.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean our uninformed, uneducated guess because we've seen this happen before is, there is some corollary to the amount of dysfunction that is occurring in Washington. And it has a real impact on how consumers pay bills and how they spend. Again, we had very strong transaction growth. We've done the analysis. We know it would have been -- it would've been better, and that -- we did not see that in the month of October. So that's the key.","Fantastic. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We know we went a little bit long. But if you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to call our Investor Relations group. Have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."],"9577":["Fiserv, Inc.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Paul Seamon - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives, the impact from tax reform, and the accounting changes in ASC 606.","Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons.","All of the share and per share amounts in the press release supplemental materials and our comments are adjusted for our two-for-one stock split completed on March 19. And also the 2017 full year adjusted EPS has been revised for the impact of the completion of the sale of the majority interest of our Lending Solutions business.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone.","We're pleased with our start to the year, achieving solid financial results for the quarter, slightly above our internal plan; strong adjusted EPS; and an increase in our client advocacy and experience measures. We are on track to achieve our strategic and financial commitments for the year.","Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter, even on lower periodic revenue. Adjusted operating margin was flat, and adjusted earnings per share was up a strong 23%. Market momentum continued, kicking off 2018 with sales up 12% versus the prior year. We also received approximately $470 million of proceeds from two business sales closing in the quarter; the 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business and retail voucher business acquired with Monitise. We expected to deploy this capital consistent with our longstanding allocation methodology.","Two weeks ago, we held our annual client conference, Fiserv Forum. With more than 4,400 in attendance this year, Forum is a place for financial executives to explore the latest technology trends, experience our leading edge solutions, and connect across hundreds of unique educational and networking sessions. We also hosted a record 270 prospect attendees during Forum, which reinforces the momentum we are experiencing across our portfolio of innovative solutions.","We continue to advance the four corners of differentiation growth strategies shared at last year's Investor Day. Each corner, account processing, digital, payments and biller solutions, has meaningful vertical and horizontal growth opportunities, which we believe will lead to deeper client relationships, increased high-quality revenue, and even stronger free cash flow.","Earlier this year, we provided our key shareholder priorities for 2018 which are: First, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments. Next, enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. And third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.","We provided accelerated internal growth rate guidance this year, which assumed growth would generally increase throughout the year. Consistent with that guidance, we believe the 3% internal revenue growth in the quarter will be the low watermark for the year. Internal revenue growth led by 5% growth in the Payments segment was pressured by the expected reduction in periodic revenue across both segments versus the comparable quarter.","Adjusted operating margin of 32.5% was flat in the quarter. This result included approximately 160 basis points of margin pressure from the combination of lower periodic revenue, 2017 acquisitions and the divested Lending business. Adjusted earnings per share was up 23%, which includes the benefit of a lower corporate tax rate.","Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We continue to add new clients across our market-leading processing \u2013 account processing solutions. Our DNA platform had a great start, signing seven new clients in the quarter. We also expect nearly 30 clients to go live this year, which is a significant increase in the number of implementations. And of that, more than half the institutions have assets greater than $1 billion.","We also continue to have success with our Premier platform, which has the largest client base in the market. We are pleased to renew and extend our Premier relationship with UnitedHealthcare's Optum Bank, the country's largest provider of HSA accounts. We also signed Two River Community Bank with assets over $1 billion and a competitive takeaway that, in addition to account processing, included a full digital and payment suite with solutions such as Mobiliti, CheckFree RXP and Notifi.","We continue to progress our new integrated biller strategy, which includes enabling some of the largest billers in the country with our payment solutions. During the quarter, we signed WellCare Health Plans, a provider of government sponsored managed care services with over four million members, to a bundle of omni-channel payments products headlined by our BillMatrix solution. We renewed our walk-in bill payment partnership with Walmart, which allows their customers to pay bills at thousands of Walmart locations across the country.","Digital continues to transform from technology to a mindset. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 25% in the quarter and 7% sequentially to more than seven million. Mobiliti business users expanded over 50% as commercial capabilities also continue to move up the digital value chain.","Given the size of our client base and early stages of adoption, we continue to anticipate strong subscriber and transaction growth across our digital suite for the foreseeable future. We've launched a number of solutions, such as CardValet and SecureNow, which create differentiated customer value at the intersection of payments and digital experience. These solutions leverage our digital rails and enhance our long-term recurring revenue.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. We, along with the financial industry, continue to focus on Zelle, which is driving new clients and strong transaction growth. Zelle transactions increased more than 80% sequentially in the quarter. We signed two top 35 banks to our turnkey Zelle solution, Synchrony Financial with assets over $95 billion and Zions Bancorporation with assets of over $66 billion.","Including these two signings, we're contracted to provide Zelle to 10 of the top 35 banks and still have headroom to meaningfully expand the size of our network. We're pleased to announce that Navy Federal Credit Union, the largest credit union in the world with over $90 billion in assets, has also selected our turnkey Zelle solution. So far, including Navy Federal, we've signed three of the five largest credit unions in the country as full Zelle clients.","Overall, we believe Zelle is more than a solution. It is a strong statement that financial institutions will continue to own money movement. We're excited to play a key role in this fundamental enabling capability.","Our newest enterprise payment solution, Dovetail, continues to generate significant interest as financial institutions look to modernize the payments infrastructure. On the strength of Dovetail, Fiserv was recently recognized by Aite Group as having moved into a market-leading position in payments hub technology. Estimates are that about half of the top 100 U.S. institutions have selected a solution which leave significant runway for growth both in the U. S. and around the world.","Commercial Center, our sophisticated digital commercial cash management solution acquired last year anniversaried in the quarter. Since owning the business we've added 29 new clients, nearly five times the clients that were sold in the prior year. As important, the Commercial Center pipeline remains multiples above where it was when we closed the acquisition.","In Australia, the New Payments Platform, or NPP for short, was launched in February. Fiserv, Swift and Australian financial institutions collaboratively designed the addressing service, including PayID. NPP is a real transformation for Australian consumers, corporates and government agencies, providing them the ability to conveniently send and receive real-time payments 24\/7 nationwide.","Finally, we were recognized as the most creative application of voice technology at the PYMNTS.com Alexa Awards in April. Our solution turns everyday banking tasks, such as balance inquiry, into a voice conversation with Alexa. Designed with advanced AI capabilities, our solution makes banking easier for consumers with features such as bill payment reminders.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.","As you know, this quarter we adopted ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard using the modified retrospective transition approach, and accordingly did not restate our prior period financial statements. In each 10-Q for 2018, we will include additional disclosure related to the impact of new standard on our financial statements.","As shared previously, we do not believe the cumulative full year impact of these changes will be material to our financial results. However, we do expect a bit more quarterly variation during this year than we've seen in the past for some of the revenue lines.","For comparative purposes, had we elected to restate the prior year periods under the new standard instead of using the retrospective approach, our internal revenue growth rate for the quarter would have been 4%. Adjusted revenue was $1.4 billion, up 4% in the quarter, and internal revenue growth was 3%. Solid execution drove our internal revenue growth for the first quarter even with periodic revenue down $9 million on an expected difficult quarterly comparison. As Jeff mentioned, we continue to expect internal revenue growth to accelerate during the year.","Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 23% to $0.76. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was flat compared to the prior year due to combined impact of 160 basis points from lower margin related to 2017 acquisitions, a decline in periodic revenue, and lower performance from our now divested Lending business.","Payments segment internal revenue growth was 5%, while adjusted revenue grew 7% to $770 million. Performance in the quarter was led by strong results from our Card Services and Biller Solutions businesses. Debit transaction growth in the quarter was in the mid single-digits and P2P transactions grew more than 20% year-over-year. We had over 80% sequential quarterly growth in Zelle transactions, and believe the rapid growth will continue as more clients and consumers adopt Zelle.","Mobile banking continues to perform very well as Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 7% sequentially and 25% year-over-year to 7.2 million. Architect, our market-leading digital platform serving retail and small business customers, continues to grow as nearly 40 clients are slated to go live this year.","Our Payments segment adjusted operating income was up 5% to $272 million in the quarter; and adjusted operating margin was down 80 basis points to 35.4%, due primarily to the dilutive impact of acquisitions which compress the segment margin by 110 basis points.","Financial segment adjusted revenue of $616 million was down slightly for the quarter. This was due primarily to the divestiture of the Australian item processing business last year and lower growth in our Lending business which was divested late in the quarter. Internal revenue growth in the segment was 1%, led by our account and item processing businesses, offset by a decline in periodic revenue.","Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 3% to $202 million. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 120 basis points to 32.8%, due to continued focus on operational effectiveness and higher quality revenue drop-through despite lower periodic revenue in the segment.","Corporate adjusted operating loss was up 11% in the quarter, and this increase was due to an unplanned litigation expense outside the U.S. We expect the full year corporate segment loss to be up slightly versus 2017.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%, largely due to a federal income tax rate reduction and the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation. As with last year, we anticipate the excess benefit to be frontloaded due to the timing of option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units. We continue to expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate of 22% to 23%.","Free cash flow in the quarter was $316 million, down slightly from last year's, due to timing of working capital. Free cash flow conversion in the quarter was 98%, which we expect to improve throughout the remainder of the year. As Jeff mentioned, free cash flow does not include the nearly $470 million of proceeds received from the business divestitures in the quarter.","Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.6 billion or 2.1 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. The decline in our debt-to-EBITDA ratio from the year-end level is due primarily to the receipt of the Lending Transaction proceeds late in the quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we intend to deploy these proceeds consistent with our longstanding capital allocation methodology.","And along those lines, we returned $398 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of 5.7 million shares. As of March 31, there were 411 million shares outstanding and 15.8 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Even after a strong Q4, sales were up 12% in the quarter and sales quota attainment was 92%, our strongest first quarter attainment since 2014. Sales performance was led by a number of solution areas including digital, biller and commercial services. The domestic pipeline remains very healthy, up 20% at quarter's end, and positions us for a strong sales year. Integrated sales were also excellent, increasing 19% to $61 million in the quarter.","We're off to a very good start in year three of our five-year operational effectiveness program, achieving $18 million of savings in the quarter, with strong labor optimization and procurement benefits. We expect to achieve our $50 million objective for the year, and have begun preliminary planning for the coming phase 4, which we believe will show significant opportunity.","We continue to sense optimism in the overall financial market on the strength of rising rates, benign loan losses and hopefulness around the regulatory environment. As digital is accepted as an idea that is here to stay, an increasing number of institutions are exploring ways to use the platform as a more proactive growth lever than we've seen before.","Given the current environmental backdrop, we would expect to see technology spend continue to increase as institutions look for ways to update their back office, bring enhanced capabilities to customers and, equally important, invest in risk, fraud and cyber security to further ensure safety and security in an ever complex financial system.","Lastly, around the environment. The number and depth of conversations around payments modernization continues to be significant. I'm quite bullish that this trend will lead to more opportunities, including the delivery of new solutions to address the emerging real-time payments ecosystem over the mid to long-term.","As I stated upfront, we're on track to achieve our financial goals for the year. We continue to expect a step-up of internal revenue growth to at least 4.5%, with rate acceleration throughout the year. We now expect adjusted EPS for the year to buy us above the midpoint of the split adjusted range of $3.02 to $3.15, which is growth of 22% to 27% over the $2.48 in 2017. We continue to anticipate that full year adjusted operating margin will expand between 10 basis points and 30 basis points, and that free cash flow conversion will be in the range of 106% to 111% for the full year.","In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year, making progress on our financial, operational and strategic objectives. We're well-positioned to achieve our financial goals while investing to drive client and shareholder value for the short, mid and long-term. Most important, I thank each of our 24,000 associates around the world who regularly go above and beyond to deliver Fiserv to our clients each day. You are the collective catalyst that makes us our very best.","With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","David?","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Jeff, could you comment on just the pace of conversions of the DNA product over the balance of the year? You had some very strong signings, both last year and the year before.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, it will bias, I would think, primarily to the second half of the year. We have a number of institutions starting to go live, and then the momentum will continue through December. And given the good start to the year, seven signings in Q1, we're feeling pretty good about the momentum that will carry into 2019 as well.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. And then, on the operational effectiveness target, it looks like you're well ahead of plan for this year, at least if we annualize the $18 million that you showed in Q1. Is there any reason why that annualized rate of savings should be different from what we saw in Q1?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. There will be some variability in that. It's not \u2013 it doesn't start at $18 million and necessarily move up. But I would say that we feel quite good about achieving our $50 million given the $18 million this quarter. And as I mentioned, we're starting to ramp our work up a little bit around phase 4 given where we are already in this existing phase. So, we're feeling good about that.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. And then, you announced a big hire recently to run your Card Services business, Kim Crawford Goodman. Does that signal a change in your ambitions for Card Services, intending to do anything bigger in that business?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, we're very happy to have Kim onboard. She's a strong experienced payments leader. We ended up having an opening in that business, and that business is a very important business to us. We're going to continue to make that as robust and as strong as we can.","And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a lot of interesting solutions emerging in the real-time \u2013 in the world of real-time money movement, and we think she's a, kind of, the right leader at the right time to help us deliver that.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. Quick final question. The $9 million year-over-year decline in periodic revenue, what was the breakdown there between a decline in contract term fees versus a decline in software revenue?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","The majority of the decline is actually driven by licenses in the quarter. As we said in our comments 90 days ago when we gave original guidance, we actually anticipate term fees to be down meaningfully on a full year basis. If you recall, we have very strong term fees in the fourth quarter of last year, and that's where we'll see that decline more prevalent.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you very much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Oh, yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, I guess, first of all, just sequentially, there's a couple of things in Q2 I'm wondering about. First is, in the FI segment, how much sequentially should that be down, given \u2013 I think you said it was late in the quarter that the Lending business went away, probably running at, like $50 million a quarter. I think the disclosure was somewhere around that. So, should that be down like $40 million sequentially?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. On a adjusted revenue basis, that's correct. So, that will be out of our revenue on an adjusted and a GAAP basis. Essentially, March 29, I think, was the closing date for it. So, it's in there for the full first quarter, will be out to balance the year. In order of magnitude, your number's about right.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Cool. And then, secondly, I remember last Q2 in the Payments segment you had a $15 million kind of one-off headwind. Does that create a really easy comp for margins, so Payment margins could be up at 100 basis points, 200 basis points or something, that \u2013 just this quarter?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","So, you are correct. You're remembering correctly. We did have a $15 million charge in the second quarter of last year, and we certainly do not see that repeating in 2018. So, that will provide a benefit.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Dave, I would say that the only potential offset is, as we mentioned when we gave guidance last year, that we were going to be spending money, making investments. And there will be some ramping of those investments. But I would certainly agree with Bob that we wouldn't expect to have anything like that recurring in Q2.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Well, thanks, guys. Good job.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Ramsey.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Ramsey.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","You mentioned that Q1 is the low watermark in terms of overall growth. Can you just speak to \u2013 and this question dovetails a little bit with some of the others that you've already answered, but can you just speak to sort of cadence we should expect for the remaining three quarters? Is it a gradual increase quarter-over-quarter? Is there a little bit of steeper acceleration later in the year? And also, Jeff, if you could just cover off on the drivers of deceleration in Financial segment revenues in Q1, which you went through, and I may have missed them?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So, I'll take the first part and I'll let Bob take the second part, and I'll let Bob correct the first part. When we gave guidance for the year, we indicated that we would have \u2013 we expected Q1 to be weak. We had a whole bunch of periodic revenue last year in Q1 and so we knew that was going to make the comparable a little bit more difficult. And then if you look at the growth rates last year in Q1, Q2 and Q3, I think that's a good way to think about how our acceleration will happen somewhat inverse to that because the Q2 was where it was and then Q3 was down lower and then Q4 was quite strong.","So, if you think about our revenue, if you look at our processing revenue, we're quite happy with how we're building our high-quality recurring revenue. We continue to believe that will step up throughout the year and then that \u2013 and that will layer in against the comparables. But then we also have significant implementations going on with Architect, DNA, Biller, Zelle, those kinds of programs on top of everything else that we have going on a regular basis, which we'll be adding in. We would expect to see some recovery in periodic revenue as well over the next couple of quarters as we get back to a more normative level from where we started in the year. Bob?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","And then your question around the Financial segments, we saw the Financial segment for the quarter up 1% internal rate of growth. We saw some good growth in our account and item processing businesses, but we did see that the periodic revenue decline that I talked about overall for the company, about $9 million. The majority of that manifests itself from the Financial segment. So, that helps \u2013 that mitigated some of the benefit for the growth we got from accounts and item processing.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay. And then, one more for me. On balance sheet deployment and capital deployment strategy here, it feels like the valuations in fintech are pretty stretched. Your free cash flow conversion has always been excellent, and with the lower tax rate, it's even better. Is now a better time to contemplate potentially rolling in a dividend? Is that something that could be in your long-term thinking, or are you still sort of saving your dry powder for when you may need it for some other uses of capital?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Ramsey, I would say we're pretty disciplined about our capital allocation strategy, how we think about it in terms of biasing the share repurchase acquisitions and then debt repayment. But we also, kind of on an umbrella basis, look each year on, should we pay a dividend or how should we think about that. And so we do that, and we will do it again this year, of course. I think for now, we feel like our strategy makes the most sense. We are pretty disciplined about how we think about intrinsic value vis \u00e0 vis our allocation to share repurchase and, obviously, with the recent tax law change and how to think about NPV, right. That had a very significant impact on how we would consider intrinsic value. But again, what we're focused on is delivering value to shareholders. And on a year-in and year-out basis, we'll continue to try to determine what's the right formula for optimizing or maximizing that value for them.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks a lot for that.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good evening.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question. It's something you've touched on, but I wanted to ask about what you're seeing in Europe so far this year in terms of the regulatory environment, just in terms of how it's been evolving and whether there's any specific opportunities that you're seeing. You seem to be calling out a strong pipeline, so I'm just curious whether net-net you stand to benefit from Europe's regulatory changes around payments. And specifically, I just want to see if you could talk a little bit about the shift to faster payments and what you're seeing over there, and whether it's a trend you think you can capitalize on?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So, just \u2013 Jeff, it's a great question and it's always interesting to watch what's going on in other parts of the world and trying to extrapolate how that might impact us here. The areas that we're the most focused on in Europe right now would be the idea of open banking and what are the implications. One of the opportunities that we have is that we bought Monitise last year and acquired the FINkit technology, which is a really fabulous tool for purposes of helping financial institutions enable their APIs to be open banking-ready. And so we're making progress there. We're excited about that and the opportunities. I expect us to have some announcements over the next couple of quarters on selling that capability and for open banking purposes.","And the other area in which we're very, very focused is on payment hub technology, as we mentioned. And Dovetail, the business Dovetail as opposed to the product Dovetail, the business Dovetail had a very nice presence outside the U.S., and we're using that to leverage in Europe as well as Asia and LatAm to see how we can further extend the reach of Dovetail. So, we're certainly focused there.","On faster payments in Europe, we don't have specific payment capability, kind of front-facing payment capability, as we do here, but we are very interested in watching what's going on in the agent bank space. Basically, as I'm sure you know, in Europe, and in the UK specifically, you have to have \u2013 basically financial institutions have to use another agent to move money around, and it looks like regulatorily that might open up and I think that will create some interesting opportunities for us as we move forward.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. I appreciate that. And then, I appreciated the update you \u2013 in terms of what you're seeing from Zelle in the quarter. I just want to make I understand your comments. And \u2013 were you saying that \u2013 is Zelle revenue starting to layer in in a meaningful way? And can you talk about whether perhaps there is any change in terms of how you're thinking about Zelle as a revenue source for you over the course of this year?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we're expecting Zelle to contribute to revenue. It's part of why our internal revenue growth is going to go up at least 80 basis points year-over-year. Zelle is a piece of that. Now, there are a number of pieces in there. But Zelle, we like what we're seeing in Zelle both in terms of new signings, but the sequential growth in transactions is significant. And we're a bit constrained right now in our ability to get clients live. That's the network itself is experiencing some growing pains. But we are very, very bullish on Zelle and really in terms of both the P2P opportunity, but the other payments opportunities that will be resident within the network itself. So, we'll be talking about Zelle for a while. I think it'll also be a while before we're calling it out as being as big as we'd like it to be, but we are quite enthusiastic and are seeing measurable results in 2018.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hello? Matt, you there?","Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP","I'm sorry, gentleman. I was on mute. Can you hear me now?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Perfect, perfect.","Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP","Sorry. Apologies. I was hoping you could just give a quick update on the competitive landscape both with respect to kind of traditional and maybe some of the newer players, whether it's a Q2 or a Temenos. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. It is \u2013 the competitive question is always interesting because we have some common competitors in certain spaces and very distinctive competitors in other spaces whether it's a Q2 or Temenos or the more traditional competitors. I would say, on balance, as opposed to talking about specific competitors, I would talk about the landscape on balance, is there is more spend available today than there was a year ago. There is more investigation going on than a year ago. And because digital has really moved from a technology to a mindset, we're seeing much more of a need for integration and modernization in technology platforms. We have been working on a series of strategies, whether it be around a middleware integration layer or just truly modern technologies ala FINkit or DNA or others. So, we are seeing more exploration. We are seeing behaviors be generally consistent with what they have been. And frankly, just given some of the results that we're seeing, we're pretty pleased with the portfolio that we have today, and are comfortable that we are well-positioned competitively.","Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you so much. Just on the lower license sales. I guess, tough comp aside, is the lower license sales also by design? I'm just trying to look ahead to next year and see if this creates an easier compare? Or is it just a good baseline to use for Q1 going forward?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes. Tien-Tsin, I'd say it really is just a matter of timing within the year. One of the reasons why we're focused on calling it periodic revenue, to make sure we distinguish it from our processing revenue which had good underlying growth. But we expect that to come back in future quarters and see some growth on a full year basis.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","And Tien-Tsin, I would say you may remember when we gave guidance, we actually said that instead of using the term periodic revenue, we said termination fee revenue would be meaningfully down in 2018. We don't expect license revenue to be meaningfully down. At the same time, we are seeing more and more and more desire of institutions to acquire solutions that were traditionally licensed, but now sold on a cloud or on a hosted basis. And so that does have an effect, but it's not intentional. It's more what the market is demanding.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's basically what I was getting at, that idea of looking for stuff on a hosted basis or what have you. Got it. Thanks for the clarification. Just on the phase 4 operational effectiveness that you mentioned. You teed it up a little bit. Just guessing here, is this going to leverage more maybe from the digital and AI tools that I think we've seen \u2013 Fiserv have talked about it, other firms talked about it. Is that the idea of what that next phase might look like, actually using some of these digital tools to sort of enhance your existing business offerings?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes. I would say, and Bob will cringe because this will absolutely have to fall into the category of forward-looking statement, but phase 4, we'll start to grab that in a fairly meaningful way; and phase 5, I think you'll see a very significant utilization of those capabilities.","Everything from automation, kind of technology automation ala the building of our technology all the way through VCA , RPA and other utilizations to create efficiency and effectiveness across the entirety of Fiserv. So, yes, I think that's going to be very important. And that will actually dovetail quite nicely with the movement to the cloud for the majority of our technologies.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's fine. So, last one. Sorry to ask many. Just on that, is the outsourcing versus insourcing trend changing in your mind given some of this complexity because we hear mixed things in our survey work?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","What do you mean, Tien-Tsin? Give a little bit more color.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","More firms thinking about doing things in-house, maybe re-platforming but doing it internally; or the opposite, looking for third-party vendors, add a best of breed or full service providers like Fiserv to do it on behalf of?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. That's a great question. It depends on probably three things. It depends on the psyche of the institution. Do they \u2013 what pieces of the customer experience do they feel absolutely compelled to own and control? So that will be number one. Number two, it's \u2013 do the institutions have the economic fortitude to invest in building that because it is not cheap? And then third, I think it is actually absolutely directly related to the size of institution.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah. Thank you for insight, Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure, of course. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Your competitors spoke about a pick up in demand. Are you seeing that as well? And if so, where are you seeing it?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, yes, we \u2013 I think we mentioned in our prepared comments that we expect technology spend increase. We had said when we \u2013 in Q4 that we were seeing a little tick-up in demand, and that did manifest in some better sales in Q1 of 2018. Remember that the demand itself doesn't translate to sales for a certain period and then certainly revenue follows in some implementation period after that. But we are absolutely seeing a focus. And I would say, number one, it's in the digital. Number two, it's around payments. Number three, it's about back office modernization. And number four, it's really about products geared at safety and security, so think cyber perimeter, those kinds of capabilities. And then lastly, if I was going to put a category out there around innovation, I would say there's a lot of discussion around AI and RPA, but it's quite early in that exploration.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And then, so just sticking with that thought process, what puts you over the top on the 4.5% growth target? I know you said that Zelle was sort of a key contributor there. But what other large opportunities could you break out for us given where \u2013 given your comments on demand?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. I would say it's probably fair to remember that most of the increase in demand that we see won't really convert to revenue. You'll have little bits and pieces towards the end of the year. But really \u2013 and I think about that this may be a bit of a tailwind, but the majority of what's going to drive revenue for us in 2018 has already been sold and is in implementation or it's very late in the sales process and will get implemented this year. And that's really around some of the larger implementations in biller, the DNA implementations, Architect implementations, Zelle as we talked about, continuing strong growth of Mobiliti. I think we had around 25% subscriber growth in Mobiliti. We have \u2013 we're seeing good volume in card. We talked about some interesting network innovation earlier on, flow, ease of compare.","And then the last thing that's important is we've done some acquisition over the last several years and those are starting to move from being not part of the organic growth calculation to being part of the organic growth calculation. So, when you throw that all into the basket and stir it up, it's all of those pieces that are contributing to us moving to the, not just the 4.5% in 2018, but also looking \u2013 or obviously not giving guidance, but we would certainly be looking to see a step-up in growth in 2019 as well.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Helpful. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bret Huff of Stephens, Incorporated.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","There's a lot of payments change going on, and you guys have your fingers in a lot of those pies. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of consumer interest and adoption versus what banks are investing behind? And as I try and kind of guess as to where the puck's going to be, it seems confusing. I think things like faster payments versus traditional bill pay or peer-to-peer versus faster payments. How is that evolving from both a consumer and a bank investment point of view?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, that's a great question. Brett, I would say, from the consumer's perspective, they don't think about things like faster payments. They think about the fact that it's their expectation, if Amazon can deliver a package in Milwaukee on a same day basis, money should be able to be delivered in Milwaukee on a same day basis. And so, we're seeing both the modernization or the expediting of the rails to allow what we traditionally thought about as ACH to start to move in a faster payments way; not the network, but the idea.","And so whether we're using card rails or TCH or same day ACH or whatever the different capabilities are, it's about creating that enabling capability within the financial institutions, having them connected, creating a broader network that connects to \u2013 in our world, we like to think about connecting to billers or requesters of money. So, creating that ubiquity which will happen over a long period of time, and then allowing that ubiquity to be tapped by different consumer-facing or business-to-business facing application, so Zelle as the example and P2P.","We're also quite excited about our digital disbursements capability, which enable billers to \u2013 as an example, instead of an insurance company having to kind of check, let's just allow money to move seamlessly at the speed of the consumer or the biller's choice. So, creating different kinds of use cases that have this electronified network, and then I won't even go to things like check.","But all of that is going on. And Brett, the other thing that's really important is, how does the digital experience, how does the wallet \u2013 how do I manage my digitally-oriented initiated movement of money via my \"bank\" experience? So, our \u2013 we get to be in the, I think, the unique place of playing both on the modernization of the backend side as well as on the frontend facing.","Bill payment, for example, we are quite excited about real-time money movement. We are working on how do you take advantage of that in bill pay in a completely different way to change the bill payment experience, to have a team much more like Biller Direct, but instead of having to go to 25 websites, I can go to one place and pay what I want, to whom I want, at the speed I want. So, I think it's going to enable consumers to do things in a very different way, and our goal is to make sure that we're playing across that emerging ecosystem.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And a little bit related, the economic model of Dovetail, is that sort of network economics or is it sort of infrastructure economics or an arms dealer kind of software license? How do you guys see that evolving?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","It is dependent upon the size of the institution that's acquiring it. I would say, it is a combination of hosted economics, license economics, and AS \u2013 kind of the old world ASP or cloud economics, depending on the size, institutions taking advantage of that and what they want to do. I wouldn't be so bold as to call it network economics. But I would call it \u2013 I would be comfortable calling it the same kinds of economics that you would see out of \"the high quality revenue\" that we talk about.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update on what you see relative to the M&A landscape at your bank clients. Certainly, valuations are higher across the industry but your term fees are lower. So, do you think that we're unlikely to see a significant uptick in consolidation despite the increase in (48:49) limits? Or how do you think this plays out?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Well, again, Jim, I would say it depends a bit on the size of the institution. I would say, the majority of activity, obviously, in the numbers happens at the low end of the asset tier because, of course, that's where the majority of the banks sit.","I do expect there to continue to be transactions. I expect them to be \u2013 I expect there to be a lower number of transactions this year over last, which is why we're predicting a meaningful reduction in termination fee revenue. And at least the conversations that we're having, we just \u2013 we had the opportunity to spend time with 4,400 client representatives and associates and partners. And everything we're seeing would say that the level of acquisition activity is precisely inverse to valuations. And so people are mostly feeling like valuations are high, and that with rates going up, it's a good time to build out their organic capability, which is one of the reasons why we're feeling bullish on technology spend and certainly the different exploration we would see that supports that. So, I see that.","We are seeing a SLIGHT tick-up in de novo activity, and so \u2013 that's typically a good sign. And I think you'll see some of the larger institutions look for ways to expand more broadly as, kind of, the war on deposits continues to accelerate.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful context, thanks. And then, maybe a capital structure question. You kind of touched on the dividend question earlier, but can you maybe talk about at leverage ratio of just 2 times, I think it's lower than many, many of your peers. Is that something you feel comfortable with permanently? Or do you think that you would feel comfortable kind of taking up leverage even if it's to fund increase buybacks, even if you can't find attractive M&A candidates?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","So, there's two pieces to the answer to that question. One is, as we mentioned earlier, the drop in our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the first quarter of 2.1 times relative to where we were in December. And in fact, where we typically run is really due to the timing of the receipt of the cash from the divestiture of our Lending business, the joint venture there. We certainly would expect that to go back up. We're very comfortable seeing leverage go up. If there's an opportunity to do a large acquisition, we certainly have the strength of the balance sheet and the strength of our cash flow to be able to run a much higher leverage for some extended period of time and then draw that back down if we needed to. Certainly, to be up more towards 2.5 times would be more typical for us.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's kind of an odd deal, Jim. We got a large check on \u2013 what day?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","The 29th.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","The 29th of March, which really took our leverage down below the 2 times, 3 times or so we had been at the end of last year. But I think we're fairly on the record that we prefer to have our leverage much up towards 2.5 times. And I think the answer is, we'll continue to deploy capital in the way that we have and in a way that maximizes shareholder value.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Very clear. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question in queue is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Ashwin?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Ashwin.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Ashwin, are you on mute or did we lose you?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, can you hear me?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. There you go.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, a lot of discussion on this call about digital, and everyone has a digital mandate. I guess my question is, how does that change your contract going forward? Are the terms different? Is the pricing lower due to more cloud hosted delivery and the shorter contracts? Can you talk about that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I'm only \u2013 I'm pausing for a moment. I'm trying to get an idea. I would say that the contract terms are typically would be consistent with the normal contracting process that we have. And it \u2013 Ashwin, it depends a little bit on the type of client. So, is this a digital-only client? Is it a client who buys something via 30 other services? Is it a professional services engagement? So, I think the right way to answer it is \u2013 depends on the solution itself. But I would say that we believe that solutions that are consumer-facing tend to be the ones that institutions are least likely to convert because in fact they are facing their customer base. And so the contract terms themselves are less important than making sure that we're delivering a high-quality service to our clients so they can best serve their customers.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood, understood. And I should probably have explained the context to which I was asking the question, but you got that right. Can you speak about contactless cards? Is that an opportunity you're focused on, particularly dual use cards as we go forward?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. I mean, we're quite focused and ready for contactless. The market continues to move \u2013 the U.S. market continues to move slowly. We were quite encouraged. And one of the larger brands spent a fair amount of their prepared commentary talking about the move of contactless and how quickly it starts to adoption, starts to burn through the base once it started. It's really a matter of, in the U.S., getting it started. I suspect it's still at least a year or two years away, but it would surprise me if by the end of 2019 we weren't seeing a lot more movement on that front.","I think we're \u2013 the whole way digital intersects with card-based payments, it just screams to have contactless be much more front and center. So, I think we'll see it, but it's really a matter of when does the market make the move.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","And thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. You may begin.","Stephanie Gregor - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions, and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon everyone. We executed the business well in the quarter, delivering solid financial results, strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives. Internal revenue growth was 4%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. Sales performance was strong in the quarter, attaining more than 100% of quota and was 34% ahead of last year's second quarter.","Importantly, that momentum carried over into July, producing one of the best sales months in our history. Given the strength of our results to date, and our expectation of revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.38 to $4.45, an increase of 13% to 15% over last year.","Now, let me provide an update on our three key shareholder priorities for 2016, which as a reminder, our first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.","We continue to focus our efforts on increasing our level of high quality revenue growth. As such, our internal revenue growth of 4% in the quarter was highlighted by 6% growth in our payments segment. We saw continued strength in our transactional businesses and EMV card distribution. Overall, internal revenue growth in the quarter was compressed by 80 basis points from a combination of lower termination fees, EMV deferral and negative currency impact.","Adjusted operating margin was up 10 basis points in the quarter and is up 40 basis points through June 30, in line with our expectations. This was led by strong performance in our payments segment which recorded increases in adjusted operating margin of 110 and 170 basis points in the quarter and first six months of the year respectively.","As I mentioned, we raised our earnings per share guidance on the back of a 17% increase in adjusted EPS for the first half of the year. Free cash flow per share to date has trailed adjusted EPS a bit, up 7% through June, which we expect to normalize relative to earnings growth in the second half of the 2016. We're well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year.","Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. One of our flagship payment technologies is our RXP bill payment solution, with over 25 million active users across more than 4,000 financial institutions, including eight of the top 10 banks. Bill payment remains the killer digital app for banking, and during the quarter, we were pleased to renew our longstanding client relationships with PNC Bank, with $350 billion of assets, and SunTrust Bank, with $190 billion in assets.","We've spoken about the opportunity to differentiate our real-time network now, through our unique biller relationships. During the quarter, we expanded our network by signing one of the nation's largest wireless providers to process payments on our BillMatrix platform. In early July, we also signed one of the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers to a comprehensive suite of payment services to provide its members with more convenient health insurance payment options. Our solution will be leveraged for multichannel payments from the state's public exchange, insurer site, IVR, company agents and a good number of our more than 23,000 walk-in locations across the country.","Payment effectiveness requires scale, and we are pleased to be increasing ours in a unique area of our value proposition. Along those lines, you may have seen we inked an agreement with Early Warning, a bank-owned consortium to enable clients to participate in an emerging P2P network, connecting many of the leading financial institutions in the United States together. This furthers our role as a key enabler and advocate for our clients to participate in the ongoing evolution of payments in the manner in which they choose.","Demand for EMV issuance has remained strong, and card personalization volume is growing. As personalization of cards got closer to the number of cards manufactured, the amount of the incremental revenue deferral in the quarter reduced sequentially, but remained at levels higher than anticipated in our internal plan. That said, we expect EMV card demand to remain healthy for the next several years, and also anticipate that to be followed by a wave of contactless card issuance.","Mobiliti ASP users grew by nearly 40% over the prior year's quarter to 4.8 million users and grew 7% sequentially. We also had strong growth in our Mobiliti business solution, with end users growing more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We're still in the very early stages of the digitization of the bank's most important customers.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. During the quarter, Fiserv was recognized multiple times for our innovation including inclusion in the InformationWeek Elite 100, a list of the most innovative users of business technology. We won Best Use of Technology at the PYMNTS.com Alexa awards by connecting our best-in-market Corillian solution to Amazon Echo for voice-based financial transactions and information at the speed of thought.","Westpac Bank, the second largest bank in Australia with assets of over A$830 billion of Westpac Live was ranked number one in Forrester's 2016 Global Mobile Banking Functionality Benchmark Report in July. Westpac's mobile banking offering is built on our market-leading Corillian solution and is supported by Fiserv.","To further digitize branch banking, we announced Verifast, our state-of-the-art Palm Authentication solution. This solution, which relies on sophisticated biometric technology that goes well beyond fingerprint, enables authentication via palm vein patterns and blood flow in the hand. This fast, easy and secure experience is producing much higher customer satisfaction and improving associate productivity.","We see significant deployment opportunities for the back office, teller line, and service desks in the roughly 28,000 branches spanning our nearly 5,000 account processing clients in the US.","Lastly, eight new DNA clients went live in the quarter including three with assets over $1 billion, which brings us to 12 implementations for the year to date as compared to 11 in the same period last year.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $1.3 billion, and increased 5% to $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year to date. These results included 80 and 50 basis points respectively of combined negative impact due to EMV revenue deferrals, reduction in termination fees and FX headwinds.","Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 6% to $413 million and is up a healthy 7% year to date to $812 million. Adjusted operating margin was 31.9% in both the quarter and year to date periods, increasing 10 basis points and 40-basis points respectively over the prior year periods. These gains are due primarily to strong payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by expected margin pressure from acquisitions and continuing investments in new product innovation.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08 in the quarter and for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up a robust 17% to $2.14. Our strong first half performance has resulted in increasing our adjusted EPS outlook for the year.","At the segment level, our payments business continued to deliver strong results with internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 7% year to date. Adjusted revenue, which includes a full quarter's contribution from our two recent acquisitions, grew 11% in the quarter to $693 million. Performance was led by strong results in card services and output solutions including EMV and solid growth in e-payments.","As Jeff mentioned, while we experienced improved EMV personalization, we still lag manufacturing and as a result deferred an additional $3 million of revenue in the quarter. Payments segment adjusted revenue was up 10% year to date to $1.4 billion.","We further extended existing relationships with our market leading solutions including signing 45 debit clients, nearly 60 mobile clients and more than 80 bill payment clients in the quarter. Debit transaction growth in the quarter remained in the high single digits and P2P transaction growth was again more than 30%.","Importantly as Jeff noted, we expanded our base of Mobiliti ASP subscribers by nearly 40% in the quarter to 4.8 million. We continue to believe we're in the early innings of the digital transformation and see significant runway into the future growth as consumers further integrate digital and specifically mobile banking into the fabric of their day to day lives.","Payments segment adjusted operating margin was excellent, increasing 14% in the quarter to $238 million and year to date was up 16% to $463 million. Segment adjusted operating margin crossed 34% for the first time, expanding 110 basis points to 34.3% and was up 170 basis points to 33.9% for the first half of the year. This strong performance is even better when considering the adjusted operating margin compression from the businesses we acquired early in the year. Our acquisition integration efforts are progressing well and we expect to begin realizing synergy benefits late this year and into 2017.","Adjusted revenue in the financial segment was $613 million in the quarter and $1.2 million (sic) [$1.2 billion] in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth in the financial segment was 1% in both the quarter and year to date. Segment growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a combination of currency, implementation timing, and a reduction of specialized regulatory-based services and lower termination fees.","For the full year, we now expect lower termination fees compared to last year. This is due primarily to an estimated reduction of termination fee revenue in Q3 of $15 million to $20 million compared to the higher than typical level in the third quarter of last year, most of which did not originate in the account processing businesses. And while a reduction in termination fee revenue is generally good for the long-term health of the business, it can create comparability issues as we're seeing this year. That said, we expect to return to more normal termination fee revenue in the fourth quarter.","We continue to expect stronger financial segment growth in the second half of the year, as we see higher license-related revenue, new client implementations, revenue from the rollout of new innovative technology solutions such as Notifi and Palm Authentication and improved termination fee comparison in Q4.","Adjusted operating income in the financial segment was $202 million in the quarter and $397 million year to date. Adjusted operating margin was down 150 basis points in the quarter to 33%, but was up 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted margin in the quarter was impacted by several factors, including lower termination fees and incremental investments in innovation-based solutions such as Agiliti and Notifi.","Corporate adjusted net operating loss for the quarter was in line with expectations and generally consistent with the comparable prior-year results.","Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter, slightly lower than the prior year's comparable rate of 34.6%. And while we continue to anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year, our comparable tax rate for the second half of the year at about 36% is significantly higher than last year's adjusted effective tax rate for the second half of 2015, which was just over 34%.","Free cash flow was $442 million during the first half of the year, with the timing of working capital, including receivables and tax payments, impacting the first half of the year results, which we expect to improve by the end of the year. Free cash flow per share is up 7% to $1.95 for the first six months of the year.","Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of June 30 or 2.4 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. We continue to utilize share repurchase as our capital allocation benchmark, repurchasing 2.8 million shares of stock in the quarter for $283 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased 6.2 million shares at an average cost of $97 per share. And at quarter's end, there were 220.6 million shares outstanding and 11.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned up front, sales in the second quarter were excellent, coming in 34% higher than last year's second quarter and 108% of quota. Performance was strong across the board and included only a minimal number of large transactions. Sales momentum continued to be very strong in July. We signed several large transactions, which underpinned one of our best single month sales performance in our history. Importantly, several of these wins have shorter implementation cycles and should provide measurable impact revenue in the fourth quarter. At this point, we fully expect to exceed our sales goal for the year.","Integrated sales were $66 million in the quarter, flat to the prior year and up 38% sequentially, driven primarily by digital and payments solutions. Delivering value to clients through our add-on solutions continues to be a very important element of our company strategy.","Our operational effectiveness program moved forward in the quarter, including measurable progress on our data center optimization program. To date we've combined seven centers and expect to complete additional locations, including one of our largest in footprint later this year. While we're deriving some benefit from these actions currently, there should be a larger aggregate benefit in future years. That said, we did capture $17 million of saves in the quarter and through June 30, we've achieved nearly 70% of our full year operational effectiveness goal of $40 million.","Q2 had more than its fair share of events influencing the environment. We saw a mini-crash in alternative lending as certain high fliers experienced turbulence in their loan portfolios, and while these losses may temporarily slow the proliferation of new lending technologies, we continue to believe the opportunity to introduce new, innovative technology is significant.","Our offerings are well-positioned to benefit directly and indirectly from the continuing rise of the digital financial consumer, which remains a top priority for technology spend across the banking landscape. We also witnessed the volatility of Brexit during the quarter and the related strengthening of the dollar around the world. Although early, we do not anticipate measurable Brexit impact on our non-US business, other than increased currency translation pressure on revenue, which is incorporated in our full year outlook.","We remain on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect 2016 internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, driven by stronger performance in the second half of the year. Given the lower than anticipated termination fees, which as Bob mentioned is exacerbated in the third quarter, the increased pressure of FX and the effect of a larger EMV revenue deferral, we now expect internal revenue growth to bias towards 5% for the full year. We expect a much higher internal revenue growth rate in Q4 compared to Q3, given termination fee comparisons, sales and implementation revenue and additional contributions from our strategic growth initiatives.","As a result of our strong first half performance along with the anticipated growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we've increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.38 to $4.45, which is growth of 13% to 15% over the $3.87 in 2015.","We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least 50 basis points for the year, which includes more than 30 basis points of negative impact from acquisitions and the impact of reduced termination fee revenue. And last, we continue to expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year.","We exit the first half of the year well positioned to meet our current financially goals and have sales momentum to continue moving us forward. As important, we continue to make progress on our journey to sustainably increase our level of high quality internal revenue growth. Before we go to Q&A, allow me to recognize the more than 22,000 associates who make a difference for our clients through innovation and excellence each and every day.","With that, Kerry, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good afternoon. Based on some of your comments about organic growth biasing toward 5% for 2016 as a whole, how should we start to think about next year in a particular \u2013 I'm thinking back to your Analyst Day from last year where you mapped out a 50 to 100 basis point target increase in organic growth over the long term.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, David. So, first of all, we feel actually quite good about the trajectory of our growth rate. We believe that we will grow or expand our internal revenue growth rate in 2016 over 2015 within the 50 to 100 basis point range. But the encouraging news for us is that we do expect to have a much higher growth in the second half of the year and we expect that to be the jumping off point going into 2017. So we feel like we're on track. Our strategic initiatives are coming online. We had a little bit more lumpiness in our revenue this year than we're used to, but again that doesn't affect our longer term view and we would expect to see our internal revenue growth rate continue to increase 50 to 100 basis points a year into the foreseeable future.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Do you have a pretty good line of sight as to how the EMV card personalization revenue deferral is going to roll into Q3 and Q4?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then you called out some nice growth in DNA implementations year to date. Can you talk about the general competitive environment in the large credit union space? You called out in the first quarter call a go live on the Vibrant Credit Union. I mean, how do you see share trends going forward?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So we continue to have a very, very strong success with DNA on the larger end of the credit union space as well as on the larger end of the bank space. On the credit union side, we have continued to win substantially more than our fair share of competitive takeaways when we go up against anyone in the market. So our win\/loss record is quite high going up against a prospect. So we do very well in that environment.","And frankly, the Vibrant go live is was very important to us. As you know well, David, because you've known us for a long time, these tend to be longer tail sales processes and then longer tail implementations. With Vibrant going live just in Q1, that created a level of energy in the market and we have confidence that that will turn into additional conversations. And frankly, we would have an expectation that would turn into additional wins on the larger credit union end of the market.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. And then Jeff, your comments regarding the EMV growth runway, I think you're probably the most bullish in terms of the length of the runway in which you can grow EMV related revenue. Is there anything specific about your customer base on the card issuer side that let's say would give you a longer-term runway for growth? We're starting to see some managements caution that EMV benefit may be near an end, particularly Vantiv on their FI business.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Togut, this is Mark. Or David this is Mark. The key thing that I'd say that's different is because we are so much focused on debit and debit has been later than a lot of the credit processors, we think that there's more runway left for us because of that bias. I'd say that's the biggest thing.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, and I would also add to that David that we remember that we produce cards for a much larger group than just our issuer, kind of our debit issuer banks and so, and much of that business to Mark's point is on the debit side. So not only do we have a fair runway in our own base, but as well as all the other issuers that don't yet use our debit processing services.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you very much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Ramsey.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Given the fairly steep back half acceleration, can you help us think through kind of risk factors that might cause you to come in lower than where you think you're going to come in? Are you depending on implementations that can't get pushed back or how should we sort of assess the risk of what's to come here?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. So, a great question Ramsey. So, we obviously are committed to producing internal revenue growth within our outlook, right, we said biasing to 5% for the year. And the payments segment has performed quite well all year long and we do expect a bit of continuing compound growth coming there as well as new live clients as we've been talking about for the last several years.","So that points the majority of the focus on the financial segment. And our calculus, and we've looked at this sort of a variety of different ways, primarily because we are expecting more growth later in the year that we have historically seen and it really comes down to a couple of factors and let me lay them out.","The first one is we've had some kind of lumpiness in the prior year on our compares. So we had some regulatory, and we talked about in the first quarter, some license related revenue that was lumpy in our 2015 numbers and we've had to overcome the substantial majority of that in the first half of the year. And so we see that easing on both fronts, and therefore we're already covering that in terms of our recurring revenue and we would expect is that lumpiness in the prior year went away that we'll get some comparable benefit.","The second item, and this is one of the larger ones, is just this, the continuing growth in our transactional services. Now some of these are certainly on the payments side, lending, I'm sorry, Mobiliti, EMV as we were talking about the reduction of the deferral. But we've also seen some very good growth in our lending businesses. Our largest account processing client went live late in Q2. So all of those we believe will provide benefit.","The next item is you'll remember back to last year, we had a pretty slow sales year really until Q4 and it was actually primarily in December, actually December of 2015 was by far our largest sales month in history. And as you know, most of our implementations run six, nine, 12 months or more, so the revenue that we signed last December, it's starting to come live in this second half of the year and a lot of that was in the financial segment. So, we're excited about that.","And then lastly, on the sales front, we mentioned on our prepared remarks a couple of the large wins that we had this year have either unusually short implementation cycles or they are made to be unusually short because we were working them well before we signed them. So in fact, we would expect a number of those larger deals to contribute revenue in Q4. All of those items we have pretty darn good visibility to. And then lastly, just the compound effect again of some of our innovation-based initiatives, programs like our integrated payment strategy, Notifi, Agiliti and the like.","So we've got a long laundry list, knowing that this would be an important point. We've got it. We've got them recorded and we've got our management and our teams focused to make sure that we achieve the numbers in the second half of the year. But again, I think very importantly is these growth engines are not one and done engines. These are engines that will sustain. It will give us we think very good, a very good tailwind entering into 2016. And then when you combine that with the very good sale \u2013 into 2017, I'm sorry \u2013 when you combine that with the very good sales performance that we're seeing this year and we expect to see this year, we're pretty bullish on how 2017 is starting to stack up.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Great. That's super helpful. Another question I wanted to ask was about free cash flow. You'd mentioned there were a couple of puts and takes in terms of why it is, on absolute basis, I think relatively flat versus last year and not growing too fast on a per share basis. Can you revisit that? For some reason, I was expecting the EMV revenue deferral to have a similar positive impact on cash flow, but I might not be getting that correct. Could you go through again just sort of the cash flow dynamics and why you expect them, what's been weighing on them and why they're going to pick up a little later in the year?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, Ramsey. It's Bob. There were the two key drivers that I talked about from a working capital standpoint in terms of accounts receivable as well as the timing of our tax payments, with actually the bigger weighting on accounts receivable. And yes, you're right. The way to think about EMV, some of that deferral is cash positive because we see the cash in advance of booking the revenue. But that has declined pretty precipitously over last four quarters, down to only about $3 million this quarter. So not a big driver from a cash flow standpoint. And that receivables collection is really a timing and in fact we started to see that collection turn already in July. So those receivables have started to turn into cash already for third quarter.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. That's all for me.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Ramsey.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Just wanted to I guess clarify just I guess the bias to the 5%. It sounds like term fees is the biggest contributor to that. And then I may have missed it. If that's the case, then how are you able to I guess upgrade your EPS target, given that's a higher margin component? Is it just mix or you are pulling some levers to get there?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Tien-Tsin you did hear that on the termination fees and it is by far the largest single impacting item, I would say are the unplanned item in our results, or our estimated results for 2016. Obviously, it's kind of a mixed bag, right, on one hand, it's always better to not have termination fee revenue. On the other hand, termination fee revenue tends to have fairly high margins as you note.","You probably heard in our prepared remarks that we're doing quite a nice job on our operational effectiveness program. We're already at about 70% of our earlier target and the beauty of that is that's real economic benefit that the margins on that are comparable to margins on term fees.","So there is some benefit there. And frankly, as you know well, if you look at the sources of our growth being in the payments segment, the payments segment, I think we mentioned in our remarks crossed over 34% for the first time ever, I mean, the mix of the revenue is actually working quite favorably for us this year and we're not pulling any levers beyond the normal levers that we always pull. It just so happens that in some of the products, take Mobiliti that we invested in several years ago, once you cross the line on that, the contributions are pretty attractive.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. So, high incremental margins there. Makes sense. And just as a follow up, just Jeff, you commented, it sounds like June, July are pretty strong from a sales perspective despite what you called out , right, Brexit and the alt lending. So why do you think that's the case? What pulled through some of this strong selling? Because we've heard sort of mixed things around discretionary spend. It sounds like you're seeing good sales execution. Why is there a delta in your mind?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","It's really across two planes, as best I can see. One is a majority of our larger sales are tending to be non-discretionary. So it's using our BillMatrix platform to process payments for one of the very large Blues where there is very interesting dynamics going on in the health insurance and therefore the health payments industry that we're just starting to play in. We've been farming that space for a couple of years. We mentioned we signed one of the largest wireless companies in the US, again to use one of our payment acceptance platforms. And that, we've talked about a lot, is an important differentiator in our NOW strategy. So the ability to route payments, not just through issuers, but being able to have issuers, consumers and billers using the same real-time ecosystem. You may have seen that we signed an arrangement with EWS. So again, building out that payment movement or the movement of money capability. So on the non-issuer side, that's working out quite well.","On the issuer side, we're continuing to see lots and lots of energy around capabilities that are improving the digital experience. So, mobile, online. Online is getting an interesting wave of at least refresh lookie-loos saying, hey I've got this really great mobile experience, what do I do with online? And then some of our payments capabilities that are, whether it's our IPS set of capabilities, account transfer, bill payment, which is still kind of as I mentioned the killer app of non point-of-sale payments, those are all the areas which we're getting focus and having good interest and frankly that's why our sales are good. But importantly, our pipeline continues to grow pretty precipitously.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, good. Thanks for the insight, Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hey, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And I guess, first of all you mentioned about 80 basis point headwind from some of the one-offs this quarter, lower term fees, FX, EMV, the deferral there. Can you give us what that impact is on each of the segments?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","We typically wouldn't do that, but EMV sits in payments and the others are generally I think in financial. So, I'm not exactly giving it to you Dave, but that's the roundabout.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Okay. Okay. And then I guess secondly for Q3, you mentioned the $15 million to $20 million term fee headwind. Does that mean that Q3, the core \u2013 it sounds like the core, the full half \u2013 the second of the year is going to accelerate, but does Q3 get kind of pushed back down towards kind of the same growth as Q1 and Q2 given that roughly a little over 1% headwind to the business? And then Q4 is where the real acceleration happens, right?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's a good way to think about it because of obviously the termination fees. Those termination fees, while they're not from the account processing businesses, they are sitting in that segment. So, I think that's a reasonable way to think about it.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then I guess, just the last thing, the $26 million of acquisition benefit this quarter, is there any real seasonality there or is that a pretty good number, kind of the rest of the year to think about, that $26 million per quarter?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, we think that overall the acquisition benefit for the year is about 75% to 85%, so about 25% a quarter. Of course we acquired both those businesses kind of mid to latter part of first quarter. So minimal impact Q1; full benefit in Q2.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on where the pipeline of DNA wins stands today? You talked about eight new conversions coming on with three over $1 billion. Can we maybe talk a little bit about \u2013 and I think that the total pipeline stands at a little over 20 as of last quarter. So have you refilled that pipeline and do you expect the remaining ones over $1 billion to come on before the year end?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Well, we're optimistic, Jim, that we're always going to have a nice backlog of DNA wins, but we don't have any reason to believe that our expectation for go-lives in the year has changed. I mean, we're moving that along, and again, as I mentioned to Dave's question earlier, interest in DNA continues to be very strong across all charter types. So from a pipeline perspective, we would expect that to continue to be additive.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then with respect to the operational effectiveness program, you talked about the 70% attainment toward the $40 million target for the year. Is that something you would expect, that you would kind of potentially pull future program savings into this year or would you plan to kind of get to that $40 million attainment and then just kind of stop and reset for 2017? And can you maybe talk about how much more there is to go on the data center side specifically?","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","We don't really manage it around the financials. We manage it to drive as much operational effectiveness as we can. The target that we have has specific programs attached to it and those are all tracking well or better than we might have expected going into the year. But we don't moderate the pace of those around kind of how much is realized in any one given year. So no, we wouldn't slow that down.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I would say, Jim, I mean to Mark's point, in most years we exceed our target by a bit and that, I would obviously, given where we are this year, we would expect that. On the data center piece itself, there is a lot of runway, right, as we talked about at our investor day last year. It's taken us awhile to get some muscle and a cadence around it. We've gotten seven so far completed year to date. And we would expect that to continued grow for the next several years. Ultimately we're going to go down to a handful of larger data centers that we think will help deliver a better service to our clients and frankly reduce our costs. So that's a meaningful opportunity moving forward.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","And Jim, I'd just remind you, we're in year one of a five year program that's got a $250 million five year objective for saving. So we're in the very early stages of five years of cost improvement.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Condra of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Afternoon, all.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just a couple, first on the Early Warning, can you just talk a little more about what, I guess what Fiserv gets out of that arrangement and anything about economics that work for you?","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. So, this is Mark. I mean the arrangement, we're pretty excited about it. The Early Warning, as you probably know is kind of really has picked up the clearXchange business and they have been working on this development of kind of a large bank P2P network that their owners can all sign on to. What we announced today is that we will be a technology provider to offer our technology, our P2P technology, which includes lots of different kind of back-end services that would enable any financial institution in the country to participate in that network that EWS is going to be introducing.","So in many ways, I think we're really in the leading position to provide this turnkey technology that financial institutions in general will need. Now, some of the larger banks that are, remember that are owner-members of the EWS have built their own technology, but an awful lot of other financial institutions. And certainly, as you go into the larger number of community institutions still rely on a technology provider like us to give them the back-end systems they need to participate in that kind of a network.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I would also say, Paul, I mean part of this is, we're in the early stages of understanding what it's all going to mean. Like many other service offerings, some banks will create, some institutions will create their own P2P offering and some will use parts of ours or parts of someone else's, but many of them we believe will use all of ours. We've got roughly 2,400 institutions today in the US that are using our Popmoney technology, and as Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're up to a pretty solid cadence of a 30% transactional growth every quarter. We're announcing year over year growth kind of in that range.","It is our belief that there are roughly 100 person-to-person payments per household per year. So, 100 times 110 million households roughly in the US that have an opportunity to be digitized, electronified and moved in a different way. And whether that ends up being 5% or 10% or 50%, none of us really know, but we believe that our technology is central to having that happen. So ultimately, we think we'll drive transaction volume.","We'll think there will be network gateways. There'll be risk products. There will be all kinds of different pieces of that value chain, and we've been in this for a while. We've got a nice footprint. Some clients will probably link to Early Warning, but what we do know is, with the 5,000 institutions that we provide core account processing for today, we think we'll play an important role in serving them. And the 4,000 institutions that use our bill payment solution, including eight of the top 10 banks in the US will continue to operate with us. We think there is ultimately going to be quite an exciting and interesting payment ecosystem beyond point-of-sale that's created.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, I mean it sounds like there is a lot going on. Kind of leads into my next question, which is as you're getting into these emerging areas, lending, mobile, I think you talked about biometrics and P2P, and how does that feed into the way you think about M&A? Do you have all the capabilities you need or are there some assets out there that might make sense?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I think any of us would be foolish to say we have all of the assets that we need. We feel quite good that we've got the lion's share of what's necessary today. But we will continue to be active reviewers of what's going on in the market and look for opportunities to improve our product set or our solution set to help drive value for our financial institution and non-financial institution clients. So we're active out there, but we'll continue to be pragmatic and compare every allocation of capital to share repurchase as we always do and again look for opportunities to get the tailwinds of the macros whenever we can.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just starting off quickly, just if you help us understand what the normalized growth rate do you think would have been in the financial segment if you can sort of address or adjust for all those items that affected this quarter? Just so we can help understand the normalized growth going forward.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I'm only pausing, Darrin, because I'm trying to think about, we typically don't give much segment-by-segment guidance. But I would say that it would be measurable and probably we'll leave it at that.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks. Let me just follow then on a question that was asked before with your thoughts on what you have in terms of assets. I'm really just trying to understand, A, the competitive environment now. I mean obviously one of your biggest competitors has made a very large acquisition focusing on larger financial institutions. Has that led to a change at all in your area of focus around the core or area of focus around some of the larger banks, on some of the ancillary services you may provide some of the larger financials. And then maybe a follow-on would be, just on the M&A side again, I mean you've talked a lot about international over the years being an opportunity, and yet I think we're still waiting to see if something actually happens on the M&A front there. So can you just update us on your thoughts around anything outside of the domestic market? Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure, Darrin. So, I assume that on the competitive question, you were talking about the guys who bought SunGard. We don't really compete very much against the SunGard assets and that is not strategically aligned with where we're focused in the market. So frankly, we have not seen very much change in the competitive market because of that. And I don't see a lot of parallel between for example what's going on in the P2P space with the Early Warning announcement and our over 2,000 institutions using Popmoney and what is being done in that larger end. And so, strategically that's not where we've elected or opted to focus. So we'll continue to look for ways to increase the robustness and the relevance of our model. But I don't think you'll see us to do something like that.","As it relates to the non-US side of the market, the beauty of the US market is it's a relatively singular large market and there are not any other large singularly focused markets in the world with the exception of probably China and perhaps India and those markets have nuances of their own that we won't talk about at this point. So, the challenge for us is being, we'd like in some ways have a larger non-US footprint, but we want that non-US footprint to have the high quality revenue characteristics that we look for, and those would be sustainable recurring streams of revenue that have attractive levels of free cash. So we continue to use those screens and that's always going to be the constraints to how we think about deploying capital both in and out of the US.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense guys. Thanks very much for the help.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking the call. Nice win with Early Warning.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And Jeff, it sort of I guess dovetails into my bigger picture with regard to Mobiliti and the payments segments obviously performed very nicely. Can you quantify perhaps in your segment organic revenue growth the contribution from Mobiliti solutions in aggregate? And then maybe, I know it's hard to quantify, but maybe and its early, perhaps frame up timing for contribution from the clearXchange solution. I mean is that a function of banks throwing it out? Is it a function of transaction volume on the platform? How should we think about that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So let me, I'll give it a shot and Mark will fill in where I have missed. So I'm going to take the second one first. So, we have ideas on how the rollout will go. I think there has been some discussion publicly about advertising and some marketing around the P2P services for some of the larger institutions. We've seen that going on intermittently, but there seems to be a lot of energy around that. And our experience at least with services such as bill pay is when you talk about them to consumers, they tend to want to start using them.","So, we would expect to see transactions start to grow as where awareness is raised and perhaps it won't be as \u2013 the velocity won't be the same as Venmo, but frankly, we believe that most consumers would prefer to transact in an area that is safe and secure and through their trusted financial institution. And so we're optimistic about how that will turn into growth in the future. We would expect that growth to primarily be to come through as payment transaction volume, some services, helping institutions think about how they're going to best position their offerings or embed some of our technologies in their own unique offerings if they would like to do.","There are many, Andrew, institutions who use our bill pay technology, but they embed into an experience that's unique to them. And I think we'll see some of that as we move through P2P. So I think it will come through in a lot of different ways, ultimately be through transactions and either transactions that we initiate or transactions that we accept on behalf of our clients. So, a little bit more of a gateway nuance on top of the normal end to end processing that we do overall.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","The only thing I'd add, as Jeff said, the volume of transactions is where we think this is ultimately going to, why this might be different this time. And fundamentally, we've known for some time that in order to get sort of a ubiquitous P2P offering really to take off in the United States, you needed a couple things that most of these networks were not able to fully deliver. You needed it coming from a trusted financial institution. That's why we have been around this business, and kind of pushing this business so hard. We think that's a big opportunity. It needs to be a branded solution that people will recognize. And that's been a challenge to break through with a brand in the market.","But very importantly, there is two other factors that I think is going to come through with this. One is the ubiquity of it, being available through the largest financial institutions and being able to find end points through much of the banking system is really where the promise of what we think the EWS offering plays. The other aspect of this is that network will be at its inception a real-time network. And we think that the consumer value proposition that comes along with a real-time network and a real-time transaction is the kind of thing that will generate more enthusiasm for use over some of the other competitive alternatives. So for all those reasons, we're again optimistic. We've been optimistic about P2P as a potential game changer for some time, and we think this continues to be a nicely evolving line of business.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","And Andrew, let me just move on to the other half of your question. We don't disclose what the size of the mobile or digital business is on a standalone basis. We have, at our investor days, we have kind of put wheels out there that give the general sizing as typically part of our, I think it's part of our e-payments business. But it's out there. It's a rapidly growing piece of the business. The growth contributions are important. And I would actually venture to say we are even earlier in our mobile journey and our online transformation journey than we are in our EMV journey. And that is, I mean we have significant growth runway to go. Most of the pundits believe that we'll see over the next three to five years 70% to 80% of banking users be mobile, and that number for us is well, well, well, well south of that. So, we feel quite good about that and again, I would not underestimate the importance of remodeling the digital experience for online as well. So, both of those we think are important.","And then we did do the little \u2013 the ACI, the Community Financial Services acquisition early on, we're just starting to move those client institutions and ultimately their customers into the mix, and we think there is a lot of value to be created there as well.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's great perspective. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Ashwin.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Jeff, actually your last question is a good segue into what I wanted to ask or clarify. As Mobiliti becomes more or less mainstream, and clearly you have many relevant front end products for that, should that not lower your cost structure over time because these channels are also inherently more self service, more cloud based? Is that already part of your operational effect and your thought process? How should we think about the cost side implications of it?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. The answer is, for the client institutions over time, when digital is scale, self service is a much more important piece of the equation. And so I do believe that for the financial institutions, they'll see cost benefits. For us, the most important part of us getting cost benefits is scaling the platform. So the more scale we get in the platform, the lower our costs, kind of a unit cost, will get over time.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So you won't see lower support costs or anything like that? You are primarily benefiting from growth?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, I mean again, if you think about, we supply these technologies to the financial institution. They're supplying them to their end customers. We take in, if we have a core account processing client, we're providing them with support for any one of the 28 different applications that they have. I think as humans get more dependent on self service, it could have a derivative impact on us. But we haven't thought about that as a way of reducing our costs, but I'll certainly have Bob take a look at that.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And Bob, sorry to create work for you there. The other question I had was on pipeline, and I think you may have answered part of it, but just want to revisit. It seems like it took maybe six or seven months to go from one sales peak last December to this July, if I can call this July sort of a sales peak. Does that mean that you now have to again replenish for the next one, two quarters in terms of what your sales is going to look like in the second half of the year?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, I think that at least from our standpoint, one of the reasons why we're so bullish both for our results this year, but also moving into 2017, is our pipeline. Even with the very strong performance, the pipeline is quite robust right now. And it's not as geometric as we had a peak in December and a peak in July, because frankly, we did have a slower year last year. We had a very, very strong year in 2014. We spent a good part of 2015 replenishing the pipeline, but not just replenishing it by adding in clients, but really looking at our processes and building what we believe is a more sustainable engine for the future in ensuring that that pipeline maintains at a higher level.","I would actually say that we have more large transactions in our pipeline right now than \u2013 even with our closes in July than we had at the same juncture last year. So, the values, the values and especially the kind of probability weighted values are substantially better now than they were a year ago. And given some of the momentum that we're seeing, we would at least be optimistic that we would be in even better shape a year from now.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you, appreciate the color.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Bryan.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just a couple clarifications. In 3Q 2016, if there's not going to really be an acceleration internal revenue growth, I think that would suggest a bigger number in fourth quarter, maybe an 8% internal revenue growth in fourth quarter to make it average out 2.5% for the year. Just want to make sure that's true, because you're also talking about that being the jumping off point for 2017. So, 8% would be a quite higher growth rate than what we've seen in the past when we think about 2017, so...","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, no, that's right. I mean, I can't speak to the exactness of the numbers. But I would say that they're directionally correct and one of the biggest swing factors tough is the termination swing. So we're getting, Bob, we mentioned in our remarks that we expected termination fee revenue to be down, call it, $15 million, $20 million in Q3. But we expect to return to normal termination fee levels in Q4. So you have that kind of oddity that you have to I think normalize. But beyond that normalization, we always have a little seasonality in Q4, but I think directionally, that's why we have a good amount of confidence when we start thinking about how that translates to 2017.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on free cash flow, I know it was flat kind of year to date. What does that look like then for by we get to the full year? Will free cash flow grow with adjusted earnings per share, which I think is expected to grow 13% to 15%? Will that catch up to grow with that kind of growth rate?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","That's essentially the right way to think about it, Bryan. We'll see better growth in the second half of the year that will more closely approximate the growth in earnings per share. And as we pointed out in the opening comments, we expect to be at more than $4.70 free cash flow to shares.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, Bryan, I think you know pretty well that typically we're running a little bit better than operating earnings in our free cash flow and then we have the benefit of reduced share count. And Bob will probably reprimand me, but basically in Q2, we had a receivable. We had a billed and receivable without any corresponding build in days and we also had a kind of an unusually large tax payment and those kinds of things, we would not expect to recur for the remainder of the year. So, we would expect to be kind of generally back on track.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Correct.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, super. Thanks for the color.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you. Thanks everyone for taking time with us this afternoon. It's always a pleasure. If you have any follow-up, please be sure to contact our Investor Relations group. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Tiffany Willis - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon. I'm pleased to be here today in my new role leading Investor Relations. I look forward to connecting with many of you in the future. With me today for the call are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives, the acquisition of the debit processing and related solutions of Elan Financial Services, and the impact from tax reform. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons.","As a reminder, this year and per-share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials, and comments are adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split completed in March of this year, along with adjusting the comparable 2017 adjusted earnings per share amounts in each period for the sale of the majority interest of our Lending Solutions business, which closed in March.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Tiffany, nicely done on your first earnings call. Good afternoon to everyone joining us today.","We delivered strong financial results, including 5% internal revenue growth in both the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. Additionally, internal revenue growth has been 5% over the rolling 12 months ending in this year's third quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 23% in the quarter and is up a very strong 26% year to date. We remain well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year while continuing to invest in your company.","Free cash flow for the quarter was up 22% to $322 million and is over $800 million year to date, both of which include the divestiture impact of our Lending business. We continue to focus on share repurchase as our primary capital benchmark, allocating $438 million in the quarter and for the year to date have repurchased $1.2 billion.","Before we dive into the results, let me provide perspective on the approximately $690 million acquisition of the debit-based assets of Elan Financial Services, which closed today. This acquisition, with annual revenue of over $170 million, extends our leadership in payments, broadens client reach and scale, and provides new solutions to enhance the value proposition for our existing 3,000 debit solutions clients. We're excited about the opportunity to extend our payments franchise and welcome more than 300 talented associates to Fiserv.","Scale is becoming increasingly important in the payments network and processing businesses. We have spent the last several years quietly migrating more than 1,200 clients to a single debit platform with our most advanced capabilities. We plan to leverage those experiences to successfully migrate the more than 1,000 acquired Elan clients to our platform over the next couple of years.","We see revenue synergy opportunities across three primary areas. First, we have a number of solutions in our existing card portfolio to make available to the existing clients in areas such as the Accel Network, enhanced risk, card production, and digital capabilities such as Card Valet. The acquisition also provides a couple of new solutions which are additive to our portfolio and should contribute to internal revenue growth.","As part of the transaction, we acquired Money Pass, the second largest surcharge-free ATM network in the U.S., with over 33,000 in-network ATMs. In addition, we acquired a small but strong ATM managed services capability, which extends our existing ATM offerings and payments differentiation.","The third opportunity is to provide other Fiserv solutions outside of Card Payments, as the substantial majority of the acquired clients are not currently Fiserv account processing clients. Over time, we expect to compete for new revenue opportunities by demonstrating our solutions strength and integration advantage.","Overall, we believe this synergy opportunity from consolidating to a scaled market-leading platform will add value to the acquired clients and deliver meaningful cost benefits over the next 24 months. We also believe the revenue synergies to be equally significant, but will have a longer ramp given existing client contracts and sales lead times. We generally expect to be at the revenue synergy run rate over a four-year to five-year period. Given synergy timing, we expect this transaction to be modestly accretive to earnings in 2019 and to grow over time.","With that, let's move to our three key shareholder priorities for 2018, which are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.","As I mentioned, we achieved 5% internal revenue growth in the quarter and year to date, driven by strong results from a number of our businesses, including Card, Biller, and Bank Solutions. Internal revenue growth is up 170 basis points versus the comparable nine-month period and is 5% for the trailing 12 months.","As you know, we are making and we will continue to make investments to ensure your business delivers sustained competitive advantage and excellence for our clients, balanced against delivering results that are consistent with expectations.","To that end, adjusted earnings per share was up 23% for the quarter and 26% year to date, from a combination of operating leverage, tax rate reductions, and capital deployment. These very strong adjusted EPS results were delivered in spite of a 100 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin in the quarter and down 20 basis points year to date. The year-over-year decline was due primarily to the Lending divestiture, margin-dilutive acquisitions, and the investment pool established from tax savings earlier in the year. But for these items, adjusted operating margin in the quarter and year to date would have been up 60 basis points and 130 basis points respectively compared to the prior year. We continue to believe we will achieve our revenue and earnings commitments for the year, consistent with our first shareholder priority.","Our second focus is to enhance client relationships, with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. DNA's position as the leading charter-agnostic real-time account processing platform continued with eight signings in the quarter. We announced the addition of CFCU Community Credit Union, with over $1 billion of assets, to our new Digital Edge solutions suite, which is anchored by DNA. In a competitive process, CFCU selected our comprehensive digital-centric platform to provide their members access to our leading digital and payment solutions, integrated into DNA. Market interest in Digital Edge is growing, and we believe it will be a longer-term differentiator for the digital-first market.","We had eight DNA clients go live in the quarter and a total of more than 20 since January. We expect nearly 30 DNA clients to go live in the year, which would be a record number of annual implementations.","We continue to see important growth both for us and our clients across our digital banking solutions. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew by 23% in the quarter to just under 8 million. Due to strong demand, we have expanded our Architect implementation teams and expect to bring 12 clients live in Q4 alone, which will double the number of go-lives for the full year. We anticipate exiting the year with strong Architect sales, a large implementation backlog, and continuing market momentum.","We're seeing interest in sales activity in platform modernization with our recently acquired Dovetail payments platform. We were pleased to sign Union Bank, with $160 billion of assets, to enable their connectivity to the TCH real-time payments network. We also signed BBVA Compass, with nearly $90 billion of assets, to help modernize their enterprise payment capabilities and the shift towards real-time settlement. We were recognized in the quarter by IDC for a Real Results Award for next-generation payments for enabling instant payments in our Dovetail solution for Intesa Sanpaolo, the leading bank in Italy with a strong international footprint.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Zelle continues to garner significant market focus and attention, leading us to sign more than 50 new Zelle clients in the quarter. We were also pleased to bring Dollar Bank, with $8.5 billion in assets, live in the quarter. We expect the continuing ramp of new Zelle clients in Q4 and meaningful acceleration in 2019. We remain focused on ways to accelerate implementation cycles to meet the growing market demand. Zelle transactions were up more than 50% sequentially, and through September 30 are more than 10 times the prior-year level. Our conviction in Zelle remains high, as financial institutions accelerate their focus at the intersection of digital capabilities and real-time money movement.","Lastly, we are seeing additional interest in our Immediate Funds solution, which provides financial institutions the opportunity to provide their customers with instant access to deposited funds. A top 10 bank selected our solution in the quarter to address this evolving opportunity and plans to offer this service to their customers across multiple channels.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob for more detail on our financial results.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon.","Adjusted revenue was up 1% to $1.3 billion in the quarter and 2% to $4.1 billion year to date. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the quarter, driven by strong performance across a number of our businesses, and is also up 5% for the nine-month period. For comparison, our reported internal revenue growth through September would have been 50 basis points higher had we restated our results under ASC 606.","Adjusted operating income in the quarter was down 2% to $425 million and for the year to date was up 2% to $1.3 billion, both of which were impacted by the Lending transaction. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 31.6%, a decrease of 100 basis points, and was down 20 basis points through September 30. The performance in the quarter includes a 160 basis point headwind from a combination of the Lending divestiture, acquisitions which closed last year, and the impact of the client-focused incremental investments funded through tax savings. This headwind was partially offset by 60 basis points from our strong operational effectiveness performance and operating model leverage.","We now expect 2018 adjusted operating margin to expand about 10 basis points, at the low end of the range, given the slower ramp of acquisitions, including Elan which closed today, and high opportunistic in-year investments.","Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $0.75 in the quarter and increased 26% to $2.26 through the first nine months of the year. Based on our strong performance to date, we expect to achieve double-digit adjusted EPS growth for our 33rd consecutive year.","Payments segment adjusted revenue was up 6% to $779 million in the quarter and up 7% to $2.3 billion year to date. Strong performance in our Card Services and Biller businesses drove internal revenue growth of 5% for both the quarter and first nine months of the year.","Increased adoption and growing transaction volumes remain important elements of driving high-quality revenue growth. In the quarter, debit transactions were up double digits. And total P2P transactions, including both Popmoney and Zelle, grew nearly 50%. Additionally, Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 23% to nearly 8 million, continuing to reinforce the importance of digital in the evolving landscape of financial experiences.","Adjusted operating income in the Payments segment grew 5% to $267 million in the quarter and 7% to $809 million year to date. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter contracted 40 basis points to 34.2% and has expanded 20 basis points to 34.9% for the year to date. Segment adjusted operating margin results were negatively impacted by 140 basis points in the quarter from a combination of the headwind from acquisitions and the investments from tax savings, which were included in our guidance shared at the beginning of the year.","For the Financial segment, adjusted revenue decreased 7% to $574 million for the quarter and 4% to $1.8 billion for the first nine months of the year due to the Lending transaction. Internal revenue growth, which considers the divestiture, was up a strong 4% in both the quarter and year to date, driven primarily by solid performance from our account and item processing businesses.","The Financial segment's adjusted operating income decreased 8% in the third quarter to $187 million and declined 4% to $590 million for the year to date, again, due to the Lending transaction. Adjusted operating margin contracted 40 basis points to 32.7% for the quarter and expanded 20 basis points to 33.2% for the nine-month period. But for the Lending transaction, segment margin would have been up by 120 and 160 basis points in the quarter and year-to-date periods respectively.","The adjusted corporate operating loss was up $6 million in the quarter, due primarily to a difficult prior-year compare, but fully in line with our plan and consistent with the 2018 run rate.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was slightly better than our expectations at 19.7%, due largely to a discrete tax benefit realized in the quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate through September was 20.7%. And we continue to focus on strategies to sustainably lower our tax rate. And accordingly, we now expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be just below 22%.","We continued to deliver significant free cash flow, generating $813 million for the first nine months of the year. Free cash flow conversion was better in the quarter at 104%, nearly double the rate from Q2, and is now 86% for the nine months this year. The results for the year have been pressured by the combined impact of working capital timing and the impact of ASC 606. Now, given our viability into Q4, we expect to be around the low end of our free cash flow conversion rate outlook for the full year.","We repurchased 5.6 million shares in the quarter for $438 million and have returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through September 30. We have now exceeded for the first nine months of the year the total amount repurchased in all of 2017. We had 34.9 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization, which includes a new authorization for 30 million shares approved in the quarter. We had 401 million shares outstanding as of September 30.","During the quarter we issued $2 billion of new 5 and 10-year notes at a blended rate of 4% and an average maturity of 7.5 years. We used those proceeds to pay off our term loan, retire our $450 million, 4.625% interest rate bonds that were due in 2020, and pay down our revolving line of credit. Although interest expense will increase sequentially in the fourth quarter and next year, it was a great opportunity to lock in attractive rates ahead of an upward trending market.","Also, because we completed the 2020 note payoff in October, our balance sheet at quarter's end did not fully reflect the results of the refinancing. Lastly, we extended the term of our revolving line of credit through 2023 and used it to finance the Elan acquisition, which closed earlier today.","Our long-term debt, excluding the revolver, is now entirely fixed rate. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.4 times at the end of the quarter, which does not reflect the retirement of the 2020 note. Had that been completed as of September 30, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA would have been 2.2 times.","Now with that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Sales performance in the quarter was off a bit more than expected, coming in at 69% of quota, and declined 29% from the prior year. The sizable amount of the decline came from two large, long-tenured transactions in the prior-year period. Normalizing for contract term only, sales would have been down by 13% in the period. Year-to-date book sales are down 8%, but up 1% when adjusting for the term differential. Quota attainment for the year to date was 80%. The domestic pipeline continues to grow and is up 30% over the prior year. We expect very strong sales in the fourth quarter.","We continue to make excellent progress on our operational effectiveness initiatives. We achieved another $13 million of savings in the quarter and are at $45 million attainment for the first nine months of the year. We now expect to exceed our annual goal of $50 million of savings.","The financial services environment remains strong, with rising interest rates, positive tax momentum, and a benign credit landscape. We continue to see meaningful demand in areas where we have invested, such as consumer and commercial digital, risk management, and real-time payments. The Zelle opportunity remains robust as the industry looks to claw back the P2P space and create technology optionality for the future. M&A remains active as financial institutions continue to focus on gaining scale and increasing deposit balances, which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future.","As we said up front, we remain on track to achieve our key financial objectives for 2018, which includes an increase in our internal revenue growth rate to at least 4.5% for the year. As a reminder, for comparison, last year's fourth quarter was our strongest internal revenue growth quarter of the year.","We also expect to achieve our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. Given where we are in Q4, we now expect the full year to be in a range of $3.10 to $3.15, strong growth of 25% to 27% over the adjusted $2.48 last year, and $0.08 higher than the bottom of the original range of $3.02 to $3.15.","You will recall that our full-year results anticipate incremental investments funded from tax reduction savings of at least $25 million for the full year. As Bob indicated, we now expect full-year adjusted operating margin to be around 10 basis points and free cash flow conversion to be about 106% for the year.","In conclusion, we're pleased with our year-to-date performance and our progress in building your company. Internal revenue growth is 5% and well ahead of last year's comparable growth rate. Adjusted EPS is up a very strong 26%, supported by operating leverage and operational effectiveness program benefits, and also includes incremental investments to further sustain competitive advantage.","As important, we continue to allocate capital to build value for shareholders, including a record pace for share repurchase, an enhanced debt structure, and the acquisition of Elan's debit assets in a move to deliver incremental value for both clients and shareholders.","We also remain committed to a continuous 360-degree view of excellence. Last month, we received the results of our annual associate engagement survey and, after recording a fifth straight year of improvement, have now crossed into the top quartile of associate engagement of the participating employers and their more than 3.5 million employees. And while we aren't done yet, we are grateful to the 24,000 Fiserv proud associates who bring their best every day for the company, its clients, and you, our shareholders.","With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",". The first question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, good afternoon. I'd like to start with a question about the Elan Financial Services acquisition. Thanks for giving the revenue from Elan. Could you break out what expected EBITDA will be on an annual basis?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","David, thanks for the question. Good afternoon. Overall, as you heard in our prepared remarks, that business will add about $170 million of revenue to us. We're just now closing as of this morning, so it will be a nominal impact for the 2018 results in fourth quarter. And when we get into 2019, we'll certainly incorporate that in our overall guidance.","It's a nice business for us. It's right up the alley of what we do in our debit card processing business today, and as Jeff pointed out in his prepared remarks, gives us some really nice opportunities for synergies over the next couple of years from a cost synergy standpoint as we bring that scale into our existing debit processing platform and over the next four years or five years to drive some meaningful revenue synergies. So we're looking forward to getting that business online and driving that revenue and cost synergies over the next four years or five years.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, David, to the exact question of will we provide EBITDA, the answer is we don't give that kind of a breakdown, as I know you know. But I would say that we would expect that business to maintain margins consistent with our debit processing business. Especially as we migrate, as Bob mentioned, we migrate it over to our platform over the next couple of years, we're moving from having they run on their own platform through U.S. Bank. We're going to obviously migrate them to our platform. So we think that there are meaningful cost synergy benefits that will come in. One of the reasons why we're saying it's moderately accretive next year is obviously we'll be moving that forward as we migrate clients over to our platform.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. And then on the third quarter earnings call last year, you gave a preliminary 2019 earnings outlook of $3.50 a share on a split-adjusted basis. Based on what you see in terms of the underlying margin expansion of the business, bookings, revenue trends, is that $3.50 outlook still intact for 2019?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So I would say Bob is making sure that he gives me the normal look. I think what we told you is specifically we were not giving guidance, but based on what we could see at the time that we expected to be in that range. I would say that nothing has changed since we talked about that previously to where we are today, I would say with one exception, and that is, as Bob mentioned, we did a fairly meaningful refinance in the quarter, and that's going to add some additional interest expense, which we expect to cover the same way we cover everything else from an operating perspective.","I'm not saying we won't be there and I'm not saying we will be there, but I am saying that that's the one thing that I can think that's a little bit different than it was when we talked last time. Conversely, we've acquired Elan. We expect that to be accretive. So I think when we give guidance, we'll be giving guidance that's consistent with what we have been saying all along.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Got it, and then just a quick final question for me. At Money20\/20, MasterCard debuted new Bill Pay Exchange offering, and I'm just curious. If you compare that on a feature functionality basis to CheckFree's core bill pay offering, how does it stack up? Is this a significant competitive threat, or not so much?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Not so much.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","And why would that be?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","It's not so much. As you know, that technology has been a market-leading technology for a long time. And the beauty in our technology is the data. Not only can we move money at any speed consistent with what a consumer wants, but we know how to perfect the payment and we know how to manage risk on those payments. And so we are able to take money out of accounts when the consumer wants it because we have a risk model, a patented risk model that allows us to make smart, intelligent decisions on that basis.","But the most important part is we know how to make sure the money goes where it's supposed to go, even if the consumer who will occasionally tell us the wrong thing. So we just think it's a more advanced technology. By the same token, we all see a very significant opportunity to electronify the nearly half of the bill payments each year that still are not moving on an electronic rail. So we're glad others are talking about it, but we believe right now we maintain a meaningful and important strategic and competitive advantage.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. How's it going?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Good, Dave. How are you?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Good afternoon.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good, thank you. So I guess first of all, I'm just wondering, so Q3 revenue is a little lighter than we thought. Was there some periodic revenue maybe that's moving into Q4? Because Q4 seems almost a little better than we thought and margins in Q3 were a little weak, and usually that periodic revenue carries pretty high margins. Is that what's happening here?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes, and you know well that periodic revenue comes in when, to a large degree, it decides it wants to come in. In Q2, remember, we said we had a little bit of a pull from Q3 to Q2. In Q3, we actually have it shifting from Q3 to Q4. And so because of the margins, that also follows. So we do expect \u2013 I think we tried to give a little clarity last quarter when we indicated we expected the first half and the second half to be substantially similar, and we're absolutely on track for that. So nothing other than the shift in revenue \u2013 sorry, the periodic revenue, as you know.","And then the other piece on margin, just to add a little bit more clarity, if you look at the last three years, Q3 has been our weakest margin quarter. And most of that, to your question, comes from movement of periodic revenue between quarters. And it just so happens that Q3 tends to be an unusually weak periodic revenue quarter for some reason.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And I guess how much down was it year over year in Q3?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","It was not down meaningfully in the quarter to the prior. It was down relative to our expectations for how the periodic revenue would flow through the year.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","David, if you think about it, we had a good first quarter. We had a very strong second quarter, to Jeff's point. Some of that was timing of periodic revenue actually shifting out of third quarter. We ended up in the first half of the year at 5%. We expected the second half to be similar in growth rate in total versus first half. And expect Q3 to be the strong quarter within the half, with Q4 being a little bit lighter given the tougher comp in the fourth quarter. That's still the case, but we'll be more normalized because Q3 came in a little bit lighter and Q4 will be a little bit stronger, but it's a shift within quarters. It's not a year-over-year thing per se.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you, and just one quick follow-up. The $3.10 to $3.15 this year includes a little bit, I think a couple months of the Lending business in the first quarter. So you lose that next year. Is Elan, the benefit from Elan, the accretion from that bigger than the Lending EPS that you lose next year?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","No, the Lending income, operating income in the first quarter of 2018 will be a little bit stronger than the first quarter from Elan in 2019. It's a little bit bigger business.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay, thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question here this afternoon.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I actually have a couple, if I may. Jeff, and maybe both of you guys could actually weigh in. You call out investments, and you do so consistently and maybe a little bit more so this quarter than others. Could you just talk a little bit about IRR thresholds or philosophy in terms of how you deploy and when you deploy capital to reinvest in the business?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So philosophically, the investments that we make, we think more about the capital trade-offs as opposed to maybe a traditional IRR. So if we're going to make incremental investments, we think about how does that compare to share repurchase, just like we would with an acquisition, and how does that end up impacting our competitive position in the market? The problem with IRR is you can do lots of things with terminal value to make the IRR be whatever you want it to be. And so we tend to stay away from that as a metric unless we're doing very large, very large incremental allocations of capital, which we are not.","The reason why we referenced it in this quarter, and maybe a little bit more to your perspective, is because the margin was a little bit lighter in the quarter than I think people expected, we were trying to call out this idea that that $25 million pool, that at least $25 million, the third quarter was the first quarter in which that really started to hit. We'll have an even bigger hit coming in next quarter. And so pointing that out and also looking for other opportunities to invest in a year where, frankly, we're going to deliver 25% to 27% EPS, looking for ways to expedite investments in technology or feature function we think is the right way to think about capital overall.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. So in the context of sustained earnings growth and organic revenue growth, I guess?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","That's right. That's right, sustaining and hopefully increasing. Our strategy is to increase this year at the 4.5% is roughly an 80 basis point increase in internal revenue growth. Based on what we can see right now, we would expect to see some lift in that moving into 2019. Of course, that's not formal guidance, but we would expect to see that as we continue to move forward.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, if I may, recognizing that Elan is a lot about debit processing, you also, as you mentioned, acquired Money Pass and a managed services business. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about ATMs and generally how they fit into the bank's priorities and whether there's an opportunity for a third party like Fiserv that outsources just about everything else that community banks do to provide more outsourced services around ATMs?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. From our perspective, when we hear clients talk about how the digital world will intersect with the physical world, ATMs continue to be front and center in that device-centric type strategy. And so we're still seeing that, and we're actually hearing more people want to add sophistication to those ATMs. For us \u2013 and so given the scale that we have, over 3,000 clients who we \u2013 most of them we drive ATMs for as part of our EFT and debit proposition, we see this to be actually a pretty attractive incremental service, outsourced service that we can provide.","We have stayed away from services like that historically for two reasons. Number one, we didn't have the expertise. And number two, it takes a little bit more capital than we tend to use for going out and acquiring the ATMs. But just given how the world is morphing right now, we think it could make some sense, and we'll spend the next couple of years looking to see what can we add in terms of service offerings to those 3,000 clients.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good evening.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, you've led this company for many years. You've seen how it performs through various business cycles. Now, clearly there's a lot more focus right now on macro risk versus even three months ago when you last spoke with us. So I'm going to ask you what your thinking is at this point in time as far as how you would expect this company to perform if the U.S. economy moderates to some degree in the future, and then what operational leverage might you be able to pull in order to manage through the cycle.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So, Jeff, we are in a period where we are investing significantly in technologies that are linked up with digital \u2013 the digitization of financial services along with the need and soon to be mandate to move to a real-time monetary ecosystem. It's hard for me to see how either of those trends will moderate, even if the economy itself begins to slow a bit. So I think that based on where we are strategically, that will continue to be a fairly strong defensive play, as we have been in frankly all of the other cycles.","That said, if in fact we see a slowdown that starts to negatively impact financial services, I would expect us to be able to take steps, such as slowing down the investments. And one of the things, if you go back and look at our data, you'll see that we've meaningfully increased our level of spend as a percentage of revenue over the last three, five, seven years, and most all of that drives future internal revenue growth. We think one of the beauties of our model is we can pull that back as needed without impacting the current level of internal revenue growth and create incremental flow-through of free cash.","So I think we're pretty well positioned. We think about that all the time, as you might imagine. And we like the fact that we have that lever as well as I think we've demonstrated for the last 10-plus years a strong ability to reduce, rein in, and restructure our costs overall. We talk about it as operational effectiveness, and I'd expect us to be able to do more of that as well as needed.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens. Your line is now open.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good evening, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","How are you?","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","One question on Dovetail. That was an interesting acquisition to us, and it sounds like you guys got a couple of pretty big contracts. And I know that you serve a lot of very large banks, especially in bill pay. Any thoughts on in moving up market maybe in specific verticals or maybe even in core account processing? But is there a strategy about moving up market, or is this more about digital and immediate payments and you're just going maybe where the demand is right now?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","It's really a combination of both. We, Brett, as you know, have a number of large clients who work with us on bill pay. We also have a number of large clients who work with us on digital. And we see that interesting interaction to just open the door to allow us to come in and talk about how the rails are evolving, and that was the back strategy.","The other thing that you probably know is PEP+, which is the majority of the ACH in the U.S., goes over PEP+ today, is owned by us, and we see a nice fit between Dovetail and PEP+. So being able to help clients who we've served for years on payments modernize with Dovetail is also part of the strategy. So it's coming together. The market will move at the pace it moves. But we were pleased with the results in the quarter, and the pipeline looks good, and hopefully we'll continue to make that progress.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then also there's been a lot more focus, I think, on helping banks or banks looking to do more alternative deposit gathering, not necessarily having to own the deposit gathering function itself, using partners, things like that. Some of those were featured at Money20\/20. I know you guys do some of that. Can you just remind us of the various things you do, whether it's alternative lending, things like that? What kind of products given your digital focus have you been developing?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","The majority of the things that we're doing are on \u2013 certainly focused on lending we're doing work. As I mentioned, this is a little bit of an offshoot, but we're seeing more and more banks look to set up separate Internet brands to be able to go out and gather deposits. We do some work with some third parties who basically are brokering deposits across more of on a partnering and integration basis, who are moving deposits around the ecosystem. And then, as we mentioned, things around Immediate Funds, which is about attracting non-customers into branches, things like that.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great, that's what I needed. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks so much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Happy Halloween to you guys. I want to ask on your comment on the strong sales expectation for the fourth quarter. What type of \u2013 what do you see in the pipeline and being able to replenish the backlog and whatnot? I feel like I ask you this every year, Jeff, but is there a concept of budget flush maybe that might be beneficial?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","We do talk about it, as we should. You have the year-end budgets. That's always the case. Fourth quarters are always strong. We had some larger sales slip from Q3 to Q4. Part of the revenue movement from Q3 to Q4 is also due to some of those sales, so we have that. And we have \u2013 whether it is around the payment rail transformation, you've got a lot going on there, Zelle, DNA, a lot on the digital front, whether it be Architect or others. So the same kinds of trends but I think also connected to the urgency of we've got to get it done this year so we can spin the project off and get going for next year.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay, that's good. So my follow-up on the margin front, you covered a lot of it, I know. But just to be clear on my side, is the incremental change in the margin outlook, is it Elan? Because the tax reinvestments I know you contemplated, maybe the timing wasn't contemplated. I'm just trying to better understand what changed.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. Are you talking about from being 10% to 30% to going to saying it's going to be about 10%?","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. What's incremental to get to the 10%?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","There are a couple of things. I would say the biggest one is the acquisitions that we brought in last year as well as the impact of Elan. They're ramping a little bit slower. The sales cycles took a little longer. So instead of us signing X deals, we signed Y deals. So things like that around the acquisitions, I would say that's one. Elan will be moderately dilutive as well.","And then you've got the incremental investments. That was due to tax reform. We've been looking for, given how the year is progressing, are there some incremental investments we can make that none of them are material by themselves but just a few million here and a few million there, not to diminish a few million, but it adds up and it has a basis point impact. So it's really those kinds of things.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks for that clarification. I appreciate it.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just returning to the question of sales for a moment, I think you talked about some of the slippage from Q3 to Q4. But I think on a full-year basis or year to date, the core attainment still feels a little bit light. Is that just the size of the deals?","And maybe can you maybe address the whole topic of competitiveness of new deals? Because some of the sales commentary from some of your peers seems quite robust over the past couple quarters. So I just wanted to square those two issues.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So the answer to the first part of the question was really around larger deals were the ones that were slipping, so they have an impact. We mentioned the fact that we had the term adjustment, which had an issue on our comparative sales. I think as squaring it, we are seeing a very robust sales environment. Pipeline is up 30% year over year, and it's both strong at the late stage as well as in the early stage.","I think we probably give a bit more information than others in terms of exact percentages and things like that. So it's a little bit easier to see how our quantitative data ends up playing out. I would also agree that the 80% is a little bit light. But again, we're expecting a very strong fourth quarter and think we'll be quite well positioned for next year.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's good to hear. And then maybe just on the financial side, free cash flow was actually down slightly year to date, and you talked about some of the factors that are driving that and some of the investments I assume that are playing into that. Can you maybe talk about as we head into 2019, what levers you're able to pull to get that free cash flow back up to where it normally would be? And is that an issue of conversion percentage, or is it an issue of lower CapEx as a percent to revenue or maybe some of the factors there, please?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Jim. It's Bob. We are nominally down just a couple million dollars, a few million dollars, on an $800 million year-to-date number. The largest driver of the year-over-year performance is the Lending divestiture, and that's a business that generated good cash that we don't have anymore. So it's in our last year numbers, we didn't adjust or make any modifications to last year's actuals. So that's probably the biggest driver.","You saw in our third quarter numbers the conversion rate jumped up very nicely to 104%. We've been a bit behind. The overall year-to-date conversion rate is not what we would typically expect, and that's really driven by timing of working capital as well as CapEx spending. Some of those investments that we've talked about with that reinvestment of the tax savings is also bringing capital spending. So that will moderate into next year. We expect to have a very strong fourth quarter and hit the bottom end of guidance range of the 106% for this year and be in good shape into 2019 and beyond.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","But just to clarify as it relates to the cash flow itself, it's really a matter of the Lending business a little bit more CapEx, things that should come back to a more normalized route.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good evening, Jeff and Bob.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Jeff, as you look at the backlog of the business, the sales you're anticipating in the fourth quarter, what percentage of revenue is already \u2013 I hate to use this word, but in the bag for 2019, and what do you still have to backfill?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So on balance, our recurring revenue is in the 80% to 85% range depending on what year you're in. So I think that's a reasonable proxy to say, certainly that's using the notion of in the bag. I think that's a fair way to think about it. But we also have line of sight into a whole bunch of additional revenue above that recurring revenue number. So it's a fairly small number ultimately that is in the go get category. But even if it's 5%, it's $300 million and change. And because $10 million is a point in a quarter roughly, Bob is going to tell me it's really $12 million.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Roughly.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","But it's in that range, you can have those shifts just because of the $25 million to $30 million a month that is in that 5% range.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And then, Bob, just the tax rate for 2019, do you anticipate it to be similar to 2018, or are there things that might change for 2019?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","No, we came out with original guidance of 22% to 23%, and I would think that is a more normalized rate. This year we'll dip just below that given some of the discrete tax items we had. But of course, we're always looking for that type of thing. It's one of the things we pointed out in the prepared remarks. That's an expense line that we look to manage, but 22% to 23% is a long-term normalized rate for us.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citibank. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, Jeff. Hey, Bob.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Happy Halloween.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Okay.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You guys gave a lot of good color on sales. I appreciate that. I guess larger deal slippage, I mean that happens. But larger deals also tend to be competitive in many ways. So I guess the question is if the deals p\\and ramps push out more if you suppose don't win, can that affect your internal growth rate, or do you believe this year's internal growth rate is a good assumption thinking ahead into future quarters?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","That \u2013 I'm pausing because sure, these larger deals and smaller deals tend to have a competitive element. The pipeline that we're talking about that is up 30% is actually weighted on the basis of our belief that we will prevail or not. Now, things happen and sometimes you lose transactions that you don't think you're going to lose. And certainly if we lost a bunch of things that we were expecting to win, it could have an impact on revenue this year and, frankly, next year. I think that's always the case.","We feel pretty good about where we are right now in that we'll achieve the at least 4.5% internal revenue growth. But to sustain that over time, obviously we have to continue to win. And we'll make sure that we're doing what we need to do from a product and a go-to-market perspective to ensure we're winning.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it, right. And then on the debt, paying up to ensure a fixed rate, to me it's in some ways a bullish sign because it probably implies that you think the win rate will continue to improve, and that would imply things for the spending environment and things like that. I guess is that a fair hypothesis in terms of as you speak with bank executives with regards to what you're hearing about spending intentions for technology and so on and so forth? And then a quick question at the end of that. What is the new cost of debt?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So let me take the \u2013 even though I know the answer to the last one, I'm going to let Bob take that, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","The spending environment is quite bullish. Right now, everyone in financial services knows that technology investments have to continue to be made to keep up with what is going on, on the digital transformation front. So there's lots going on there. There's still a ton going on around cyber, other kinds of risk, and then in the whole notion of just payments revitalization. So there's a lot of that going on.","Most of those \"decisions\" have been made to do things. Now it's a matter of finding the right partner, making the decision, making sure they have the right resources in their own shops to get this done. One of the constraints is do the financial institutions have resources on their own side, not just us, but to pair up to be able to get things done. But there's a lot of energy and focus.","And in fact, I would say that there is a higher level of motivation now to get things done because people can see what's on the other side of the wave, and what's on the other side of the wave is this intersection of digital and payments, money movement, new financial experiences, all of that. And we haven't even begun to talk about cognitive technologies, RPA, and where that's all going to go. And in order to do that, you have to get some of the other legacy systems cleaned out. So it's pretty good from that perspective, pretty bullish overall.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","And, Ashwin, I'm going to answer your question on the cost of debt. After this refinancing, we're just under 3%, about 2.9% after tax.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it, very good. Can I squeeze one last one in just to get a full explanation on \u2013 you mentioned the acquisitions have had a slow ramp. Is that \u2013 was that a product issue, or what led to the slow ramp?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I'm sorry, Ashwin. Which product are you talking about?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, no. When you said the acquisitions that have had a slow ramp.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Acquisitions. I'm sorry. I thought you said something \u2013 I thought you said activations. It's all about sales cycles. So it's about how long \u2013 so we announced a couple of Dovetail payments platform transactions. It's about how the sales cycles have gone in terms of how long it took for people to get comfortable that we were going to continue to invest and win. And then just the cycles on the client side took a little bit longer. So that idea is the main slowdown that we've seen relative to what we expected to happen. Does that make sense?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That makes sense, yes.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Okay","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, got it. Thank you.","Jeffery W.

Yabuki","Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. Results for the second quarter were solid, inline with our expectations and on-tract to achieve our full-year financial outlook. And as you saw in our press release we also moved up bottom end of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.03.","Adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter was 3% against our most typical revenue comparison of the year. Adjusted operating margin was 30.6% at increase of 10 basis points over the last year\u2019s quarter and up 100 basis point sequentially. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% over the last year second quarter. We feel very good about our results for the first half of the year.","Adjusted internal revenue growth through June 30, 4% compared to only 2% in the first half of last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the first six months is up 15% and free cash flow per share is up 16% both of which reflects our commitment to growth through high quality revenue. Sales through June 30 are up 5% of the same period last year. Our pipeline is growing at a strong clip and we are poised for stronger performance in the second half of the year.","Now let me update you on our enterprise priorities. As a reminder, our three focus areas for the year or first to continue building high quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings commitments. Second extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third to deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients.","To our first priority we are building momentum through high quality internal revenue growth expanding margin and growing free cash flow per share. We delivered 3% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter against our toughest revenue comparison of the year and are now 4% for the first half. Payments that our internal revenue growth performance with 5% and 7% growth for the quarter and year-to-date respectively.","Adjusted EPS is up 15% year-to-date over the last year strong earnings result. Execution is solid across the business. Through June 30, we achieved a 60 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin and 16% increase in free cash flow per share. All this as we continue to invest in your company. We are well on track to achieve our 29th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.","Our second priority is to extend market momentum to deep in client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. We had over 4000 attendees Fiserv form, one of our two primary client conference in May. This event which is to become one of the largest in the entire FinTech industry is proving to be an important opportunity for clients to network with other industry leaders. Exchange ideas and gain insights into market and industry trends.","As important form is a great opportunity to showcase our market leading solutions and latest innovations to decision makers, prospects and industry pundits. At last year\u2019s conference one of the solutions introduced to our clients was our ASP tablet banking solution, which enables financial institution to provide a differentiated experience to the more than 60 million tablet banking user in the U.S today. Since then 16% of our Mobiliti ASP clients have begun to offer the solution.","At this year\u2019s event, we introduced Mobiliti business which goes live this year. This ASP solution allows our financial institution clients to provide their business customer with the compelling suite of mobile capabilities such as remote deposit capture, entitlements, payment initiation and approval. Interest is very strong across nearly 1200 institutions using our business online services today.","We are excited about helping our clients address the digital need to this strategically important customer segment. We expect to see meaningful revenue growth from this user based subscription offering over the next several years. During the quarter, we also signed an additional 72 institutions to Mobiliti for a total of nearly 1900 mobile clients. Mobiliti ASP subscribers have grown more than 175% year-over-year to 2.2 million subscribers which is also up about 15% sequentially.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients. In the quarter, Australia based Westpac bank were the largest financial institutions in the world, was recognized as having the leading online and digital design for its transformative digital platform built by Fiserv. This prestigious award known as the Good Designer Award evaluates technology- technologies across all industries not just banking and Westpac solution was selected as a winning design for 2014.","There are new corillian based online banking service branded as Westpac live is a one of a kind solution utilizing the state-of-the design principles coupled with modern technology to provide a consistent, simple, helpful and secured omni-channel customer experience through a single platform. We continue our focus on real-time money movement as a way to drive meaningful differentiation in client value. We are building a new type of payments ecosystem using several of our leading solutions to create a one of a kind network that allows end-user to simply and easily use payment speed to their advantage.","At our most investor day we presented a number of targeted strategies to accelerate growth outside the U.S over the next several year. Earlier this month we launched Agiliti, a cloud-based retail bank technology solution. This modularized account processing based solution is designed to enable new players as well as existing institution better mange their technology cost, rapidly bring products to market, enhance the digital experience and overall enable institutions to focus their effort on serving customers.","We've teamed up with Anthony Thomson, the co-founder and former Chairman of Metro Bank, and the Chairman and co-founder of the Financial Services Forum to combined UK-based expertise and credibility to this new powerful solution. In a very short period we've seen strong demand leading to commitments for multiple institutions including Think Money Limited to use our new solution. Agiliti as scheduled to go live in mid-2015.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Thomas J. Hirsch","","Thanks, Jeff and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter. Our adjusted internal revenue growth rate was 3%, solid results given the difficult prior-year compare and the strength of our first quarter\u2019s performance. For the first half of the year adjusted revenue was $2.3 billion and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% a meaningful acceleration over the prior year's growth rate up 2%.","Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 4% to $360 million and for the first six months was up 7% to $702 million. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 10 basis points over the prior-year to 30.6% an increase of 100 basis points sequentially. ","For the first six months, adjusted operating margin is up 60 basis points compared to the prior year, driven primarily by growth in our scale businesses and operational efficiencies including open synergies. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.81 in the quarter, and for the first half of the year is up 15% to $1.63, both compared to the prior year period.","Now, onto the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the payment segment increased 5% to $591 million in the quarter, and for the first six months increased 7% to $1.2 billion, with only $2 million of acquired revenue year-to-date. Strength in our larger recurring revenue businesses such as card services, bill payment and channels along with good performance from output solutions drove the majority of the revenue growth.","The decrease from the growth rate was primarily due to the more difficult second quarter compare, the annualization of a large client win at the end of the first quarter and a negative impact from the Biller headwinds, we shared with you earlier in the year, which stem primarily from client acquisitions. We signed 88 new bill payment clients in the quarter and 170 through June 30.","Bill payments transaction volume grew 3% in the quarter and 5% in the first six months. Strong new client growth was partially offset by the anniversary of our largest 2013 bill payment implementation in the first quarter and continued soft transaction volumes and our largest client.","We expanded a number of member institutions in the Popmoney network in the quarter. And now have over 2,200 institutions contracted to offer these services. Transactions were up 73% in the quarter and we continue to see important growth opportunities in particular, as clients enable real-time capabilities for their customers. We have a strong pipeline for Popmoney instant including notable opportunities with several top 50 financial institutions to join the more than 170 financial institutions signed today.","Debit transaction growth was 11% in both the second quarter and the first half of the year. We added 26 new debit clients in the quarter and assigned 56 for the first six month for the year. New sales better than market transaction growth and value added services combined to drive strong continued revenue growth in our card services business. Payment segment adjusted operating income was up 3% in the quarter to $185 million. And year-to-date adjusted operating income increased 6% to $365 million compared to the prior year periods.","Adjusted operating margin the segment increased 70 basis points on a sequential basis, to 31.3% in the second quarter, but down 70 basis points compare to the prior year, which was our highest overall margin quarter over the last four years. Through June 30, segment adjusted operating margin was down 30 basis points, the 30.9% over the prior years high watermark.","Margin performance was driven by was driven by operating leverage in our scale businesses, offset by continued investment in areas such as Mobiliti and biller advantage. The margin mix associated with higher revenue growth in output solutions and biller headwinds mentioned earlier.","Adjusted revenue in the financial segment increased 1% in the quarter to $596 million and as up 2% to 1.2 billion for the first six months for the year both compared with the prior year periods. The adjusted internal revenue growth rate in the segment of 1% in the quarter decline sequentially primarily due to lower growth from fee revenue, including license and termination fees and the expected weakness in our international business.","Adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date was primarily driven by growth in our account processing businesses. Partially offset by the timing of larger International client implementations in 2013 which created a very difficult year-over-year comparison. Which should abate as we go through the second half of the year?","Our large core account processing implementations including open solutions are progressing well. We expect increased revenue from these new clients across a variety of our market-leading solutions towards year-end and even more as we move into 2015. Adjusted operating income in the financial segment was up to 6% in the quarter to $203 million and is up 9% to $388 million through June.","Adjusted operating margin expansion in the segment was stellar up a 170 basis points in the quarter to 34.1% and up 200 basis points to 33.1% for the 6-month comparable period. Results were driven by growth in our account processing businesses, benefits our operational efficiencies, higher termination fees partially offset by International headwinds. The adjusted operating launch in the corporate segment for the second quarter was $28 million the increase in expenses was primarily due to the implementation of a new HR system, rolling out during the second and third quarters of this year. Along with the time enough expenses associate with our spring client conference.","Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was up 36% higher than the prior year\u2019s adjusted rate, primarily due to the impact of the non renewal of the R&D tax credit in 2014. Through June 30 our effective tax rate of 33.1% was lower than the prior year with a difference driven by the timing of discreet tax benefits recorded in the first quarter of 2014.","We expect the adjusted effective tax rate in the second half of the year to be higher than the first half and that our full year tax rate excluding the tax impact from StoneRiver Capital transactions will be under 35%. We received a $45 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture in the quarter which is excluded from our free cash flow performance.","The year-to-date adjusted ratings contribution from StoneRiver decreased by $6 million or a $0.02 negative EPS impact as StoneRiver continues to opportunistically monetize its business portfolio. The performance of this equity investment has been exceptional; in fact since the formation of the StoneRiver venture in 2008, Fiserv has received total cash payments in excess of $850 million.","We continue to see attractive growth in free cash flow as one of the outcomes of our focus on high-quality revenue. Free cash flow for the first six months of the year reached nearly $400 million, increasing 10% over the prior year period. This performance again which does not include the $45 million from StoneRiver, translated to $1.54 in free cash flow per share, a very strong 16% increase. ","Total debt at June 30 was $3.8 billion or 2.3 times our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 3 million shares of stock in the quarter for $168 million. Through June 30, we have deployed $519 million repurchasing 9.1 million shares at an average cost of $57 per share. This is double the allocation of capital the share repurchase compared to the first half of 2013. At quarters end there were 249.1 million outstanding and 9.4 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","With that I will turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks Tom. Sales for the quarter were a bit lighter following up on a very strong Q1; we attained 80% of our quota in the quarter and are now at 88% year-to-date. As you will recall, we have increased our sales targets in each of the last several years, importantly actual sales value through June 30 is still up 5% over last year\u2019s level. Our sales results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the timing of several larger transactions that slipped out of Q2 and signed early in the third quarter.","As an example, we completed a large sale in July, with total contract value of more than $50 million to a top 10 financial institution to service a large share of their substantial consumer loan portfolio. We are excited about this new relationship and expect the solution to go live late in 2015. Our June 30 qualified pipeline is up 19% since the start of the year, the strength is coming primarily form continuing momentum in large account processing transactions.","Early traction in our focus international strategies and progressively larger transactions across our solutions, also DNA platform sales were again strong with six new clients signed in the quarter. Since we acquired the business last year, we have added 44 new clients to DNA and we fully expect that momentum to continue.","Integrated sales were $50 million in the quarter and totaled $102 million for the first half of the year. Card services, bill payment and Mobiliti led the integrated sales performance in the quarter. Through June 30, nearly 20% of our integrated sales a four fold increase over the same period last year have come from the DNA client base.","We are on track to achieve our $250 million integrated sales target for the year. We\u2019ve also realized $37 million of operational effective in the saving in the first six months in the year or 62% of our $60 million annual target. The strong results are driven by Open Solutions cost synergy attainment and operational improvements.","Going forward, we expect the growth in the incremental savings associated with Open Solutions to slow as we h ave substantially completed our cost focused integration efforts beyond the data center consolidation. We remain well-positioned to meet our operational effectiveness objective for the year.","The environment continues to show stability in the quarter. There were non-regulatory actions in the period and 15 year-to-date, a decrease of 40% compared to the first half of last year. We are also seeing healthy M&A activity in the market which we view as a generally positive sign.","Technologies spend continues to be focused on cost effectiveness, digital experience and regulatory compliance. While we do not expect overall technology spend for the year to increase over our original estimates. Institutions remain committed to their spending plans, which is an improvement over the trailing off we have seen over the last few years.","Lastly, we continue to see a strong interest by financial institutions in solutions that can help generate new revenue. As I mentioned up front, we are well on track to achieve our full year financial outlook. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 5% and adjusted internal revenue to grow 4% to 4.5% for the year. And for reference we expect termination fees in the second half of the year to be about flat to last year\u2019s level.","Based on the strength of our first half results and what we can see for the remainder of the year. We\u2019ve increased the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.03 per share. We now expect adjusted EPS to grow in a range of 11% to 13% or $3.31 to $3.37 per share. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand at least 50 basis points for the full year.","And finally, we expect free cash flow per share to increase by at least 10% or greater than $3.65 for the year. We're at a strong position as we entered the second half of the year. We are executing well in our core businesses and are extending our momentum in areas of new and existing market demand.","We are progressing on our journey to steadily increase our adjusted internal revenue growth rate through the addition of high-quality revenue. We are on plan for the year and believe our growth momentum will continue into 2015. Our achievements are not accidental. We have the benefit of 21,000 associates around the world who care deeply about clients, are meeting commitments and remain focused on delivering innovation and excellence each and every day.","With that, let\u2019s open the line for question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Paul Condra from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Paul J Condra \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.","","Hi, Great thanks for taking my call. Strong quarter.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","","Thank you, Paul.","Paul J Condra \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.","I thought I would ask first about the DNA implementation, I just wondered is there anything with timing that we should be paying attention to or any change to that rollout.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","","No. I mean we are on-track on those implementations. We mentioned we've got 44 wins so far. We had right around 30 last year and those are tracking well and those will begin to go live really in the second half of this year and more towards the and then well into 2015 and at this pace we would expect that to continue beyond 2015. So it\u2019s right on track.","The great news, Paul that I would add to that is it's not just the DNA implementations, but the amount of revenue uplift that we're seeing from surround solutions and in DNA base and the open base in particular, continues to be very positive. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that fully 19%, 20% of our add-on integrated sales in the quarter for the year-to-date have come from DNA client so we're quite pleased with that and we are just well on track.","Paul J Condra \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.","Okay great to hear. Thanks. Just following up, I wonder if you could talk a little broadly just about margin expansion quarter was strong, but I'm wondering if you can talk about how you balance kind of the revenue growth with margin expansion. Is there anything we should be paying attention to as you move internationally as well?","","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, it a great question. I would say that we have been very, very disciplined on focusing our energy on what we describe as high-quality revenue and that we describe that revenue as being generally recurring revenue, revenue that fits into our model, its things that we do for clients on an everyday basis and it tends to come that revenue tends to bring along attractive margins and frankly very high free cash flow characteristics. And as we've thought \u2013 and that's been our model in the U.S. and frankly we buy us to that, we would prefer to grow a little bit more measured, but grow in that way as opposed to achieving growth for growth's sake.","And we've taken the same formula outside the U.S. and when we shared at Investor Day last year, the areas in which we were focused on growing this account processing cloud cloud-based solution that we talked about called Agiliti, right that\u2019s outsourced account processing. We know how to do that we're building a scale, a scale model and we're focused on that and it's payments and channels which we define as mobile and online.","All things that we do today, things that we think have those \u201chigh quality\u201d revenue growth characteristics and that's really where our focuses is has been and we will continue to be.","Paul J Condra \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.","","Okay, that\u2019s it for me thanks a lot.","","Jeffery W. Yabuki","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc","","Thanks, guys. Tom maybe can you give us some more specific color on the one-time moving parts around the quarter especially with regard to the re acceleration of growth versus the first quarter levels? If you could just list them for us maybe help us understand what impact they actually had on the payments and financial growth rates as well as maybe the margins in the quarter?","Thomas J. Hirsch","","Yes, are you talking about one-time fees, Darrin?","Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc","Yes, I guess I know there was a lot of noise around grow over right I think alluded to in your prepared remarks. So, that the comps were harder maybe just give us the components to that? And then may be if there's any other one-time items, how those impact at the growth rate and what those growth rates would be sort of more normalized for any segment?","Thomas J. Hirsch","I'll start with that then turn it back over to Jeff, but I think if you look at first quarter of 2013 we had 0% growth when you look back to last year and in the second quarter of last year, we actually had 4% growth, which was our strongest quarter last year in Q2. We had 7% growth in the payment segment and actually 2% financials. So, this is really when we look that the year, when we rolled out the year, this is our most difficult kind of comparison on a year-over-year basis.","So, we are very pleased with our second quarter results from a growth rate standpoint given that compare. We also have some annualization of our \u2013 like our largest bill pay client in the first quarter. We have difficult international comparisons in the first half of the year which will start rebating in the second half. And we have some momentum as we ended the second half and some of the larger core implementations.","In regards to what\u2019s you mentioned around one-time fees, we have had year-to-date for the first six months of the year, license and termination fees are up roughly about $15 million, Darrin and about a $11 million or so that was in the first quarter and about $4 million of that in the second quarter.","So again, we are little bit more benefit in the first quarter from those and less in the second quarter and that contribute a little bit to the deceleration when you look at compared to the first quarter, but as you know those fees bounce around Jeff indicate in his prepared remarks in the second half, license termination fees are probably going to be flat to the prior year and that just generally where we see that right now. So that would be from a high level and Jeff I don\u2019t know if you add anything to that.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, the only thing I would say Darrin is and we talk about this a lot in April when we shared our results from Q1. Maybe fully expected Q1 on a relative performance basis to be by far the strongest of the year, because as Tom mentioned we had zero compare. We expected this to be the hardest and so its worked out as we expected we are right on our internal plans and you know some of the significance of the performance delta that we had to get over versus last years Q2 and then the kind of the very strong Q1 makes it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to see the underlying growth kind of the puts and takes on that.","But we feel like we are going to see the re acceleration in the second half of the year on the segments just given the compare differential on a regular basis and then we are going of course add on some of the additional implementation that we have been talking about. So, again to summarize we think the year is looking exactly the way we though it would when we gave guidance at the beginning of 2014.","Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc","No, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks Jeff and Tom. But I think when we \u2013 the reason I mean to your point the reason I was asking is really to get what the normalized growth rate underlying it\u2019s really is and it sound like you know look in the first half of the year you are coming at 4% internal growth.","As you said of in your guidance is 4% to 4.5% but you are also looking for an acceleration as easier compares come about not to mentioned all the roll on from DNA and other businesses you won that are actually going to be generating revenue in the second half of the year.","So I guess just to that point your guidance being left of change 4% to 4.5%, when you are ready at 4% without the benefit of all these business that have yet \u2013 that are yet to roll on, is that some conservatism in our outlook are is there any sort moving parts, because it seems like that should add a fair amount of revenue versus the first half levels.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","","Yes, I would say there is one other thing we had talked in your member this well Darrin, we had talked at the beginning of the year that we would have headwinds coming from our Biller businesses and while we had some of those in the first half, we actually think that will actually grow a bit in the second of the year and trotting some of the growth that we would otherwise see flowing through to the bottom line.","But we would also if we talked about in terms of the elements of 15 we've got the large implementations that we talked about both in the core and on the bill payment side; we've got the benefits coming from open solutions, the International performance that Tom talked about in terms of that moderating life of Agiliti. Now again Darrin, I'm talking about going into 2015.","We are going to have those benefits \u2013 we've been quit pleased with how our pipeline has grown up 19% so far this year next coming on the heels of a number of \u2013 as you remember a number of large deals at the end of last year and a very, very strong first quarter. And then we also think we are going to have some benefits come through in 2015 relative to EMV.","There is been more discussion going on in EMV, we expect to have those benefits there and then we would hope that all of that or we would expect that all of that would turn into accelerated growth in to 2015 and an actually we believe that we will probably see our free cash flow move up to a little bit north of $1 billion next year, so again focused on growth acceleration in high quality way.","Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc","Okay that\u2019s helpful, just one last question I\u2019ll turn it back to the queue, on the margin side I mean you have very good expansion on the financial segment, the payment side was obviously down and not sure I quite caught the reason for that maybe it was due to some of these one time issues or maybe not, but just understanding the \u2013 maybe if you could answer that in the second half of the year, the margin again I mean when you roll on new business such as the DNA businesses that we've talked about, are those \u2013 how accretive is that to your margin when you actually start to execute and implement the business and start to generate revenue off of the work you have done over the past six months?","Thomas J. Hirsch","","Its high Darrin from a standpoint of again the scale that we have in those businesses, especially in our card services bill payments related businesses, so things that we had this year which we talked about briefly was we are investing more in areas like Mobiliti, Jeff mentioned a number of different \u2013 our tablet offering our Mobiliti business offering.","We also have Biller Advantage which was something that we acquired in our biller business that\u2019s we've invested in and then we've had a little higher growth associated with our output solutions business which has a little lower margin mix for that and also we talked a little bit about our biller headwinds, those are kind of hitting us here in the second quarter, in the second half a little bit from a standpoint of some client acquisition that we had and that\u2019s also impacting our margins.","So we have very good growth from a scale standpoint in those businesses as that revenue goes on, we have some investments that we are making in a number of different areas and that we have a little mixed differential of output and then that the biller had one that we kind of talked about to client acquisition. So that gives you a little flavor for what is going on.","Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc","Okay. Thanks very much guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks Darrin.","Operator","Thank you, David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","","Thanks good afternoon Jeff and Tom.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Hi David.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Hey David ","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","I apologize I joined the call a little from another call, but maybe you could just dig in a little bit on DNA, the uplift you are seeing in bookings to what extent do you think that\u2019s lets say an improvement in market demand versus share gains and to the extent it is share gains if you could give us some insight perhaps that you are head-to-head competitive win rates versus Scimitar which has long been your strongest competitor in the large credit union market.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So I would say that it is share gains in terms of we are winning more than our fair share of new clients, in fact DNA has quite strong win loss ratio when it\u2019s out \u2013 when we are out there competing against the market. For the most part we are not winning at the level certainly we would like to versus Scimitar we are winning more form other competitors and but you can be sure that we are very focused on what are the right ways for us to make sure that we win against all clients that are out there.","Frankly I would say David that we've won a lot of business, we are at in a roughly 44 wins on the DNA platform to-date since the time of acquisition. And frankly that\u2019s a lot of new business and there are clients that we know that are waiting on the side line waiting for us to have these clients go live and waiting for us to --- not waiting for us but waiting to see that we are able to service this significant demand.","So that is a very important element of how the competitive dynamic will play moving forward. We are very focused on operationally making sure that we get these clients live that they are happy and redeemable on day one, but the other thing that I would say that\u2019s quite important is DNA is not just a Credit Union platform, it is a very well respected platform on the bank side as well as on the Credit Union side.","In fact, you will remember that in Q1 we won a very large transaction called Washington Federal Bank which is now a $13 billion bank in the Pacific Northwest who bought the DNA platform and then bought basically our entire suite of surround. We are having a lot of success on the bank side as well as on the Credit Union side. So I'm actually quite confident that we will see both of those sides of the charter wars, we\u2019ll seen big wins coming \u2013 our big fair gains coming on both sides of that. And we believe we are the only provider in the industry who can offer a variety of platforms that meet the needs of individual institutions.","So DNA is not always the right platform and XP systems may not always be the right platform and Premier may not always be the right platform and premier may not always be the right platform or signature. We have platforms it meet the needs of the institution that can help them grow as they decide in terms of what is their strategic plan and how they prefer to do business.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","","That\u2019s very helpful, thanks for that. If I could just segway into your operational effectiveness performance 62% year-to-date, are you signaling that you are going to significantly outperform on that $60 million cost takeout target for this year?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Now, we continue to be on track, towards that David will continue to execute well. We knew the first half of its going to be a little stronger just in the standpoint of the open synergies were well on track to slightly exceed that target on a separate basis. So we are pleased with that and first half is going to be a little stronger because of those open synergy. So we are well on track for the year ago.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","","Got it and just a quick final question on the 88% quota payment for the year, where you expect to end up for 2014 is a whole?","Thomas J. Hirsch","100% I mean we expect the right on target, the pipeline is quite strong and we mentioned that we had \u2013 we really just had a couple of deals slip from the end of Q2 into Q3 we indicated that we had $50 million transaction close in July. So we are feeling quite good about that.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","","Right thank you very much.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks David.","Operator","Thank you. [indiscernible] from Robert W. Baird & Co., your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Sure, thanks Adam.","Unidentified Analyst","I think most of my questions have been answered, maybe if I could just ask about the bill pay transactions I know you called out the anniversary of the large client kind of contributing some of that deceleration, is it fair to look at this 3 percentage kind of a normalized run rate or with that client acquisition is that a headwind that might a floor that a little bit and then maybe if you could just talk about how revenue growth is kind of trending relative to the transaction growth.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yeah, sure Adam thanks. Let me start and Tom remark you can add to it. We do not believe the 3% would be the normalize run rate we have couple of things going on the quarter that Tom talk about we had this the annualization of our very large implementation last year, which has a little bit of a growth rate impact.","We have some trailing off of transactions again in the second quarter as we saw in the first quarter from our largest client and so that\u2019s going to have an impact. That\u2019s said we also have a serious of new clients that have been going alive we\u2019ve got a couple of larger implementation that I will go alive in the second half of the year buy us more toward Q4 and so we are excited about that \u2013 for that business when you look in the underlying \u2013 the underlying numbers, we had a number of clients that went live in the last year and a half or so, they are growing very nicely.","We've got a variety of different growth drivers around the industry and we are quite pleased with some of the expedited payment focus areas that we have, that we see accelerating growth. We got the integration between digital and our transactional capabilities, so we're happy with that as well.","And, as we talked about and Investor Day last year, this mid-market area we're really focused on in terms of bringing a combination of channels capability and payment capabilities to market really penetrating this odd segment of the market where we have not we're kind of below our level of market share. So we do know that in order for us to grow we got to be able to win, win transactions and also we're working on several things from a platform perspective that we believe will increase transactions.","And we hope I am sorry, we expect that transaction growth will end up increasing. We think it should be and it should follow consumer household transactions, that's an important element of our growth strategy and frankly our use and adoption strategy that we've articulated at our last Investor Day.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s truly helpful, and then maybe a little bit on revenue growth in this area is that sort of inline with transaction growth or some of these large clients maybe making that a little bit lower?","Thomas J. Hirsch","No, I would say overall we don't comment on kind of revenues for specific business, but it's \u2013 it can be a close approximator kind of indicator from that standpoint but there are many things that we work on to clearly maximize our revenue per transaction in our businesses and continue to focus on that. So I would say overall period of time is an indicator clearly and just one of those indicators, but that business continues to grow nicely for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Great thanks guys.","","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks you.","Operator","Thank you. Brett Huff from Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Good afternoon guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Hey Brett.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Two questions, one on Popmoney, can you give us a sense? I know it's still a small piece of revenue and I know it's growing rapidly, but can you give us a sense of how much \u2013 is it enough yet to be a meaningful part of the growth like can we talk about it being 50 basis points of growth? I mean anything like that or are we not there yet?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I would say that to your point it is growing rapidly it is scaling up, but I would say that it's still early to talk about it in terms of the direct \u201cPopmoney\u201d impact. We're actually seeing a lot very intriguing impacts on the real-time aspect of Popmoney, so we\u2019re seeing pretty intriguing changes in revenue per transaction and so a little bit to the last piece of the discussion. We\u2019ve got transaction growth and we also have rev for trend that's looking pretty interesting. But, I would say it's still early and it's premature in the scope of all of Fiserv just because of the sheer size of magnitude of the overall company.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","","And given, sort of second part of the question I forget what you said about how many you have installed and how many you have contracted to be installed. When you do that math and assume some average run rate of the kind of transactions in ARPU you see now on Popmoney and translate that into what is contracted and yet to installed after those installations happen does it reach I presume that will happen over the next year or however long they will, at that point does it reach enough of a threshold to start impacting sort of total company basis points growth that we could talk about?","Thomas J. Hirsch","","Yes, I mean, I think I would anticipate that if it's not 2015 it will be 2016, but I do think at that stage there will be enough momentum in the solution that it will then start to be breaking that out. And that's one of the things that we talked about as kind of a little bit of an optionality element to the Fiserv to a share of Fiserv stock.","Right now, it\u2019s not having any meaningful impact on our growth rate. But we do expect, going into 2015, certainly into 2016, with a combination of Popmoney the number of call it 2200 institutions as well as the real-time aspects, we do believe at that point we will see meaningful impact coming from that solution. And again, Brett our belief is that it won't be linear. Right that in fact that solution will grow, it will hit a tipping point and you'll see some significant growth come it, for a few years not unlike what you saw happened with our XP back in the day.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","","And then, just one last one on this any change in behavior on those institutions that have offered this relative to bill pay? Are we still paying some things in bill pay as a consumer and some in Popmoney? Are the use cases overlapping or are they remaining separate?","Thomas J. Hirsch","","The use cases are overlapping, but the way that the institutions are for the most part, presenting the capability, requires a little bit about siloed behavior.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","","Okay.","Thomas J. Hirsch","","But, the use case is Popmoney looks more or like a bill pay technology than it does a splitting dinner tab technology in terms of how the money is used. I mean we're working on a series of different use cases that we think intermediate those solutions and ways that we can make it easier for consumers to access that and we'll talk a little bit more about that into next year but, the manner in which it is presented to consumers does not way consumers use that technology today through their financial institution.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Great thanks for the detail guys I appreciate it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 Jefferies Group, Inc.","Thanks I guess is a follow up to that last sort of line of questioning, on the real-time payment capability I mean when you're selling in Popmoney to a new customer is there, is real-time something that is sort of can be backed into the sale or is it\u2019s a separate sales cycle and I guess is it also more complicated implementation real-time versus just sort on Popmoney?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So it\u2019s a good question. Back in the day, you may remember when we first started selling B2B we were really focused on building the networks so let get\u2019s that network as biggest as we can get as many institutions as we can and that's predated real-time. So now, we are needed to go back in and for institutions that have made there, Popmoney selection we're looking at adding real-time and today we have about wondered 170 different in Popmoney instant we call it Popmoney instant installations and that ranges from institutions in the top five down to institutions that are in the average community based institution.","So that is quote resale, when we are selling a new institution today and we are still selling may new institution today we look at bundling it together. So take Popmoney add-on Popmoney instant and by the way why you're doing that because you are in fact CheckFree RXP user, we would to make sure we add expedited payments in the bill pay.","In fact today we still only have, of our probably close to 3500 to 4000 institutions we still only have about 1600 of those institutions live on expatiated bill payment today. All of those kind of add-ons increased value that the financial institution is able to deliver their consumer and also changes the fees and which we're able to get paid. So, the bank gets paid and we get a slice of what that bank has paid. So we are really excited about that, because we see this intersection between bank or financial institution value consumer value and fee to us.","The second part of your question I believe was around is it a harder install? It\u2019 not a harder install, but it is an additional install and the institutions have to decide how do they want to take real time. Do they want to use card rails for rider do they want to use PEP+ or ACH technology on a real-time basis, do they want to do all of that.","Do they want differences and so that's the decision that the institutions are making and we're seeing institutions pick and choose based on how they are currently looking to basically wire the solutions together. I think by the middle of next year, the institutions wont be making those decisions, we will be providing them this real-time network, this real-time ecosystem that we talked about in our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll be routing those transactions in the way that makes the most sense for that financial institutions.","So we\u2019re very, very bullish about that activity, because not only are we bringing the real-time capability to bear, but we've got the actual application Popmoney, bill payment, TransferNow, all kinds of different products that consumers are able to very simply and easily initiate that payment transaction. And we aspire to have us an experience where it's really about the consumer making the choice of speed and not needing to do anything else, and write to their financial institution.","Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 Jefferies Group, Inc.","","Okay, got it. One quick follow-up for me. You mentioned bill pay performance that your largest client, still a bit softer than expected. I mean can you comment a bit on your expectations for maybe kind of turning that around are there any potential catalysts or any kind of mitigating factors or techniques that you can apply to kind of get that business moving in the direction you sort of expected?","Thomas J. Hirsch","","Yes, there are, you know we\u2019ve got a couple of issues going on in that client. You have that client in some cases, shedding branches or shedding accounts so it's difficult to do anything around that so you\u2019ve got a little bit of an organic loss that you have to deal with, but that client is very good at deciding it's going to push on bill payment and really extend bill payment into their base. And, we believe we\u2019ll have some opportunities to do that later on this year and we would expect that that would be another one of those tailwinds that are help push our growth rate up as we move through 2014 and into 2015.","Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 Jefferies Group, Inc.","","Great, thanks that's all for me.","Thomas J. Hirsch","","That\u2019s great. Thank you everyone. We appreciate you joining us today, if you have any questions or follow-ups, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great day.","Operator","","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect from the audio portion."],"9580":["Fiserv, Inc.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Tiffany Willis","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today for the call are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives, and the anticipated combination with First Data including expected benefits financial projections synergies financing and timing of as well as the ability to close complete the transaction.","Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Today's presentation is neither an offering of securities nor solicitation of a proxy vote. The information discussed today is qualified by the registration and joint proxy statement that Fiserv and First Data will be filing with the SEC.","You should review that information carefully. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.","Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are soon to be year-over-year comparisons. As a reminder, the share and per share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials, and comments are adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split completed in March of 2018 along with adjusting the comparable 2017 adjusted earnings per share amounts in each period for the sale of a majority interest of our Lending Solutions business, which also closed in March.","And with that, allow me to turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks, Tiffany and good afternoon everyone. As you know key elements of our shareholder value proposition are to steadily increase our internal revenue growth rate, convert that to growing streams of free cash flow, and last but certainly not least allocate that capital in a shareholder friendly way. We accomplished those objectives in 2018 and made important progress in building your company's future success.","We achieved an 80 basis point increase in our internal revenue growth rate for the year to 4.5% and also achieved our 33rd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Results in the quarter, which are consistent with our preliminary results announced on January 16, include 4.5% internal revenue growth and a 33.4% adjusted operating margin both against a very difficult prior year compare.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 24% to $0.84 in the quarter and up a very strong 25% to $3.10 for the year. We also generated an all-time high in free cash flow and allocated a record $1.9 billion to shareholders repurchasing more than 25 million shares for the year.","Sales were extraordinary in the quarter finishing more than 30% higher than last year's record sales including our largest account processing win ever enhancing our growth, profile entering the New Year.","Before we provide detail on the results let me make a few comments on our recent merger announcement with First Data, which we believe creates the preeminent global provider of payments and financial technology.","We expect this strategic transaction to move the industry forward in new and exciting ways. Early client reaction has been extremely positive and centered on the ways on which the combined solutions can come together to create unique value for them and their customers.","The model is compelling with leadership positions across multiple solutions and numerous ways to grow and prosper. We also intend to enable meaningful new client value along several axes through increased investments and strategic solutions, unique and compelling end-to-end integration, and as important, by identifying new and unique sources of value at the intersection of technology innovation and data.","We're approaching this opportunity with excitement as well as a steadfast commitment to excellence. We have kicked off integration planning and expect to hit the ground running when we close. Our priorities include unlocking client value capturing the meaningful synergies and retaining and attracting the best talent.","We have skilled experienced integration leaders driving the process accompanied by strong governance and oversight. We are highly confident we will achieve the incremental revenue synergies of $500 million and the $900 million in cost benefits shared in the original announcement.","In addition to this transformative transaction benefiting clients we are equally as focused on creating significant shareholder value. We expect to generate upwards of $4 billion of annual free cash flow over the next several years and we'll continue to use our disciplined capital allocation strategy to optimize value in the aggregate as well as on a per share basis. Our collective enthusiasm about the combination with First Data is even greater now than it was on the day of announcement.","With that, let's get back to reviewing performance and start against our 2018 key shareholder priorities. Our first priority was to continue to build high-quality revenue, while meeting our earnings commitments; next to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solution; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value to our clients.","As I mentioned, we continue to focus on high-quality revenue growth acceleration delivering 4.5% internal revenue growth in both the quarter and the year. The 80 basis point increase in our internal revenue growth rate for the year comes from multiple sources including the cumulative effect of adding recurring revenue with a direct link to client value.","We also expect another lift in our internal revenue growth rate for 2019. Our strong adjusted earnings per share performance was due to a combination of internal revenue growth tax leverage and operational effectiveness.","Our full year adjusted operating margin was below the prior year, primarily due to a 110 basis point headwind from the combination of the Lending transaction announced in March and the meaningful internal investments funded by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted last year. But for these items adjusted operating margin will have increased 80 basis points for the full year.","Our second priority was to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solution. Now, as you may have seen earlier today, we announced the largest new core account processing sales win in our history.","In a competitive takeaway, New York Community Bancorp Inc., the holding company for New York Community Bank with over $50 billion of assets and locations in five states selected DNA and a package of more than 40 solutions including debit processing, Corillian Online Banking, Mobiliti, Zelle and Dovetail to deliver differentiated high-value solutions to their customers. The combination of modern real-time technology with significant flexibility is allowing us to meet the changing needs of larger financial institutions.","DNA also continued its momentum with large credit unions, signing Fox Community's credit union with $1.6 billion of assets. Fox community selected DNA as their business had outgrown their existing core processing provider. DNA provides a platform for future growth, eliminates a number of third-party vendors and will allow Fox communities to continue serving their members with excellence.","Overall DNA performance was strong with 30 implementations for the year including 16 for institutions with assets greater than $1 billion. We also signed 29 new clients for the year which is indicative of the continuing momentum of DNA.","Equally important, we signed 30 new account processing clients to our market-leading Premier platform during the year. Interest also remains high for our digital and payment solutions such as Architect, Commercial Center and Dovetail. Bank of California with more than $10 billion in assets selected Architect and Commercial Center in the quarter to better meet the rapidly changing expectations of their retail and commercial customers.","Additionally both KeyBanc with over $130 billion in assets; and Bank OZK with more than $20 billion in assets selected Dovetail in the quarter. We expect to see more institutions take steps to enrich and extend their payments capabilities to meet the evolving needs of a digitally-centric landscape.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continue to see strong demand around Zelle. As you have likely seen reported, Zelle transactions now exceed $400 million and grew 75% year-over-year.","We expect broad industry adoption to accelerate over the next 24 months as evidenced by the nearly 100 new clients we signed for Zelle in the fourth quarter alone which is more than the total signings in the first three quarters in the year.","As the leading provider of Zelle services to all-sized financial institutions, we have opportunities to package our payments value proposition in unique and interesting ways. For example in the quarter MUFG Union Bank with $124 billion in assets selected both our turnkey Zelle Solution to be implemented later this year along with the Dovetail Payments Platform to help enable real-time enterprise payment capabilities for their customers.","Overall we believe our leadership as the most experienced standalone as well as integrated Zelle provider will enable us to deliver payments innovation and client value to the financial industry.","Lastly PennyMac a top mortgage lender selected a broad suite of products including debit processing, electronic billing and a unique mobile wallet to meet their customers' expectations.","With that let me turn the call over to Bob for more detail on our financial results.","Bob Hau","Thank you Jeff and good afternoon everyone. As you've heard, we are pleased with our strong 2018 performance. Adjusted revenue was up 2% in both the quarter and the year to $1.5 billion and $5.5 billion respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4.5% in the fourth quarter and full year, driven by solid performance in both segments. The fourth quarter results were even stronger when considering last year's comparative performance of 6% internal revenue growth.","Adjusted operating income, which was impacted by the Lending Transaction, was in line with the prior year at $492 million for the quarter and up 1%, to $1.8 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 33.4%, which is a decrease of 60 basis points compared to last year's record results.","As we've shared all year, our adjusted operating margin performance includes structural headwinds from the Lending Transaction, along with investments funded from tax savings. These two items had a negative margin impact of 160 and 110 basis points in the quarter and year respectively.","Adjusted EPS was up 24% at $0.84 in the quarter and increased 25% to $3.10 for the year, marking our 33rd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Payments segment has had strong performance all the year in digital, again, this quarter. Adjusted revenue was 9%, to $865 million in the quarter and up 8%, to $3.2 billion for the year, which includes two months of impact from the acquisition of the Elan debit processing business.","Integration with our card services business is in flight and progressing well. Internal revenue growth in the segment was 6% in the quarter and 5% for the year, led by strong performance in card services, biller solutions and electronic payments, partially offset by lower periodic revenue. Organic debit transaction growth was high single digits in both the quarter and year.","Adjusted operating income in the segment grew 9%, to $315 million in the quarter and 8%, to $1.1 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin performance in the quarter was a very strong 36.4%, in line with last year and expanded 20 basis points to a new high watermark of 35.3% for the year. The client-focused investments, funded from tax reform, negatively impacted the Payments segment results by 120 basis points and 50 basis points for the quarter and year respectively.","An important element of expanding high-quality growth is extending our digital and payments footprint. Along those lines Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 21% in the quarter to cross 8 million. We also continued to add clients to our unified digital platform Architect, with seven implementations in the quarter and 19 for the year. In addition, we signed 26 new Architect clients in 2018, further demonstrating the market opportunity and importance of digital.","Lastly, P2P transactions from, both our Popmoney and Zelle solutions, grew a combined 74% for the quarter and 44% for the year, showcasing the strong growth potential of these important DDA-based payment technologies. Zelle volume alone in 2018 was up more than six times the prior year.","For the Financial segment, adjusted revenue was down 8% to $615 million for the quarter and down 5% to $2.4 billion for the year, both of which were significantly impacted by the Lending Transaction. Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter and 4% for the year, driven primarily by solid performance across our account and item processing businesses.","Adjusted operating income was $208 million for the quarter and $798 million for 2018, both of which declined due to the Lending Transaction.","Accordingly, adjusted operating margin contracted 140 basis points in the quarter to 33.7%. And similar to my comments on the total company results, the Financial segment adjusted operating margin was negatively impacted by the Lending transaction and tax savings reinvestment, totaling 190 basis points in the quarter.","But for these items, adjusted operating margin would have expanded 50 basis points even in light of reduced periodic revenue from the very strong fourth quarter performance last year.","For the year, adjusted operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 33.3%, which reflects a 150 basis point headwind from the combination of that Lending transaction and tax savings reinvestments.","We expect the combined impact of these items to be fairly muted on our total company adjusted operating margin results in 2019. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $31 million for the quarter and $122 million for the year. Both the quarter and full-year results were in line with our expectations.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% and 21.6% for the year, both lower than prior year due primarily to the benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We expect our tax rate for 2019 to be in the range of 22% to 23%.","We generated record free cash flow, exceeding $1.3 billion this year highlighting a hallmark of our business model significant free cash flow generation. Free cash flow was up 7% for the year, which includes a reduction due to the Lending transaction.","Free cash flow conversion was 146% in the quarter and 102% for the year. Conversion was slightly below our initial expectations, primarily due to higher working capital and increased CapEx, which we expect to moderate in 2019.","We repurchased nearly nine million shares in the quarter for $689 million and over 25 million shares in 2018, returning a record $1.9 billion to shareholders. Since inception of our share repurchase program, we retired nearly 482 million shares for $11.4 billion or more than 60% of the shares outstanding at the start.","And as of December 31st, we had 393 million shares outstanding and 26 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization. And as you know in conjunction with the First Data announcement, we have deferred any additional share repurchase until the transaction closes. Total debt outstanding at the end of the year was $6 billion, bringing our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2.6 times.","With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks, Bob. Sales in the quarter was up 31% to an all time high, which is even more noteworthy when compared to the record level on last year's fourth quarter and was 114% of quota.","Sales for the year was up 5% and we attained 91% of quota. Integrated sales was also very strong in the quarter, up nearly 30% over the prior year, and 131% sequentially. Importantly, we exited the year with a domestic pipeline that even after our record sales remains nearly 20% higher than at the same point last year.","We are pleased with our sales results and market momentum. We made excellent progress on our operational effectiveness initiatives during the year. We achieved another $12 million of savings in the quarter and $57 million for the year against our $50 million target.","As of the end of the year three, we have already booked $200 million of the expected $250 million five year program. In the aggregate, we have captured nearly $800 million of saves over the last dozen years. For 2019, we expect to achieve $50 million which would close out our $250 million five-year program one full year early.","Before we get to guidance let me provide some perspective on the environment. We continue to see the market moving to places where we are focused such as payments and risk, all things digital, and delivering a world-class core account processing ecosystem. We believe this evolving paradigm will require market participants to increase their investments in technology, focus on data insights, and reengineer their customer journeys.","Given these trends, coupled with the current macroeconomic environment we believe M&A will continue to be active an example of which we saw earlier today. We firmly believe financial institutions will increase their technology investment and where possible spread that across larger scale, extend their deposit gathering capabilities and create differentiation in how they go to market. On balance these trends are very consistent with our strategic hypotheses and reinforces the actions we have taken to position your company for long-term success.","Now looking ahead to 2019, we expect our internal revenue growth rate to step up and be in a range of 4.5% to 5%. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.39 to $3.52, representing growth of 10% or 14% which is measured against the revised 2018 result of $3.08, which reflects the remaining impact of the Lending Transaction.","We expect our adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points and we anticipate our free cash flow conversion to be more than 105% for the full year. For modeling purposes, we anticipate that our financial performance will accelerate into the second half of the year creating additional momentum as we go into 2020.","Importantly, our guidance does not include or anticipate any impact from the First Data transaction, which we expect to close later this year. In conclusion, we're pleased with our financial operational and strategic results for the year. We further strengthened the business and are excited and optimistic about the future of your company.","We were recently named by FORTUNE Magazine as a World's Most Admired Company for the sixth year in a row and received high marks for long-term investment value financial soundness people management and social responsibility. This important recognition underscores our commitment to excellence and innovation as a global leader in FinTech.","As we look to 2019, we remain committed to delivering high-quality results including, an increase in internal revenue growth strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation.","Lastly, let me recognize and thank the 24,000 Fiserv associates around the world who are committed to delivering excellence for clients and shareholders each and every day. I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far and even more optimistic about our collective future.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-answer-session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Jeff Yabuki","Darrin? Just start off.","Darrin Peller","Hey, Jeff. Can you just start off with any market feedback you're hearing from customers either on -- on either side First Data's customers or perhaps your own banks since the deal was announced. Love to hear some quick spot check on the sentiment.","Jeff Yabuki","Yes. Sure. So obviously, we spent a substantial majority of time with our clients, although, a number of clients have multiple relationships. And I have to say, the client reactions have been incredibly positive both in terms of two strong companies coming together.","As you know Darrin, Frank and his team have done a great job in rebuilding First Data and I think the fact that we're coming together people see the opportunities, those opportunities that we've talked about whether they be around bank merchant opportunities, around network enhancement and enriching, the payment the end-to-end payment opportunities and even some clients who have said \"Hey, now that you guys are together, we want you to take a look at this business that we would not have otherwise done, had you not come together.\" So the feedback's been great positive; probably more positive than we would've thought to this date -- to the date so far.","Darrin Peller","That's great to hear. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up, I mean, look, we saw your community announcement today, and, obviously, you're showing strong integrated sales again. I guess, first of all, if you can give us a little bit more color on what drove the win on New York Community. I think it was competitive process. And then on the strength on the integrated sales, I mean, if you could just maybe rank order the top three areas you're seeing differentiate yourselves right now in this quarter against last quarter that'd be great. And thanks again, guys.","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. Absolutely. Thanks, Darrin. So, the world -- as the world becomes more digitally-centric, we're clearly in an environment that is real-time. Many of the core banking systems in the U.S. are not real-time. And so there's been a lot of focus on do I take the step to real-time now or do I wait? In this case New York Community made a determination that they wanted to go with real-time.","The second thing is they wanted the flexibility of an API-based system, more modern technology. And then third, and just as important is the suite of products that we bring in everything from online and mobile to payments hub technology and including had we already been closed on the First Data, I'm sure we would've looked at this as well.","So the belief that we're going along into digital payments in real-time is the thing that helps move that end of the market in. So, from that perspective, that's all great.","On the integrated sales front, it's really around digital. So whether it be Architect or Mobiliti, a lot of movements on payments, Dovetail payment hub, Zelle, and then a fair amount of energy on just risk and fraud to make sure that as the more complex digital ecosystem comes together that they're able to protect themselves. So, a lot of focus on those areas.","Darrin Peller","Okay. That's great guys. Thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Bob Hau","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open.","Brett Huff","Good afternoon guys.","Jeff Yabuki","Hi, Brett.","Brett Huff","Can you talk a little bit more about Dovetail? It sounds like we're seeing more traction at least than I expected on that. I know it's a bit of a Swiss Army knife asset. Can you give us the main driver? Is this a payments hub future-proofing kind of thing? Or is this -- are there specific use cases that people are going after? Or is this a cost savings focus? Can you just illuminate that a little bit for us?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure Brett. I mean it's a little of all of those things. Although I do have to say, I like the Swiss Army knife metaphor because that actually fits pretty well. Where you have some trends going on as you know in the market that are having people take a look at the payments back-office infrastructure that you have.","So whether it be around TCH or other real-time use cases, the opportunity is to pair up Dovetail with Zelle and have a different way to move money. There's also a fair amount of focus going on right now around updating and enriching wire capabilities. So those use cases are making it more tangible to think about it.","The other beauty of Dovetail is, we can install the hub and toggle capabilities as, if and when clients need them. So in some cases, you've got clients who want everything; in other cases they may only want wire. But we're enabling everything and then giving them what they want when they decide they need it.","And it is -- it was consistent with our strategic thesis, when we bought Dovetail. It's taken us a little bit longer. We said throughout the year, it was part of why we were seeing some slowness in sales is, is these are longer more technical sales. But as we're seeing them ramp up, they're beginning to get some nice momentum.","And we expect that momentum to carry really for the next couple of years as all-sized institutions think differently about ACH is really the standard and moving in more to a real-time or near real-time capability.","Brett Huff","That's helpful. And a follow-up another product question. Can you talk about bill pay in a sec? You have a market-leading bill pay position and have also kind of migrated some of those things to the NOW Network. How does that fit in with the new group of merchants that you all are likely to have once this deal closes? Is there any specific ways or rails or things that we should be thinking about on how you connect the bill pay with some of those merchants?","Jeff Yabuki","Yes. I mean we're very excited about the fact that First Data has; call it order of magnitude somewhere around a 40 share in the U.S. in merchants. And that is in fact an element of a rail and so we're certainly examining is there a different way to electronify the standard consumer-to-business payments.","We're also quite excited in thinking about the combining some of the capabilities that we have in our cash management technologies along with, not just the retail piece of RXP, but also the business-to-business piece of RXP and the size of the merchant databases which are quite significant.","And then looking at really, how can we expedite payments not just in the consumer side but in the business-to-business side as well? So we see a lot of optionality there. It's one of the areas in which we believe we'll ultimately invest to help enhance the way businesses move money.","Brett Huff","Great, thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open.","Dave Koning","Yes. Hey guys, congrats on a lot of front. Yes, so I guess first of all in the FI segment, the margin decline has gotten bigger over the last three or four quarters. Is that just -- you were having a pretty good year. You were kind of flexible in terms of what you could spend on investments. I know the Lending -- that sale obviously contributed. Is that what's kind of happening? And does that allow the margins to grow at an increasing rate through 2019 in that segment?","Bob Hau","Yes. Dave, its Bob. Probably the biggest driver of the margin into the second half of the year is really the ramp of that tax savings reinvestment. We announced that launch at the very beginning of the year and by that time, we really got it ramped and running, it was really into the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And so you saw more of a significant headwind of that in the second half of the year than you did in the first half of the year. And of course, that will abate somewhat into 2018, so we hope to see a margins lift in this as part of the 50 basis point margin -- at least 50 basis point margin expansion we've forecasted for next year.","Jeff Yabuki","We also had Dave a fairly meaningful decline in periodic revenue in the quarter of which a big block of that comes in the Financial segment. So that also had a real impact in the quarter.","Bob Hau","That's a big driver for fourth quarter.","Dave Koning","Yes. Okay got you. And then, the follow-up question I guess in payments, does Elan have significant seasonality? And is it -- is there enough cost savings and margin improvement that that actually drives some of the margin expansion in payments? Or is that a little bit of a drag still in the first full year?","Jeff Yabuki","Yes. I think you should think about it as a drag in the first full year. We've obviously accounted for that in our 50 basis points of -- or at least 50 basis points of positive margin expansion this year. But it is going to drag us throughout the year. I don't see them having different seasonality than the rest of our card business, but there is going to be more card utilization in Q4 versus what we would see for example in Q1.","Dave Koning","Great. Thanks guys, congrats.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks, Dave.","Dave Koning","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jim Schneider","Excuse me.","Jeff Yabuki","Hi, Jim.","Jim Schneider","Hey. How are you? Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering and apologies if this has been answered already. If you looked more broadly at the bank landscape, what do you think today's merger announcement says about the prospects of foreseeing additional actions more downmarket in your traditional client base. And maybe just talk about what you see in the bank consolidation environment generally speaking please.","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. So we talked a little bit about this in our prepared remarks. I mean, in my opinion, this is an example of a couple of good strong banks who decided that they're going to go harder at some of the larger banks and they're going to look to consolidate to create more capacity to invest in technology. I think there's a real recognition of that importance including an announcement where they're going to increase their technology spend meaningfully. I think that is what we're seeing across the ecosystem in terms of looking for different ways to spend money on technology. There's a real need to do that, whether it be digital, retail risk, payments all of those areas many of the things that we've talked about and weaved in throughout our prepared comments.","We have been saying for a couple of years, we've been seeing a fair amount of M&A. I think that's going to continue because scale is going to matter. There's a lot of focus on deposits -- deposit gathering. And for us, the good news is even though we will continue to have the same kind of consolidation in our base that we've seen for the last 30 years. I do think that the places, in which we are going along are the places, in which the investments are occurring. And I also think that -- I think it will send a message to the industry when you're seeing companies that are both strong come together to be a better company, we think 22 days ago we made a similar announcement. But Jim I think that's what the message is in that announcement today.","Jim Schneider","That's helpful. Thanks very much. And then maybe just as a follow-up, can you maybe talk about relative to the revenue synergies you expect to see over the five years post transaction close, which are the one or two items that you think you could see soonest in terms of either the cross-sell opportunities or the network side or the card processing side or just the pure cross-sell of acquiring services? Maybe just talk through what you see coming and materializing first, second and third and the progression to the $500 million.","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. So I mean, I think as part of our original announcement we said, we expected nearly $100 million of actual revenue synergy in the first 12 months post close. And a big part of that is because, we believe by the combination of the networks and the ability for routing opportunities and different forms of network innovation that we will be able to by virtue of the combination without having to go out and sell and implement and have lead time, but just doing things in a more cohesive way. With the scale of the company's coming together that will create some incremental value there.","I think the second thing is we're going to have a good amount of success in the merchant bank space. And one of the things that we've been very pleased about is that the feedback coming from the community institutions all the way up through the largest banks there's a lot of interest in how can we take the things that we're doing today whether it be digital and core and integrate them with merchant and we will work on that and have -- be as expeditious as we can in getting that into the market.","So I think we'll actually see benefits coming from that fairly early in the process again part of the nearly 100. But I think we'll see sales ramp up a little bit faster than we originally anticipated. And then we'll have a number of different products to sell across both sets of client bases through the normal. Think about it as our integrated sales and I think that will probably be third in that order.","Jim Schneider","Thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Ramsey El-Assal","Hi, guys thanks for taking my question. I wanted to revisit the BB&T-SunTrust deal. Can you help us understand to what degree there would potentially be an impact to your P&L from that transaction? Are they both customers of yours? Or are there any risk of consolidated pricing there or losing some of the business? Or if you could just speak to that I'd appreciate it.","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. So both SunTrust and BB&T are good long-term clients of ours and we expect that that will continue. Of course, it's only been a few hours but we have no reason to believe that that will not continue.","The kinds of services that they are using from us, we think are fairly well-provided across the base and they're not generally the kinds of things that you can combine. So, bill payment would be a good example. So we think that that will continue to be -- will work well for us.","They're also clients of First Data and I assume that they will continue to be good clients of First Data. So, for right now we feel like there will be opportunities for us to do as much if not more given some of the things that we're doing and some of the investments that we believe they may make given the transaction.","Ramsey El-Assal","Got it. And my follow-up I wanted to ask about DNA and this New York Community Bank win which is impressive. This is kind of a proof-point that DNA is -- definitely appeals to a larger asset-sized institution. I mean what does the pipeline look like for larger sized deals here? Is this kind of more of an outlier? Or are you really seeing the momentum moving sort of upmarket with DNA?","Jeff Yabuki","Yes, Ramsey that's a great question. Thanks for the kind remarks. We have been -- interestingly, for the last couple of years, we have been very pleased at where -- how we have played in the kind of the larger bank RFP process. So, we have -- basically in every large deal that has been done over the last couple of years, we have been a finalist in the -- in an RFP process -- so in the competitive process.","And frankly, one of the things that's been a little bit of a challenge is it's hard to win your second one until you've won the first. And now that we have won this, we've won several banks that are in the $30 billion range. We now believe that this takes us up to the next level. And we are the only real-time modern technology platform in the U.S., that's U.S.-based and U.S.-centric and we do think this will help us.","Now, we also recognize that there are not 100 of these going a year, but there are enough of them to matter. And as you know we typically are really great in payments, in digital, in mobile, and risk and those products up in that end, but we have not had the momentum in core and we think this is a great step in the right direction.","Ramsey El-Assal","Great. Thanks so much.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos. Your line is now open.","George Mihalos","Hey guys thanks. Thanks for taking my question.","Jeff Yabuki","Sure.","George Mihalos","Just again maybe thinking about the First Data acquisition and all the assets and the services that that brings to you. Now, you obviously have the merchant capability, you're more robust on the issuer processing side. You also get sort of a stronger switch. Is there an opportunity as you think of sort of recreating a network to sort of put something in place kind of similar to what a very large bank like Chase has done with sort of a ChaseNet type product. Is that something that's on the road map for you guys?","Jeff Yabuki","I would say at this stage we are in the process of evaluating a number of different opportunities. Certainly, looking at all of the different ways in which we can create network value for our issuer clients and our merchant clients is quite high on the list.","Frankly, our focus at this stage has been more around where are the opportunities to innovate in the progression of the merchant capability and where are the ways to integrate in the progression of the issuer-merchant connectivity.","And so we see some really intriguing opportunities there around digital enablement, around real-time connectivity between what's happening at the point of transaction, all the way back through cash management and back into the core account processing system.","Frankly, we believe that one of the things that makes us unique is, not just that we have the issuer and the merchant piece, but we have the core engine as well, wrapped up by the back-office payments. And so, we see a lot of opportunity there, especially as the world moves more to real-time. So a little bit of a long-winded answer, but we're still early in the process of evaluating those kinds of opportunities.","George Mihalos","Great, appreciate that. That's very helpful. Then maybe just a quick follow up sort of a housekeeping item. How should we be thinking about the term fees in 2019 versus 2018? And maybe if we look at the 50 bps of margin expansion, kind of, thinking about that between the Financial and Payments segment. Thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. Thank you.","Bob Hau","Yes. For 2018, it was down a bit. I would expect 2019 in total, from a periodic revenue standpoint, to be up modestly, call it, flat relative to what we saw in 2018 actual.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.","Chris Shutler","Hi, guys. Good afternoon.","Jeff Yabuki","Hi, Chris.","Bob Hau","Hey, Chris.","Chris Shutler","Jeff, could you give us a sense when you look at your FI customers, how many have merchant bank capabilities today? And how many you view as kind of viable candidates for merchant acquiring?","Jeff Yabuki","It's a really interesting question. And it's only interesting, because there's really no bank or -- and many credit unions, who don't have connectivity to merchant. What we have found in the community space is an incredible amount of fragmentation, very few institutions have kind of an all -- going all in with a single source. It's much more around letting the merchants to some extent make those decisions, because people like us haven't built out the technological advantages around integration that we believe we're going to be able to build.","So we think it's very much a greenfield space. And the key is going to be, how will you begin to prioritize the combination of front book and back book and how the institutions are focusing on their end market. And again, the second piece is, how do you make it easy through integration into the core system for banks to be in a place where they can better serve their merchants and create some economic value for them at the same time. And we think there's a reasonable amount of value for banks to capture. And we like being in the point where our technology is actually making money for banks as opposed to costing them money.","Chris Shutler","Great. And then, just one clean up. The 2019 guidance for EPS. Can you just confirm that whether there are any share repurchases in that guidance?","Bob Hau","We have, essentially, in our overall guidance 10% at 12% growth off of the 2018 actual result incorporated the deferment of our share repurchase through at least close. And that range essentially encompasses a variety of potential outcomes there.","Jeff Yabuki","Okay, Chris. And I think I would clarify by saying Bob really meant to say 10% to 14% of EPS guidance. I think what -- I mean, what -- we obviously are not buying back shares at this point and we have to get to close. I think what we would say is our 10% to 14% assumes whatever the different scenarios are that we believe will happen throughout the year.","George Mihalos","Right. Thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open.","Glenn Greene","Thanks. Good afternoon, Jeff and Bob.","Jeff Yabuki","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Greene","I wanted to go back to sort of the booking and sales environment. The 30%-plus number in the fourth quarter was obviously great. But I'm curious how broad-based it was. Or was it skewed by New York Community Bank? How much? And obviously, you've got the pipeline up 20%. So it certainly feels like the environment's really good. And just sort of a secondary question on that is New York Community Bank's scheduled to convert at all in 2019? Or is that more of a 2020? I'm trying to understand if that impacts the organic growth in 2019.","Jeff Yabuki","Yes. So I would say Glenn that the sales for the quarter were incredibly broad-based. A lot of activity across virtually every line. And many, many of the sales were on an outsourced ASP kind of cloud environment, right? So, a lot of future recurring revenue that's going to get booked.","The part of it is -- the second and third quarters were not great and so we had some pickup in the fourth quarter for that. But the fact that we had such a big quarter ended up for the year year-over-year even though a little short of quota and the pipe is still up nearly 20%. We like you view that as being quite positive. And we like what's in the pipeline the kinds of transactions that are in the pipeline.","As far as New York Community goes, there will be a bit of positive impact in 2019, but the substantial majority or the big boost will come in 2020 and beyond.","Glenn Greene","Okay. And then just quickly I don't know if you have any more thoughts, it's only been three weeks since you announced the merger. But the $900 million of cost synergies, I'm just getting a sense -- trying to get a sense if there's any other sort of low-hanging fruit you found. And would you be willing to share a little bit sort of thinking of the timing of how quickly you might have realized that.","Jeff Yabuki","Yes. So I would say that as we referenced in our prepared remarks that we're highly confident in both the $900 million of cost synergies and the $500 million of incremental revenue synergies over the period. I think when we made our -- when we talked about this we talked about the fact that it's a little bit of a barbell.","We expect to get a lot of benefit in the first couple of years. We're talking about a net 20% accretion, which obviously also takes into account the interest saves, which are not part of the $900 million. Then you start to get to some things that are a little bit tougher. You do work and you have it come back in.","I would say at this stage, we've gotten the integration kicked off. We're taking a look at things. Depending on if you're asking Frank or me, we're more bullish on the timing. Bob and his counterparts are a little bit -- they're going to try to give us the Heisman on that a little bit. But we feel very good about the $900 million. We feel good about the timing that we've talked about. And you can be sure that just like what we do in our operational effectiveness work, we're going to do everything we can to bring that in early.","And we'd like nothing better, although this is not guidance, but we'd like nothing better than to get done earlier than we anticipated so we could get to the Phase two, and three, and four, and five, and six and everything else to build upon the muscle that we built in Fiserv for the last 12 years.","Glenn Greene","Great. Thank you very much, Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Brendler of the Buckingham Research Group. Your line is now open.","Chris Brendler","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One quick question on the merger, I look at the cash flow projections of the pro forma company it looks pretty powerful. And your leverage guidance I'm getting a pretty significant variance on -- as pay that down. Can you talk about potentially the merger and sort of integration cost and how significant those might be in your plans? Thanks.","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. Thanks. And Chris it's good to chat with you. So I would say that our plans around generating the free cash and the -- call it $4 billion-ish over the next few years I mean we're certainly feeling quite good about that. I think on balance, we've said that we expect the -- and Bob correct me if I'm wrong we basically expect the one-time cost to be somewhere in the area of the $900 million of synergies.","And so I think that's the general rule of thumb that we're using. And that will probably go a little bit ahead of the synergies because you typically are spending the money as you book them and not -- or as you lock them down and not necessarily as they come into the P&L. But I don't think they'll be gigantic in the flow of that.","And then as it relates to the leverage ratios, remember that what we've talked about is that we're going to suspend -- or sorry defer share repurchase between now and closing and then we'll reevaluate what we have going on.","We think the combination of the growth and EBITDA and the payback potential out of the significant free cash flow that we'll generate will allow us to pretty quickly get back to our more normal capital allocation strategy which typically includes buying back shares.","So we think that there will be a combination of tracks paying down debt, repurchasing shares and probably doing little solution oriented acquisitions again at some point with the first two taking precedence. Bob does that...","Bob Hau","Yes exactly right.","Chris Brendler","That makes a ton of sense. Thanks Jeff. And if I could ask a follow-up on -- you mentioned on the merger call the opportunity for the Clover potentially within the Fiserv client base and just sort of fascinated about that possibility.","Can you just give me sort of how you view Clover both as part of the merchant business and the potential to bring that into banks today and offer them a Square-like solution. And also what's your thinking in terms of the core business -- the core processing business and how they could use Clover? Thanks.","Jeff Yabuki","Yes. Sure. So I mean -- we're really very bullish about the ability to bring Clover into the community banking system for a couple of reasons. First of all, we like the fact that we can drive, we think a really powerful end-to-end integration advantage. We can digitally enable that to make it easier for merchants to be able to select on their own that technology if they decide to open an account online. We envision being able to also sign up as a Clover merchant in that same process, so digitally enabling that element of the value chain.","And then most importantly, it's a really attractive technology. It will be in a place where we can combat -- banks can combat Square if they so choose. And then lastly and probably most importantly is we believe that by integrating this into the core account processing systems that we'll be able to create a data advantage for the banks vis-\u00e0-vis what they could have done otherwise and allow them to better serve their SMBs and also to optimize their revenue, which we see happening in some of the larger institutions. So we're really excited about that and our banks are as well.","Chris Brendler","Great. Thanks, Jeff. Really appreciate it and just can't wait to see how that come together.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Jeff Cantwell","Hi, good afternoon.","Jeff Yabuki","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Cantwell","Thanks for squeezing me in. Can I just circle back on something? You just touched on this. I guess, a little context for you here. We cover Community Bank. That's a client of yours and they're excited to see what you did with Clover, right? So I guess the crux of the question, should we expect Clover as a potential offering by your bank partners using online? Because we know that from First Data's standpoint, digital distribution was a big initiative of theirs with their larger JV partners. I guess, what I'm trying to drive at is, is offering Clover at all of those financial institution websites, a realistic outcome from all this even if it may not be near-term focus? Can you just give us your thoughts there?","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah. And Jeff thanks for asking the question. I mean, we realize as well as you do that one of the issues has been a lack of digitally enabling the selection of Clover or other merchant capability. And First Data has done a great job of building out the -- basically the procurement capability, but have not been able to enable the whole process.","One of the beauties of what we bring to the party is not only do we have the core system but in many, many cases we are also the digital enabler, hosting websites, doing lots of those kinds of things. We're serving somewhere in the area of 110 million digital users today in the U.S. We have 140 million accounts that we're processing for.","And so when you bring that together we do see opportunity. Now to your point, we think it will take some time to figure out the right way to do that. But that's pretty high on our list just given the opportunity that we see and the opportunity that the clients see as well.","Jeff Cantwell","Thanks very much.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had -- I should ask like a multipart one right? It's been a long day for me too. Yeah, so on the -- everyone's asked about the cost synergies. I wonder just two parts and I'll ask them upfront. First, on the $500 million of revenue synergies, can you break that down for us? Is that cross-selling versus new products versus other products? And then the second part of that question, which I'll just ask upfront. Traditionally, having covered FTC and having covered Fiserv and the core processors, you're selling into different parts of the bank with different decisions and different people. And I'm wondering, as you start to see this come together, how do you bridge that gap with a core processing system necessarily \u2013 or someone who uses a different core processing system necessarily convert because you've got merchant acquiring? Or is it all from the outside-in as you talk about with Square et cetera? Thanks.","Jeff Yabuki","Yeah. Absolutely. So, let me take the first part of that first. So, when we announced the deal we talked about three distinct buckets of value. We talked about a couple of hundred million dollars of revenue synergies, so 40% of the $500 million would really be around merchant bank, merchant bank acquiring services. The second bucket was around really payments, network innovation, expanding our payments offerings and network innovation that was around $250 million.","And then, the last $50 million was around integrated sales just generally cross-selling across all of the things that both of the companies do and that's really around the world. And again we provided numbers that we were highly confident that we would be able to achieve. I would also put in one other caveat. We also talked about the fact that, we made a $500 million incremental investment into technology, into supporting the technologies and that is separate from the $500 million.","So the benefits of that $500 million aren't accounted for in that \u2013 in the $500 million of revenue synergies. So we continue to feel good about that aspect of it. As it relates to the second part of your question really around \u2013 to your point about the core processors and payments. In the largest banks, clearly, that's going on separately. You've got the back-office payments people looking at payment hubs. And you've got front office payments looking at cards. And you've got core looking \u2013 no one in the largest banks have really for the most part looking at core, but certainly that would go into a different place.","In the core even in the New York Community Bank level that size institutions doesn't have the fragmentation that you're talking about and these things are looked to be bought together. And because we have such strong relationships whether they be digitally-based or payments-based or core-based in the call it everything, but the top 10 banks they're less fragmented than having to literally go to a bunch of different people.","Once you -- and maybe it's 15. But for the most part, the relationships that we have and First Data have are going to be extensible and not going to be as murky as it will seem on the surface to go in and be able to talk through the value. In fact, many, many, many, many clients are wanting to do that already. Of course, we have to wait until we close to be able to go out and do that. But the conversations and the enthusiasm is certainly out there right now.

Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased with our strong financial results in the quarter and are on track to meet our objectives for the year. We delivered internal revenue growth of 4% against what was by far our most difficult revenue comparison of the year. These results include a 1 percentage point drag on revenue from a combination of currency and lower termination fees in the quarter.","Our continuing focus on high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency drove an increase in adjusted operating income of 8% and a 150 basis point expansion in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted earnings per share was up 9%, despite an 8 percentage point negative tax rate impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter. Free cash flow per share was up an impressive 22% in the quarter. Sales were 83% of quota in the quarter and slightly below last year's record Q1 results. We remain confident about our sales and revenue prospects for the remainder of the year.","For the second straight year, we were recognized as one of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. In April, we were also named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine. In both cases, we were the only one of our core competitors to be recognized, which we believe is a reflection of our cultural focus on delivering superior value for our clients, associates and shareholders.","We identified three key enterprise priorities for 2015 in our last call, which we will update you on each quarter. The priorities are first, continue to build high quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments. Second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. And third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.","As I mentioned, internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter compared to 6% in last year's Q1, lead by strong performance in a number of our recurring revenue businesses. Growth was strong across several areas in the quarter such as card services, digital solutions including mobility ASP and account processing.","We continue to focus on building high-quality recurring revenue, which should lead to an increase in our internal revenue growth rate again this year. This targeted growth profile also helps fuel our objective to sustainably grow operating margin, which for this year is targeted to expand by at least 50 basis points. In the quarter, adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points. Free cash flow per share was up a very strong 22% in the quarter, reflecting the results of our attractive business model combined with the benefit of consistent disciplined capital allocation. Overall, we are on track to deliver on each of our financial commitments for the year.","Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships, and we did just that in the quarter. We recently announced that Vibrant Credit Union, with assets in excess of $500 million, selected the DNA account processing platform, along with a number of Fiserv integrated solutions to help them deliver a unique experience to each of their 41,000 members. Four new DNA clients went live in the quarter. We expect to more than double the number of new DNA institutions that go live this year as compared to 2014.","Our core account processing growth opportunities extend well beyond DNA as our account processing offerings meet the needs of a diverse end market. During the quarter, a top 40 bank selected our signature account processing platform along with a full suite of our market leading products, such as item processing, electronic bill payment, Popmoney, debit processing and the Accel network. We are excited about the opportunity to provide this new client a uniquely differentiated experience when they go live next year.","Digital solutions and mobile in particular continue to be a high priority for the market. We added to our Mobiliti consumer business, signing 36 new clients in the quarter. Late last year, we began implementing programs to help our clients drive higher levels of mobile adoption, which contributed to even stronger growth in Mobiliti ASP subscribers in Q1.","Mobile usage also tends to enable a variety of value-added opportunities such as real-time payments and deposits, Mobile Capture and Snap-to-Pay. As you may recall our Mobiliti Business solution went live in the fourth quarter of last year. Through the end of Q1, we've already signed 8% of the business banking client base to this important new solution. Although only a handful of clients are currently live, we expect this strategic product to drive value for some of our clients' most profitable customers and an attractive recurring revenue stream for us.","We just wrapped our spring Forum client event, where we hosted nearly 4,000 people representing a broad range of financial institutions, billers, lenders and other purveyors of financial products. At Forum, we provided updates on our market leading solutions and latest innovations from across the company.","Our Solutions Center was highly trafficked, with more than 2,000 unique visits to different product areas including the NOW Network, digital solutions, real-time payments, lending, billing, EMV and investment services. We are pleased with the early returns from Forum and look forward to our next event, coming in the fall.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. While we expect to cover several of these opportunities in depth at our Investor Day, some highlights for the quarter include a new unique agreement with Morgan Stanley to jointly provide a global turnkey asset management platform for financial institutions outside the U.S. Our market-leading managed account technology solution, which now supports multi-currency, portfolio accounting, model management and trading will be combined with the breadth and expertise of Morgan Stanley to create differentiated value and an attractive source of brand new growth. We're excited about this opportunity and expect to go live in early 2016.","We're gaining traction embedding our real-time payment capabilities into CheckFree RXP and Popmoney. Real-time transactions were up 54% in the quarter, which has the dual benefit of meeting a critical customer need while delivering high quality fee revenue for our clients. We also advanced our new real-time deposit capability in the quarter. This newer use case allows consumers faster guaranteed access to their phones and drives fee revenue for our clients. These real-time opportunities, which are generally enabled by the NOW Network, are a strong link to changing consumer expectations.","Interest for Agiliti, our UK cloud-based account processing solution, expanded once again in the quarter. The far-reaching demand has moved from being core based to include several key add-on solutions such as card processing, digital capabilities and risk. We continue to build out our integrated platform and expect to go live later this year.","Last, we continue our focus on EMV. The number and level of client conversations remains elevated, and we've increased our capacity to deliver against the anticipated market demand. And while debit EMV card issuance continues to lag credit, we expect to see a ramp in the second half of the year and expect that to continue over the next several years.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon everyone. Internal revenue growth was 4% and adjusted revenue was up to $1.2 billion in the quarter against our toughest compare of the year. This performance was even stronger below the surface given the negative currency impact along with lower termination fees, which together pushed our growth rate down by 1 percentage point.","Growth in our card processing, digital channels including Mobiliti, account processing and risk solutions led our performance in the quarter. This high quality revenue growth and a continued focus on operational efficiency drove an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $371 million and an impressive 150 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin.","Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89, increasing 9% over last year. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was negatively impacted by about $0.07 or 8 percentage points of growth from this year's much higher comparable tax rate due to significant discrete tax benefits in last year's first quarter.","Moving on to the segment results, our Payments segment adjusted revenue, all internal, was up 4% to $613 million compared to one of our strongest growth quarters in the past several years. Growth was led by our card processing and digital channels businesses, and was partially offset by the anniversary impact of some larger bill payment client implementations and biller headwinds. We believe the Payments segment revenue growth in the quarter will be the low watermark of the year, as biller headwinds ease at the end of the second quarter, ongoing conversion of the Mobiliti backlog, output solutions revenue acceleration and the early revenue benefit of EMV. For reference, we continue to expect that the majority of the EMV related revenue will bias to later in the year.","Debit transaction growth was a very strong 12% in the quarter driven by the dual benefit of growing card usage and strong sales. Mobiliti growth was excellent as backlog grew and ASP subscribers increased 65% year-over-year to more than $3.2 million. Bill payment transaction growth remained in the low single-digits and P2P transactions grew 30% in the quarter. Our focus on delivering value-added services in these solutions closely aligns with the industry's focus on faster payments. Real-time transactions were up more than 50% in the quarter.","Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 6% to $191 million and operating margin expanded 60 basis points. This solid performance includes the offsetting negative impact of additional investments in several areas including biller solutions and expanding our EMV capabilities.","Adjusted revenue in the financial segment was up 3% to $594 million. Performance was solid in our recurring revenue businesses including account processing and lending, notwithstanding the more than 1% negative revenue growth impact from currency and lower termination fees. Adjusted operating income in the financial segment was up 10% to $204 million. This very strong performance translated to a 220 basis points increase in segment adjusted operating margin for the quarter. These results were driven by high-quality revenue growth in our account processing businesses, and the positive impact from our operational efficiency programs.","The Corporate segment generated an operating loss of $24 million, which is in line with last year's results.","Our effective adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 35%, up sharply compared to the prior year, but in line with our full-year expectations. Last year's tax rate of 30% benefited from significant discrete tax benefits.","Free cash flow per share is one of our most important performance metrics. Free cash flow in the quarter was up significantly to $268 million, and up an even stronger 22% on a per-share basis to $1.10. Strong operating earnings growth and working capital improvements drove the excellent quarterly results.","Total debt at quarter end was $3.9 billion or 2.2 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio. We allocated $290 million to share repurchase in the quarter, buying 3.8 million shares at an average cost of $75 per share. There were 16 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase at quarter's end.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom. Sales for the quarter were solid at 83% of quota. These results were slightly off last year's exceptional Q1 results, but generally consistent with expectations coming off our very strong Q4 finish. We had several high profile wins in the quarter, which demonstrate the power of both our integrated value proposition and the innovation that we are supplying to the dynamic market.","For the full year, we expect actual sales value to be up roughly 10% compared to last year's record level. Integrated sales were $44 million or 18% of our full-year goal. During the quarter, we also passed through the $900 million mark for cumulative integrated sales in the second phase of our program, which we launched in 2010. We expect to surpass our five-year program goal of $950 million of total integrated sales in the second quarter.","We're on track with our operational effectiveness goals, achieving $13 million in the quarter and are making good progress against our infrastructure consolidation this year. For example, we expect to complete our Alpharetta building project and consolidate a number of our Atlanta-based facilities and over 2,000 associates in the fourth quarter of this year. Not only do we expect increased associate engagement and enhanced client interaction, we also expect to see meaningful operational effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond.","There were only five regulatory actions in the quarter, which was consistent with last year's level. While at Forum, we had the opportunity to hear directly from our clients about their priorities and technology focus. Tone continues to moderately improve and strategic conversations tend to center on building revenue, delivering digital capabilities, faster payments and a focus on differentiated customer experiences.","Overall, we are on track to achieve our objectives for the year. We continue to expect internal revenue growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.73 to $3.83, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year. We also expect internal revenue growth to further accelerate in the second half of the year as more of our sales and related revenue come online. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to expand at least 50 basis points, and importantly that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year.","In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We're on track to meet our financial and strategic commitments, which include recording an increase in the rate of internal revenue growth for the third consecutive year. These results, and the third party recognition I mentioned upfront, are a strong testament to the focus and dedication of our more than 21,000 associates who drive value for our clients each and every day.","With that, Mary, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. You may return to the queue for additional questions. Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Good margins here, I wanted to ask on that first. Just the 150 bp expansion despite the lower term fees, anything unusual this quarter and did you consider raising your margin outlook for the year given the big start in Q1?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes. I'll take that and Jeff will add to that. I think there really wasn't anything unusual in there. It's again the layering on to that high quality recurring revenue that we really have in both segments and it's been a big focus of our company as you know over the last several years, as we've kind of accelerated our internal revenue growth rate and we plan doing that again this year. So again, high quality recurring revenue, continuing to focus on our operational efficiencies and those are the primary drivers. And at this time, we're not going to be changing our guidance.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I would say, Tien-Tsin that it's early in the year. I mean, we expect to continue to perform well throughout the year. And we'll obviously take a better look at that when we get through at least the first half. Just to accentuate a point that Tom made, for several years as you will recall, we talked about making investments in some of our new products, solutions such as Mobiliti ASP, which we had to spend a lot of capital, both human and financial, upfront build the solution, sell it, distribute it, continue to add feature and function. And now we're getting to a point where we have scale and as that scale, as we continue to add users, we continue to get a nice drop through benefits in that. So it's solutions like that that are really adding to our margin, because of that focus on this high-quality recurring revenue.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. So high incremental margins. Got it. Just as my follow-up and I guess just on the EMV front, I know you said that could pursue to the higher end for the year on the revenue side. Just curious, at what point would you start to have enough order flow for you to sort of make that call that it's coming through? I'm guessing we won't see a lot of change over close to the holidays. So just trying to understand the timing of when that might be visible to you. Thank you.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes, sure. Thanks. And I mean I would say that we always knew that the EMV revenue would bias to late in the year. We've just as I mentioned had our client conference, we had lots and lots of discussion around EMV. We've got a lot of demand that is building in the pipeline. And frankly, we won't know enough until at least into the third quarter on, where we'll end up biasing for the year. I would say right now, we would be slightly below where we would have expected to be or where we potentially anticipate it to be, and it's only because of the timing of institutions. On the other side of the coin, I would say we're increasingly optimistic about the size of the opportunity and we'll certainly talk more about that at Investor Day.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut, of Evercore ISI.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good afternoon, Jeff and Tom.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, David.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Good morning, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Could you update us specifically on sales performance in the quarter of DNA? Anything to call out in terms of new bookings and competitive trends?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes, I would say we had definitely had some wins in the quarter. We had a very strong fourth quarter. Last year, we had a couple of transaction that slid from Q4 to Q1, which made Q1 quite strong last year. We continue to be extremely happy with the performance of DNA. We expect to more than double the number of go-lives we have this year. We mentioned the Vibrant Credit Union win. It was a very nice win against one of our more entrenched competitors. And so we continue to have a lot of interest in the solution on the larger credit union side as well as on the large bank side. As more and more of the bank and larger banking institutions are looking at real-time as an option and given that DNA is the only real modern technology platform that is U.S.-based, interest is quite high.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I'd just add to that that the pipelines that we have right now have never been stronger for that, both on the credit union and the banking side. So we're very pleased with that.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Great. And just as a follow-up, I noticed that you didn't provide a metrics page in the handout, Tom, although you did, I think Jeff went through a couple of metrics. Perhaps you could give the operational effectiveness versus target. And then if you could provide the breakout of term fees both for the first quarter of this year and then the year ago number. And just to slip in one more, just the quarter-end share count.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes, obviously all the metrics, we put all the metrics inside our script, David. So they are all in there. We just have a number of different metrics that will change over time depending on relevance and SIL (24:17), but all those metrics are in there. We have $13 million of operational effectiveness benefits in the quarter. So another strong quarter of execution. And so, that was very positive. Regarding the share count, as of April 30, that is 236.8 million. As of March 30, it was 237.7 million, regarding that. And regarding term fees, they're down approximately $5 million from where we were last year. So that was roughly a 50 basis point hit to our growth rate.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Anything to call out in terms of term fee comparisons for 2Q to 4Q?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","We did have as you know last year when we look back at last year, I think our first quarter of last year that was our lowest quarter of the year until we were down here in the first quarter compared to last year and then it kind of accelerated through the year. They were pretty consistent. So when you look at 2014 and we continue to manage that within our overall guidance, and but overall in the first quarter they were down. And again, last year in the first quarter was our lowest level.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And David, the operational effectiveness goal for the full year is $50 million.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Relative to the 30 DNA wins you're expecting to capture this year, I think you mentioned four came in in Q1. Was that in line with what you had expected? Or did any deals slip out into the following quarters? And can you maybe just update us on the profile of those on-boardings you expect. Is it more back-end loaded than front half? Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Jim. So just for clarity, we had four new DNA clients go live in the first quarter. We expect that to be 30 or so for the full year. That'll bias into the second half of the year. And some of our very large implementations will go live in the second half of the year. We're on track where we would expect it to be on those implementations.","I'm going to separate that from sales for a minute. The sales momentum is quite strong. As Tom mentioned, the pipeline is at its fullest level ever. And we are seeing a lot more interest from larger institutions, frankly those institutions that would not be having the conversations with us but for the fact that we have this modern technology platform. Again, when we acquired Open Solutions, we anticipated a number of benefits. Frankly, we had not anticipated the fact that the world would change so dramatically since January of 2013, that real-time would become so critical along with the processing and data capability of that platform. So we're involved in a number of larger transactions.","Now the negative to the extent there is one, is those larger transactions tend to have long sales cycles, but we're excited to be in there. And frankly another of the benefits is, as you know we have a lot of very strong relationships with large financial institutions that tend to be based in our payments technologies and\/or our channels technologies, our risk technologies, and this is now giving us an opportunity to be able to go in and have more wholesome conversations centered on the core processing solution of DNA.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, one of your primary competitors this quarter cited some significant or increasing pricing pressure in debit processing. I was wondering if first of all that's something that you see in the market, and second if so, if it's big enough to impact your results as we enter the year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we announced in the quarter that we have 12% debit growth. Obviously that's coming from a combination of what I would call a kind of a lag utilization rate in the market. And then but the other real factor is, we have a significant sales engine. And the majority of our sales really come from selling into our existing client base. So we've got a number of over 5,000 account processing clients. We've developed differentiation that's centered in integration, whether it's into the core or into our mobile services, risk services et cetera. So that's a very different value proposition.","Now we're also competing against some of the larger players that are not connected to our core. But the reality is that the majority of our success has historically come from the integration value that we can create in core. And that's a different sale, it's a different transaction, certainly we have to price into the market. But frankly, because we can deliver value that no other provider can deliver, we're able to create a better arrangement overall.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey Ramsey.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Jeff, I wanted to clarify something that you said on DNA. Are you expecting the kind of cadence of your implementations to flow more into the back half of the year or is it more sort of a steady stream and you're just expecting a couple of large ones in the second half?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, we are expecting in the range of 30 for the full year. We had four in the first quarter, and they will continue to ramp. The beauty of an account processing client is it's recurring revenue and it lasts typically for a long period of time. The downside is, is implementation cycles are anywhere from 12 to 24 months. So if you think back to the successes that we've had in winning these clients, as they go, that just takes time to go live. So I do see it being biased to later in the year both in terms of absolute numbers as well as in terms of some of the sizing of the transactions, primarily because of when we won the clients. And we think that will continue into the following year, so we're going to continue to have success in that arena.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Okay. This is sort of a longer view. The question is asking for your longer view on sort of margin expansion over the next 24 or 36 months. I mean obviously there is some great intrinsic operating leverage in the business. Are there any product categories or areas of cost take-out that you think will be a particularly sort of consistently additive source of margin expansion over time?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well I mean, when you think about the margin expansion as you said, it really comes from two primary arenas. It comes from scaling, either scaling new product investments or being additive to existing solutions that are already scaled. So that's one category. Within that category, we're always looking for, how can we be more efficient, part to be able to expand margin. But it frankly. part of that is to ensure that we're able to continue and to invest in our products in a meaningful way.","The other big piece of margin expansion frankly is on the operational effectiveness that we have been executing really fairly well since 2007. Most of that work has not touched our infrastructure today. We've had small numbers of data centers to be consolidated. We've done a location here or there. We're now focused on making sure that we are able to leverage the company that we built for the last three to five, seven years. And Tom and I both talked about the fact that we're doing these infrastructure consolidations. So we're doing more on the data center front. We're doing more in looking for ways to bring people together to create better communities of effort and around our clients.","And then lastly, we're also continuing to focus on what are the right ways for us to get the best leverage across our labor bases. We're pretty spread out. We still have lots of opportunities to create value there.","So those are the three areas that we're really focused on right now from an operational effectiveness. Combined with the scale, that really gives us a high degree of confidence that we're going to be able to continue to expand margin consistent with our long-term guidance into the foreseeable future. Lastly, I would say that you will see us spend a fair amount of energy on this at Investor Day to be able to provide confidence for the next several years that that will continue, not just for us, but also for you, our owners.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Great. That's really helpful. Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Listen, just want to quickly follow up on the margin first. I mean obviously, I think it's a follow-up to Tien-Tsin question earlier. 150 basis points in the quarter was clearly more than we had anticipated. We did anticipate some expansion, but still. When I look at the G&A number, Tom, over the past, I don't think I have seen it that low over the past five quarters. I mean is there anything, and I think you said there was nothing unusual. So I guess the bigger question is, is that new G&A number sort of sustainable at that run rate or maybe on a percentage of revenue basis you can look at it that way? And then I just have a follow-up on the drivers on mobile for a moment.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes I think, and Darrin you may be looking at kind of the GAAP number and sometimes that GAAP number includes higher levels of severance like we had in the previous quarter last year. Still when we look at our SG&A rate today, we do believe that is sustainable. Clearly it's going to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We don't manage it that way, but we continue to believe we're at a good place there and will continue to leverage in our operating model.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. I guess just more broadly, Tom, I mean G&A overall, just your cost structure, it sounds like there is nothing unusual in that number, in the overall expenses number.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","No, absolutely not.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So that percentage of revenue margin-wise sounds like that's a good number.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes. Absolutely.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's great to hear. All right, thanks. And then just, listen, on the mobile side again the growth rate has been outstanding. And I guess we just want to understand in terms of business mix, I know you guys have been somewhat reluctant to call out specific percentage of revenue from mobile. But what about just overall online banking, mobile, some of the more digital initiatives on that front. If you can give us a little more color on percentage of your business now, because obviously it's a big growth driver for you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. You're right. We have stayed away from that and we're going to continue to stay away from that at least for today's call. We'll supply a bit more detail on that at Investor Day, because it really is becoming a bigger part of the business. And we actually see it being able to become an even larger part of the business going forward, not just in terms of driving subscription revenue or license revenue or services revenue depending on the deployment method, but also the importance of mobile as it kind of drags along additional capabilities, whether they be payments and the like. So we will definitely spend more time on it. The point that we were trying to make earlier just as it relates to margin, is as you know Darrin, we've been investing in this for a number of years. We're now at the point where we've hit the tipping point and we would expect it to be fairly positive for us from now over the next several years.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I guess later in the year with term fees coming on, or a more normal comp, that's I guess as a follow-up to the question earlier in the call, that should only be better, right?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct, but we're going to continue to make investments as we go, so we obviously are sticking with our guidance right now at 50 basis points, at least 50 basis points for the full year. We need to get past Q2 and take a look at it before we make any adjustments for Q1.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","We did have, as I previously said, Darrin, we did have higher levels of termination fees in the last three quarters of last year, just so you are fully aware of that.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. On a comp basis, makes sense guys. All right. Thanks very much.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next Dave Koning of Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hey, guys. Nice job.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thanks, Dave.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, so I guess the first question, it sounded like you were talking about the second half being better than the first half in terms of growth. But it looks like the second quarter is actually the easiest comp of the year. And I'm wondering, should Q2 be better than Q1 in growth just given it's a much easier comp?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Dave, I would say that again, where we went all the way back to our call, when we kicked off the year in January. We really believe the second half is where it's going to be primarily. And the reasons for that are some of the things that we've already talked about, are the DNA implementations. We're going to have some larger benefits from both our bill payment and international business. Our biller headwinds, we mentioned this, that in our biller business, which is really growing our electronic transactions \u2013 they are double digits \u2013 we've had some tough comparisons. There were some client consolidation and those headwinds are going to abate towards the end of the second quarter. And then also, we talked about our EMV revenue, which is primarily all second half kind of driven. So again, we continue to believe we're going to have a much stronger second half than first half and as we're sitting here today, that continues to be that trend.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. And then I guess the only other question I had, on the postage line, we never really pay attention to that. But is that, are we're going to able to see that clearly ramp? And that's maybe one of the biggest indicators that we can just see the underlying EMV kind of driving the payments growth.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes, I don't think it will be reflected there, because of the card production. But I would comment that as you saw, one of the reasons in our payments segment, our output solutions business was fairly flat. We kind of had a difficult compare, we had compared to the prior year. And again that's one of the businesses where we really expect a better second half, due to the acceleration both in the base business and then also in EMV production. As Jeff highlighted, we're primarily on the debit side, which is going to trail credit and therefore that's when we expect to see that.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks. Good job.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next is Chris Shutler of William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Chris.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","I thought that the comment on the Morgan Stanley relationship was interesting, guys. Maybe you can provide a little bit more detail on how that opportunity developed, who is going to be doing what and maybe just some more color overall on what the product is going to look like.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. It's a unique arrangement. As you may know, we've got a very strong position in, call it just broadly, managed account administration in the U.S. We have a very strong pricing network, a very large-scale business and we've been working with Morgan Stanley for a couple of years. They've wanted to have a way to expand their business. And we began working together to look how could we use our technology with their knowledge of the business and their connectivity outside the U.S. And we basically put this together in a way that allows really them to go out and take the lead, almost prime, go out, make, form and leverage their relationships outside the U.S., get it set up with product et cetera, and then we'll go in and do the managed account administration as we do here.","And so we're quite excited about it. It's nothing that we've done before. And frankly, we have a pretty high level of confidence in this because we spend a lot of time understanding Morgan Stanley's capabilities and how they're going to approach the market. And so we're pretty excited. We think it's going to drive some growth into 2016. It won't have any impact this year, but it's just another driver for 2016.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Sure. Okay. And then just one other one, totally different question. But I was hoping to get an update on the integrated sales effort, specifically with former Open Solutions clients. So just wondering if there is still a big opportunity or just what inning you're in there with that opportunity? Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes sure, Chris. So we just continue to be very, very pleased with the success that we're having in providing additional value-add solutions to that base, whether it's in the DNA base or the total plus base, we've had a lot of success on delivering product. We did a lot of work as you'll recall over the last 15, 18 months in terms of driving what I would call the first level of integration. We're now starting to bring in some of our next tier, higher value, higher integration value products. And so we remain very confident that we're going to hit or frankly exceed the revenue synergy numbers that we talked about when we acquired Open.","The inning question is an interesting question, because from a sales inning perspective, we're probably somewhere in the middle innings in terms of aggregate value sold. In terms of the revenue recognized on that, I would say we're in the very early stages of the ball game, and have a lot of runway left ahead. Some of that is because of implementation queues, some of it is we've signed contracts that don't expire for, where they have competitive agreements and expire for a period of time. But again, that's one of the things that gives us confidence, not just into the second half of this year, but frankly on our exit run rate. So it's pretty early on that opportunity.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. great. Thanks Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So Jeff interesting, as we do a read a lot about real-time payments. Interesting to hear your emphasis increasingly perhaps across Fiserv's business on how faster payments can drive growth. Can you be a little more granular? Do you think most of your opportunities are in terms of market share given your technology sophistication and position or do you think it's pricing or a combination of the two? And I'm thinking about your comments, both with regard to DNA as well as Mobiliti.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so it's a great question and hopefully I'll capture it in this answer. So I think about real-time on several levels, but you've got solutions such as DNA, which I think of a little bit more as a file drawer and we're creating this real-time capability that allows for a lot of optionality to put files in that drawer which are the real-time applications. So it could be deposits, it could be data management, it could be payments, any of those different opportunities. And we're going to see that both in real-time core, but the mandate is coming much more off of how consumers are accessing those technologies or frankly how business owners are accessing those technologies, through Mobiliti and online and the like.","And we're in the enviable position of having both the account processing or the core platform as well as the channels platforms, which we have a very long legacy on the online side that we're now complementing on the mobile side. That however is only part of the opportunity. Frankly, I am at least if not more excited about the second part of the opportunity. And that is today, because of the solutions that we have in the market, be it the CheckFree RXP solution or Popmoney, our ACH solutions, we have rails today, which are slower rails, but are moving many, many, many millions and millions and billions of transactions. And what we're seeing is financial institutions get quite excited about the opportunity to provide real-time capabilities, payments and deposits.","We mentioned that in our prepared remarks, real-time deposit credit is another intriguing opportunity, where institutions can create small fees that make sense to the consumers and make sense to them. So they can create a little bit of fee revenue. Consumers can get what they want from a time-to-move or speed-to-move perspective. And because we're the enabling party, we're getting that as well. And my belief is that we're going to see some meaningful percentage. Take bill pay, where we've got roughly 1.5 billion transactions a year. Some meaningful percentage of those have the propensity to go on a real-time basis. And that will create real value, not just in terms of growing the transactions, but on a rev-per-tran basis that could be very, very impactful to our model over time.","So it's a little bit of a long-winded answer. You can be sure we're going to talk about this at Investor Day, but it's a very, very important opportunity. And uniquely it's a place where the interests of consumers or users, whether they be retail or business; the financial institution, whether that be a bank, a credit union, a lender, a biller whoever it is; and our interests all intersect at this point of real-time.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And that's helpful. Thank you. Would you expect to see the adoption of real time payments or the offer of real-time payments and bill pay, for example, to consumers be accompanied by new fee structures? You know for those of us who've been using bill pay for a long time, we're accustomed to for the most part having free payments, albeit with a lag. Would you expect to see financial institutions introducing more tiered pricing?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, absolutely. And in fact, we talked about our real-time payments being up more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. Almost, I would estimate that virtually every one of those payments carried a premium fee. Every one of those real-time payments carried a premium fee structure. It could be like a reverse interchange, but a variety of different premium add-ons are in that more than 50%.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Brian Bowden (48:37) of Deutsche Bank.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Hi, Brian (48:39).","Unknown Speaker","How you doing?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Been great.","Unknown Speaker","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I was just curious on the EMV opportunity, we're hearing different things. I guess how big of a revenue opportunity is that for you guys? I mean is that upwards of $100 million on an annual basis? And any possibility that they delay the October liability shift that you're hearing about?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, the EMV opportunity is meaningful. There's no question about that. And we're going to talk about that in detail at our Investor Day in terms of quantifying the sizing of that. We have EMV benefits coming from two places. We have EMV benefits coming from our existing debit processing clients. And then we also have clients who are not our debit processing clients who have a relationship with us through our output solutions business, both on the manufacturing and on the personalization side. So we'll spend time at that on Investor Day.","As it relates to the liability shift, we haven't heard anything that would have us believe that that shift, that there is going to be a delay in the shift. So we are at least planning for that to happen on time.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then just one question for Tom. Just how big or if you can quantify the impact of term fees in the guidance for this year that would be helpful. Thanks so much.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes. We don't, I mean we don't quantify certain impacts. It's factored into our guidance. Clearly one of the things I would say, Brian, (50:12) is we're coming off a very strong year in 2014 from a termination fee standpoint, so I mean that's kind of context for it.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. So, it will be down this year on a year over year.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","It's hard to, every year we have puts and takes and things happen in the marketplace and sometimes they come quickly. But we did have a very strong at least last three quarters of last year in regards to termination fees.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. We always appreciate it. And we're looking forward to seeing everyone on June 16 in New York for our investor presentation. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team.

Joining me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Ernst.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted revenue, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, free cash flow per share, sales pipelines, acquisitions and our strategic initiatives.

Please refer to our earnings release, which can be found on our website at fiserv.com, for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this conference call and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.","Also, please mark your calendars to attend our Annual Investor Day, which will be held in New York on Tuesday, October 9. We plan to send out invitations later this summer, and you may also follow up with our Investor Relations team for additional information. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. We again generated strong earnings growth in the quarter, with adjusted EPS increasing 13% to $1.28 and is up 15% to $2.48 for the first half of the year. Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the quarter and 4% through June 30. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and is 2% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was 29.3% in the quarter, consistent with the prior year, and up 60 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin has increased 20 basis points to 29% year-to-date, led by very strong performance in the Financial segment. Free cash flow increased 26% in the quarter to $115 million compared with the second quarter of 2011, driven by growth in operating earnings and favorable shifts in working capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow is down 11% to $298 million, primarily related to higher tax payments.","Strong sales in the quarter led to the second-highest results in the company's history.  Only the fourth quarter of 2011 was higher. On balance, we're pleased with the results for the first half of the year, which are in line with our expectations. We continue to expect and are on track for stronger second half results, which should lead to another year of solid growth and financial performance.","That said, we do recognize that there is more variability in our results this quarter than is typical, which merits further explanation. There are 3 areas, 2 of which are generally timing-related, which impacted our second quarter results. First, the timing of license and termination fees pressured our second quarter growth rate by just over 1%. A swing from the first quarter's results, which had been positively impacted by just under 1%. And although these types of revenue are less than 5% of the company total, on the margin, a few million dollars can move the growth rate in a quarter. Second, we were impacted by several large intricate client implementations, primarily in our online channel business, where significant increases in scope and project duration shifted the timing of revenue from this period to out over the next several quarters.","The last is the impact of several unusual bill payment deconversions, primarily Wachovia, which we have discussed for a couple of quarters within the Payments segment. These impacts were largely anniversary-ed by the end of the third quarter. The cumulative impact of these items on the company's internal revenue growth rate in the quarter is approximately 2.5 percentage points and approximately 1 percentage point for the year-to-date. The majority of the impact is in the Payments segment. These items are also compressing margin commensurately. Tom will provide more color in his discussion of our financial results.","As we shared at the beginning of the year, we are focused on 3 key enterprise priorities in 2012 which more fully represent our formula to create sustainable shareholder value. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality earnings growth and meet our revenue commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients.","Revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date was driven by steady increases in recurring revenue across a number of our traditional businesses, including debit, account processing and lending. The operating leverage in these recurring revenue businesses combined with the continued progress of our operational effectiveness initiatives resulted in 4% growth in adjusted operating income and 20 basis points in margin expansion in the first half of the year, despite the second quarter impacts I just discussed. Adjusted EPS through June 30 has increased 15%, and we're on track to extend our streak of 26 consecutive years of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","Our focus on enhancing our growth culture led to strong sales performance in the quarter. As you know, we announced a deal today with TD Bank, which is the largest electronic bill payment win in our history outside of the Bank of America transaction in 2000. This competitive takeaway highlights the product advantages and network scale that will allow TD to provide world-class bill payment and e-bill services to their customers as part of a differentiated online experience.","Increasingly, the largest financial institutions in the U.S. are turning to Fiserv for an integrated suite of our leading channel and payment solutions to help them harness the power of the digital movement. Speaking of which, we're making great progress adding scale to our new solutions such as P2P, where we have now signed 14 of the top 30 banks in the U.S. and a total of over 1,600 institutions. Our P2P sales pipeline with leading banks and credit unions continues to be very strong. We signed over 400 bill payment debit P2P and mobile banking clients in the quarter, driven largely by existing relationships in our market-leading account processing client base. We now have over 1,100 clients signed for Mobiliti, with over 750 live as of June 30. As users and transactions accelerate, this should have an even larger positive effect on our revenue growth rate.","We had a great quarter against our priority of delivering differentiation and innovation that leads to better results for clients. In June, we successfully combined our 2 P2P products, creating a single integrated solution and network under the Popmoney brand, along with enhanced functionality and multiple payment options. In addition, Popmoney is now integrated and available within the CheckFree RXP payment suite and used at more than 3,800 financial institutions.","Within the currently signed Popmoney network, we have the potential to access more than 40 million online and mobile banking relationships across those 1,600 institutions. There is continuing optimism around the financial industry's desire to drive value to consumers and small businesses through a well-featured P2P solution and scaled network. We have dedicated significant resources to this integration and are pleased with its success.","We also launched our ASP version of Relationship Advance at a regional bank in the quarter. As you may recall from last year's investor conference, Relationship Advance is a deposit-based lending technology solution that enables financial institutions to offer their customers small-dollar loans through Online Banking at a much lower cost than would be available in traditional channels. The ASP-based system streamlines the process, provides immediate customer approval and funding, and offers flexible pricing and repayment alternatives.","Lastly, TruStone Financial Federal Credit Union went live on Acumen, our next-generation credit union account-processing solution in early July. Their new integrated core account system includes a suite of channel and payment solutions reaching its more than 60,000 members, such as Corillian Online, Mobiliti, Popmoney and CheckFree RXP. The success of the TruStone conversion, especially given the complex integration of about 30 internal and external solutions, is a significant milestone for Acumen in the U.S. market.","With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom, who will provide more detail on our financial results.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the second quarter to $1 billion and increased 4% in the first 6 months of 2012 to $2.1 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the second quarter and 2% year-to-date. As Jeff highlighted earlier, there were timing impacts in the second quarter, with license and termination fees, revenue related to large customer implementations and also lower bill payment revenue, primarily attributable to the Wachovia deconversion. Adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.28 in the quarter and has increased 15% to $2.48 through June 30. The Q2 earnings-per-share results exclude a positive discrete tax benefit of $0.10 per share that was recognized for GAAP purposes. This adjustment results in a full year rate which we believe is more indicative of our expected annual adjusted effective tax rate.","Adjusted operating income was $302 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 29.3%, consistent with the second quarter of 2011 and up 60 basis points sequentially, which is compelling, considering the 80-basis-point negative impact in the quarter related to the decline in license and termination fee revenue. For the first 6 months, adjusted operating income increased 4% to $598 million, and adjusted operating margin improved by 20 basis points to 29% compared with the prior-year period.","Now onto the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 4% to $538 million in the quarter and increased 5% to $1.1 billion in the first 6 months of the year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and 2% through June 30. Card services and output solutions continued to drive revenue growth, both in the quarter and year-to-date. This growth was partially offset by a reduction in bill payment revenue attributable to the deconversion of Wachovia, a core competitor that formerly resold CheckFree, and 2 remittance-only clients, which negatively impacted revenue growth in this segment by approximately 150 basis points. Excluding the impact of the bill payment clients I just mentioned, bill payment transactions increased 3% in the quarter and were up 5% year-to-date. At this point, the substantial majority of the comparable bill payment grow-over is behind us. The combination of our recent large CheckFree RXP wins and a strong pipeline of new deals should boost the revenue growth rate nicely in this business.","Also, the timing of software license revenue, large services implementations and Durbin implications in our biller business negatively impacted year-over-year segment revenue growth by approximately 160 basis points. This combined with the bill payment deconversions had a combined impact of more than 3 percentage points on the Payments segment growth rate in the quarter. Debit transaction growth of 16% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date was a result of better-than-market transaction growth as well as the on-boarding of new clients. We added 93 new debit clients over the first 6 months of the year, roughly on par with last year's level. Renewal activity has remained strong, car growth has continued, and volume growth kicked up in July compared with the second quarter.","As Jeff mentioned, we successfully integrated our P2P solutions onto a single platform in the quarter. P2P comparable transaction growth was 123% and 124% in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Although we are seeing strong demand by financial institutions to add P2P, there have been delays in the FI implementation queues and their time line for installation which is impacting revenue. To-date, P2P has yet to meaningfully contribute to our revenue growth.","Operating income for the quarter was $160 million in the Payments segment compared with $164 million in the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date operating income was $321 million compared to $320 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 29.8% in the second quarter, down from 31.7% in the comparable quarter and up 30 basis points sequentially.","On a year-to-date basis, adjusted operating margin for the segment was down 140 basis points. Operating margin was compressed in the quarter due to the timing of license and services revenue, implementation cost, expected dilution from the acquisition and integration of CashEdge and the impact from bill payment deconversions. These items had a combined negative impact of more than 200 basis points on segment margin in the quarter.","Revenue in the Financial segment increased 1% to $502 million in the quarter compared with the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated to 3% compared with 2% in the first 6 months of 2011. We are pleased with the increase in recurring revenue and higher growth rate in the segment, driven by our account processing and lending businesses. The timing of license and termination fee revenue negatively impacted the second quarter growth rate by approximately 140 basis points while positively impacting the first quarter growth rate by about the same percentage. Year-to-date, the combined license and termination fee revenue in this segment is roughly flat to the prior-year period. We anticipate a stronger second half of the year for license revenue based on our historical performance and current pipeline. Volume reductions in our item processing business have impacted revenue growth, both in the quarter and year-to-date, by approximately 1 percentage point.","Operating income in the Financial segment was up 7% in the quarter to $163 million. And operating margin expanded by 170 basis points to 32.5%. This performance is exceptional, given the drag on margin in the quarter from a decrease in higher-margin license and termination fee revenue. On a year-to-date basis, operating income was up 8% to $314 million, and operating margin increased 140 basis points to 31.3% compared with the prior year. Each of the major businesses within the Financial segment contributed to the margin expansion, demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our business model.","Continued progress in our operational effectiveness initiatives also had a positive impact on margin in the quarter. The operating loss in the corporate segment for the second quarter was $21 million and increased by $5 million over the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the timing of marketing expenses, including expenses related to our client conference, held in the second quarter. As you know, we have been keenly focused on reducing our tax rate, which has gone from over 38% a few years ago to an effective tax rate for the first 6 months which is substantially lower. As we mentioned, the adjusted results in the quarter exclude certain positive discrete tax benefits related to prior years totaling $14 million or $0.10 per share. This adjustment results in effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 36%, which we believe is more indicative of our expected annual effective tax rate going forward. We anticipate our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 37%, which does not include any potential benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit.","Net interest expense has declined $12 million year-to-date versus the prior year, primarily associated with lower overall interest rates. In addition, year-to-date investment income was $6 million in 2012 and 2011. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2012 was $298 million, a decrease of $37 million from the prior year, which is primarily due to higher tax and incentive payment accruals paid in the first half of 2012. Free cash flow in the second quarter was back on track, increasing by 26% compared with the prior-year quarter, as we benefit from earnings growth and the reversal of some unfavorable shifts in working capital experienced in recent quarters.","Total debt at June 30 was $3.4 billion or 2.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA. We expect to finalize a new revolving credit facility in the near term, which will likely increase our revolver capacity from $1 billion to as much as $2 billion and extend the maturity to 2017.","We expect to reduce our ongoing interest cost and spread compared to our current facility. We intend to pay off our $1.1 billion term loan, which is due in November, using a combination of financing sources, which may include utilizing a portion of the new revolving credit facility. We only had $20 million drawn on the facility at the end of June. We repurchased 2.1 million of shares of stock in the quarter for $143 million, and year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.8 million shares for $388 million. As of June 30, there are approximately 9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Tom. Sales in the quarter were strong, with quota attainment of 117%, 22% ahead of last year's second quarter, which was a record level at that time. Through the first half of 2012, on a straight-line basis, we're at 90% quota attainment. Our qualified pipeline, which includes a wide range of solutions across all-sized institutions is well above where it was a year ago. We are on track to meet our annual sales target. Integrated sales also improved in the quarter, increasing 38% sequentially to $44 million, with Payments and channel solutions again experiencing the highest demand. Through the first half of the year, integrated sales were $76 million or roughly 38% of our annual target. Similar to the last 4 years, we expect stronger integrated sales in the second half of the year and believe we are on track to achieve our annual objective of $200 million.","We achieved $14 million in cost savings in the quarter and $27 million in the first 6 months of the year, 68% of our annual target. We're well positioned to meet our operational effectiveness objective for the full year.","Before I update you on guidance, I will comment briefly on the environment. Regulatory actions have continued to decline in both frequency and asset size. There have been 46 regulatory actions through July 27 compared to 77 actions during the same period last year. Total assets of the impacted institutions are down by about 2\/3 to just under $10 billion. In a repeat of last summer, the Eurozone crisis is once again front and center in the business headlines. Although this volatility is part of our client discussions, it has not had a direct impact on our business. Less than 2% of our revenue comes from Europe, and the majority of our European revenue is based in countries least impacted by the crisis. We are also seeing FIs consider the impact of increasing pressure in Asia as that part of the world grapples with the implications of slowing growth. The market environment for financial institutions in the U.S. remains generally stable, with regulatory and economic pressures presenting growth and profitability challenges which we believe are likely to persist. Our market conversations are centered on a variety of technology solutions that build and support revenue, enhance customer loyalty across all channels and bridge efficiency. These themes are evident in our product prioritization, sales results, and are well represented in our pipeline.","Turning to guidance, we continue to expect stronger second half of the year, and more specifically, we believe absolute performance will peak at year end, as we have seen over the last several years. We anticipate adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% to 4.5% for the year. Given our strong EPS performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing the bottom end of our expected EPS guidance range $0.04 and now expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.08 to $5.20, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year compared to $4.58 in 2011.","Given the timing of certain sales wins and the impact of a few of our larger implementations, we now expect adjusted operating margin for 2012 to increase in a range of 30 to 60 basis points for the full year versus 2011. We continue to expect free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and that free cash flow per share will be at least $5.70 for the year.","We've made strong strategic progress and remain bullish on our growth prospects for the remainder of the year. Our business model continues to generate consistent financial results, and recurring revenue from our new solutions is beginning to come online. Based on the combination of our current results, macro trends which support our product strategy, and the richness of our sales pipeline, we have solid momentum going into 2013. Of course, none of this would be possible without the incredible commitment of our more than 20,000 associates around the world, which provide me even greater confidence in your company's future. With that, Angie, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jeff, looking at the guidance, obviously, the back half of the year looks to be stronger.  I guess, the 3% to 4.5% organic growth target is out there. To get to that high-end of 4.5%, it looks like you would do 6%-plus or over 6% internal organic growth. Just curious what might be out there.  Are there some big, chunky revenue streams that we should expect in, probably, sounds like in the fourth quarter?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean we -- last year, we had, and Tom can fill this in, I mean, last year, we had a very strong fourth quarter, as I'm sure you recall, significant gains in license revenue. And just given the spending patterns of the last couple of years, we have no reason to believe that, that won't recur again this year. Of course, last year's fourth quarter was quite strong, and even though we think absolute performance will peak in the fourth quarter, given last year's third quarter, it's altogether feasible that the percentage increase in revenue growth itself on an organic basis will be stronger in Q3 than Q4. But there's a lot in the sales pipeline, as I mentioned. And to some degree, it's hard to predict when some of these transactions will come in or not. And so there's a little bit of lumpiness to that, that and some of the points Tom was talking about, just in terms of when some of these larger implementations come online.","Those are the 2 -- those are really the big variables going into the second half of the year.","Thomas J. Hirsch","And I think the other thing as we talked about is we are going to benefit from some of the annualization in the bill payment business, as we highlighted. And that's going to be another important factor as we look to the back half of 2012.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just want to be clear, the adjustment to the operating margin expansion was due to some delays in implementation? I just want to make sure I got that one right.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","There's a couple of things going on there, Bryan. I think one of the things is the -- is both a delay in the implementation, and we have incurred some higher costs. These are very large online banking transformations in some of these larger products -- projects. So our costs have been a little bit higher. The revenue has expanded in these multiyear agreements, so that is a good thing, but our costs have also been a little bit higher also.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then just last question for me, I know at the Analyst Day last year, we talked about network revenues being $15 million this year, Mobiliti $30 million, CashEdge $80 million, just curious to know if those innovation-based solutions are still on target this year, given what you've seen, maybe a few delays out there in some of the FIs?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I would say that the mobile is looking quite strong. The network is looking, actually, very good, certainly given some of the -- some of what's going on out there, so we feel quite good about that. And I would say that we've made a little bit of a conscious decision within CashEdge to focus more energy on technical and product integration, and that was really on the basis of we saw some delays earlier in the year where the market was really waiting for us to communicate what we were going to do and then integrate against that plan. And so we've done that.  As we mentioned, we went live in the second quarter, so we're -- we now have a single Popmoney network out there. However, the implication to that has been, really, that sales were a little bit slower than we thought. And then after we sell it, it obviously has to move into the implementation queues of the client. So I think, I suspect that we will see the CashEdge revenue being a little bit lower this year than we originally anticipated. But in fact, the sales momentum and, therefore, the revenue momentum we see coming -- going into next year will likely be higher than we would have seen otherwise.","Thomas J. Hirsch","And I think just to add to that, Bryan, the -- we kind of highlighted in our comments, we've now signed 14 of the top 30 banks in the U.S., and our pipeline P2P is exceptionally strong. And the implementation queues at our clients, we do run into a client resource constraint from that standpoint, too, but the implementation queue is strong, and I will comment also on mobile that, that business continues to ramp up a very nicely, and that is clearly going to have a good, positive second-half impact this year compared to the first half as those clients continue to come on. So we're very bullish in the Mobiliti space, and that's going very well.","Operator","Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess maybe just a little bit more color. It sounded like, if I heard you right, the sales growth in the quarter, at least year-over-year, was something north of 20% year-over-year, which sounded a little surprising to me, given the environment. Obviously, maybe there were some pent-up demand, given sort of the sales growth wasn't great in the first quarter. But maybe a little bit more color there. Also was the Toronto Dominion deal included in the quarter? And also maybe just a little bit more color on refreshing the pipeline, given the strong sales results in the quarter.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Sure. So we did -- when we announced earnings in the first quarter, we indicated that even though the numbers were little bit lighter than people were probably anticipating, even though we had a record Q4 of '11, that we felt we were on track, and I think our second quarter results show that. Clearly, the TD Bank deal, is -- it was closed in the quarter, and that is included in our numbers. And so a deal of that stature is certainly helpful, and with that deal has been in process for quite a while. And in fact, it was -- it closed a little bit later than we actually originally anticipated. So that was in our number, but we also commented on the fact that our pipeline, even with the strong quarter we had, is actually well above where it was at the same time last year. So even though the environment is kind of -- remains a little bit muted, the solutions that we have been developing and the products that we have been delivering into the market are not at all muted. And in fact, the TD deal itself is really, I think, a testament to the need to -- for institutions to deliver kind of the best possible digital experience, which encompasses both online and mobile. And if you have a great mobile solution but you don't have a wonderful bill payment solution, you're not going to be delivering the most value. And the same thing applies to products such as P2P, products like online account opening, account transfer, risk, fraud, all of that, right, that market is moving very, very quickly. And in fact, to the point that Tom was talking about in his section around these  online transformational deals, one of the challenges that you have in those deals is the market is moving so fast, people are changing their minds and adding requirements and features and functions, which is good news, but it is having an impact on those -- on the completion of those transactions. But the bottom line is, is in those areas, Glenn, where we have been investing, we really have very good macros behind that, as well as those products are surrounding even our core processing solutions, and we're seeing good momentum in that space as well.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","; All right. And on the TD deal, are you -- when -- what's the timing of the conversion, and are you sort of going to get any benefit from revenue in the back half, and does that, maybe, to follow up on Bryan's question, help explain some of the organic growth acceleration in the back half?  Or is it more of a '13 revenue benefit?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","That -- given how late in the year this was completed, that will be a '13 impact to our revenue line. But again, as Tom talked about, as far as the acceleration of the organic growth, one of the things Tom talked about to keeping in line with the topic was the bill pay deconversions. So something like Wachovia, which will fully anniversary this quarter, just by virtue of the fact that you're not growing over that compare will do wonders for the internal revenue growth rate.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then just quickly, Tom, maybe -- you went through a lot of this, but the 190-basis-point drag on payments margins, what were the 2 or 3 sort of major sort of stand-out items that...","Thomas J. Hirsch","Well, we clearly have the bill payment, all right, year-over-year drag of the Wachovia. We talked about the remit-only, that's a piece of that. We also had a decline in the quarter and some license fees in that particular segment, which was the other piece. And then as I talked about, really, timing of these license and services around the implementation. So these larger Online Banking deals, those have kind of had some timing from a standpoint of pushing out more into the second half of this year versus in the current quarter. And that's also going to benefit us well as we go into the second half of the year, but those were the major points. And the only thing I'd add, I think Jeff had a comment around the pipeline earlier, Glenn, and notwithstanding the TD deal, which is now closed, our bill payment pipeline continues to be robust, which is really a good sign in that particular business, even after closing that transaction.","Operator","Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess my first question is in terms of the increase in scope and complexity of your contracts, some of your contracts, are these milestone-based or percent of complete, I mean, how should we think of the implementation-related revenues? And maybe can you give us an example of what are the new things that clients are asking for in terms of increased scope?","Thomas J. Hirsch","I'll take that one, Ashwin, I think, and then Jeff will add to it.  But clearly, and these are specifically when we talk about complexity, right, we have a number of areas in the company where that's at.  Primarily what we're talking about is in our digital channel space in the Online Banking implementation. And we have a number of large ones that are going on in that particular area, which are license- and services-based. And those can be multiyear, percentage-of-completion-type engagements, depending on how much the scope moves, and we've had certain of them where that scope has increased, the contract value has gone up substantially. But it's going to take longer, and that's how those are recognized over that period of time. And that's the primary area, it's not across the entire space. And then we have certain deals in our Acumen where we have a lot of integration with a lot of different solutions where that will be applicable.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","And, Ashwin, to your point on the kinds of things that are being added, you've got everything from the creation of a fully featured account aggregation landing page to a payment dashboard to the addition of services.  So I'd like to be able to allow clients to have P2P where it wasn't anticipated originally. So the -- and part of what's going on there is as there is more and more interaction with mobile, that is changing the paradigm for which clients had originally designed the online experience, so if you just think back, if we did a deal 1.5 years ago, and we're engaged in that, over the last 1.5 years, so much has changed that people are changing their design, whether it's look and feel or services integration, on a fairly regular basis to try to keep up with, really, the movement that we're seeing, primarily on the mobile side, as well as having even in certain situations having us maybe take on some of the mobile design and starting to linkup those experiences, which was what we had anticipated. It's just happening a little bit sooner than we had originally anticipated.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, now that makes sense. Now the TD contract, and congratulations on that, but I guess can you talk about, and maybe I missed this, when is sort of an implementation date for that?  When it starts, I would imagine, materially affecting, positively affecting your revenues?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I would say, we would expect to have a measurable impact on our revenue growth rate in '13 and probably in '14. But we do expect it to be live for most of 2013, but we also know that historically, when we migrate a competitive solution, because of the level of functionality that we have in areas such as e-bill, right, kind of that deep direct connect on the e-bill side, we typically see a much higher level of take than we've seen historically, and it takes anywhere from 6 to 9 months for consumers to understand what they have and to begin using it. So we have a pretty good track record on that. So we would expect a little bit more of leaps in the next couple of years, in '13 and '14, and then have it fall back into a more normal growth rate as you would see in the larger institution. And part of that will depend on how TD Bank ends up using this as a way to catalyze their online experience. But we believe that they're going to make this central to their online and their mobile strategy. They are currently an online client of ours, and we'll look forward to working with them on that and doing a little bit more, hopefully, on the mobile side as well. So we see this to be an important expansion point for the relationship overall.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's good to hear. One housekeeping question.  What are you expecting the quarterly run rate for interest expense to be once you redo the term loan? And I missed the timing of that.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, we're not going to -- I mean, we're going to be -- that will be paid off in November, Ashwin. We have a number of scenarios that we're still running. And it's going to depend how much long-term versus short-term debt we put in. It will be more cost-effective, clearly, than where we're at today from an interest standpoint, but we're going to balance both of those.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And the debt and interest expense this quarter was unrelated, I guess, but...","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, that was -- well, it's a combination of 2 things, one, our decline in overall rates. We did have an investment gain in the quarter similar to a gain that we had in the first quarter of last year. And we've had investment income of about $5 million to $6 million year-to-date, both this year and last year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","But we are benefiting from lower interest rates...","Thomas J. Hirsch","Absolutely.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","This year because of the refinancing that we did last year.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes.","Operator","Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe for Jeff, as we think back to the Analyst Day last year, and just kind of walking through the bridge to the long-term revenue growth outlook here from last year, you guys had laid out this picture of 4% to 8% total growth over some long-term periods. Is there anything in the environment right now that you guys are seeing that would cause you guys to get positive, that type of thinking around that 4% to 8% kind of bridge to long-term revenue growth?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Not at all.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Not at all. And in fact, I would say based on what we're seeing in the environment right now, notwithstanding the fact that we've reprioritized a couple of things, I mean, the energy around something like P2P, to the extent we get that network built right, and the importance of real-time and mobile integration in Q4, really, we are more convinced than ever that that's a game changer in terms of the growth that we would see that solution alone driving over the next several years. So from that perspective, we feel like that -- the CashEdge acquisition will be on track. The network, right, because of the integration that we are going to have with P2P and some other uses of real-time, including looking at it for options around expedited bill payment, we see our network business continuing to grow. We've -- we actually have both year-over-year and sequential quarterly growth in our network business, so that business continues to work well for us. So, and Acumen, you heard us say we're live with our first material U.S. client. So from a perspective of getting up to that bridge, we still feel very good about that, and probably, the thing that is a little bit better right now than we had -- that we were aware of when we were talking at Analyst Day last year is the bill pay momentum that we are seeing. Again, notwithstanding the discussion that Tom had on what happened this quarter, the TD deal, some other transactions in our pipeline, the energy from mobile in terms of bill pay and getting that integration, we're really seeing -- we're seeing new kinds of bill pay users come on, and we believe as mobile scales and the integration scales, that, that will help drive other growth in our existing businesses. So on balance, we probably have more conviction as we sit here today than we did a year ago in terms -- or 9 months ago in terms of driving that 4% to 8%.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just one last one for Tom. When we think about some of the puts and takes this year around expenses and kind of weigh that against some of the cumulative cost-saving goals and the targets that we have, do we think about that any differently in terms of the annual targets to get to that cumulative target of $250 million over the next couple of years through 2015?","Thomas J. Hirsch","No. I mean, I think, the only thing I'd say is we just continue to make good progress. We had a number of things that we have going on. We talked -- I talked last Analyst Day around our check processing business and the efficiencies that we're generating there. And our operational effectiveness were off to a very strong start, and that's why you kind of see some of the results that we have inside of our financial segment notwithstanding some timing that we have with some higher-margin revenue. So continue to be on track with where we're at from that standpoint.","Operator","Chris Shutler from William Blair & Company.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","If you look at the Online Banking and bill payment bases, can you just remind us maybe where you stand today in terms of penetration of the top, call it, 20 or 30 FIs?  And are there many banks other banks out there similar to a TD that might be shopping around, looking for new solutions or looking to outsource something that's currently done internally?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Sure. So on the Online Banking side, we have a fairly high degree of penetration overall in terms of number of online users across our system, and certainly much of that is dispersed across a combination of community institutions and larger institutions. There are a lot of -- there's lots of room for us to grow in the online space in terms of helping folks redesign the experience. I would say that while that is a big -- it's a good opportunity, I think the bigger opportunity is really right now in mobile. That is really more -- getting much more focus within the institutions than online. They're both important, but I think people say, \"Well, I have limited dollars. At this stage, I'm going to bias more to the mobile side of the house.\" And again, as we've talked about before, Chris, we think of mobile and online as being, to some extent, a highway, and then we have to bring as much content as we can, deliver as much content as we can across that highway. So when you think about bill pay, for example, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think we, today, we handle 18 -- around 18 of the top 25 institutions on our bill pay technology.  TD Bank was obviously one that we did not have. There are not a lot of TD Banks, right, TD is, I think, a top 10 bank. So there are not very many of those folks available. But what that shows is for those people who are not using our technology, given the level of savvy, right, this kind of digital savvy that exists in the minds of consumers and the level of empowerment, we're having more and more conversations. I think Tom was fairly explicit that the bill pay pipeline looks quite strong. Well, it looks quite strong because, I think, people are really saying we're at a little bit of a jumping-off point where we need to decide how we're going to manage this channel moving forward. So a bit of a long-winded answer.  There are not lots and lots of those available. But 1 or 2 of these deals make a big difference in terms of, number one, making sure that we're exposing as many consumers as we can to the technology, and number two, keeping in mind that even though we have a very high penetration at the bank level itself, the underlying consumer adoption is still quite low, right, the average adoption within a bank is still less than 20% of the DDAs. So we still have a long way to go in terms of bringing even new bill payment users on into banks where we currently are -- have a position.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on mobile, Jeff, what is the inflection point there? I think you mentioned something happening in Q4 within integration, but can you just review that again?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I think what I was talking about was on the P2P side, right, we expect to have deeper mobile integration and real-time integration in Q4. And we really think P2P is a complete game-changer when it's real time. Right? So the ability to move money real-time to anyone in the United States who has a bank account really is a different deal. And so that really is the inflection point that I was talking about. On the mobile side, while I wouldn't say it's an inflection point, we're quite pleased with what we are seeing.  Transactions are actually higher, adoption is going better than we thought, and Tom, I think, in his comments alluded to the fact that we still even have 3 -- over 300 clients who have signed for mobile that aren't live yet. So we have a good pipeline, not just of new prospects, but turning people live. And so that is not quite at a tipping point yet, but we would expect by the end of this year to have an awful lot of momentum on the mobile side.","Operator","Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan Securities.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to clarify on the TD Bank win.  Was that a remit-only client before that's going full service?  Or was this a full service this way [ph].","Jeffery W. Yabuki","This is a competitive client. They were not our client before, and they are going full-service RXP.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. So this -- all right. So this should be bigger than Wachovia at the point of conversion, I would imagine, then, given the scope.  That fair?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","It would be in that range. I mean, we'd have to go back and do the math, but it should be in that range, yes.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.  No, that makes sense. So the license sales, you called it timing. I don't fully get that. Have these deals or any of these deals have actually closed since the turn of the quarter? And I'm curious what the visibility there could be on the license sales closing before year-end.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, just the -- and I will comment on that, is that these license fees tend to fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And clearly, as you know, we had a very, very strong fourth quarter last year. And first quarter was higher. Second quarter was a little lighter, but as far as the visibility goes in some of these large Online Banking deals, we have very good visibility because a couple of those are a percentage of completion. We know when those clients are going live, et cetera. So we have good visibility on that ramp-up on those deals as we hit the second half. And also the fact is that we've had some seasonality in our business with the license fees being stronger in the second half.  And that's just where we've been last year, the year before and the year before, and we're confident we're going to be there this year again.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, and I would say, on the -- I think Tom was talking about the Online Banking deals where we've got the visibility into when the deals are going to go live. Just want to make sure I clarified that. And then, Tien-Tsin, we do have reasonably good visibility into the numbers for the remainder of the year, of course. The irony is several million dollars can swing any time, and that stuff can move, and that's really some of what we saw happen in Q2. But we feel good about that, and that's really reflected in the size of our current pipeline.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood, understood. Yes, sorry to be nitpick-y about basis points, but I just want to make sure I get that clarification. Last one, I promise, just on the e-bill side, Jeff, why isn't that growing a little bit faster?  I mean, I see the Alliance Data deal, that sounds like it could be interesting. I think TD Bank, you said, was e-bill included. Is there a chance that they -- we see a pickup there with some of the things you've announced?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, actually, there is a reasonable chance that we'll see a pickup there. But 2 things that are going on in e-bill,  they're probably important. We actually have been running some tests on the e-bill side to understand different ways to improve the customer experience. One of the challenges with e-bill is, as I'm sure you know, in order to get the data fed e-bill, you have to be able to provide credentials and other things that allow us to work with the biller and supply that directly in, and that process has been a little clunky over the years. We've actually been working for the last year or so on improving that experience, and we've just begun to move that into production in the second quarter. And we're actually seeing some pretty good results. So that will be moved in throughout the system this year, and we believe we'll start to see some benefit there and certainly into '13. The other thing that's going on is, for people who have known the company for a long time, we have a site called MyCheckFree, where we supply e-bills basically to allow people to pay single bills for clients who have not traditionally had biller-direct sites. And that's really a legacy technology, and over the years, that -- -- those bills have been diminishing, and what you can't see, because we net the numbers out, is e-bill is actually growing on a data-set basis materially higher than you see because the decline coming out of the public site is much larger. And so we care, obviously, a lot more about the coupled e-bill-bill payment experience, but we would do report it on a net basis. And perhaps at Investor Day, we'll break that out so we can -- people can understand how e-bill is actually growing.","Operator","David Togut of Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us some insight on the anticipated timing and -- of the BofA renewal with CheckFree, and along with that, do you expect to retain 100% of the business that you currently have with BofA?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","David, we didn't know how long it would take to get that question, but we're glad that we have it now. We -- as we said last quarter, we continue to work with Bank of America.  Very important client, a very strategic relationship. And we are in discussions with them on a very regular basis on what is the best way to structure our ongoing relationship. We remain optimistic about how that will unfold. I think it would be unfair for me to sit here and indicate that what percentage or not of that we will retain. As you know, today, we provide them with a complete and end-to-end experience. They have a very strong customer experience that they receive from us. We know that the online bank is extremely important to Bank of America. We know that their mobile bank is extremely important, and we know we are very important part of that strategy for them. So we continue to work with them, and we expect that before the end of the year, we'll be able to explain in-depth where that is.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Do they have any inclination to in-source any parts of that contract?  Or are your discussions principally about price?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I think Bank of America would be better served in commenting about Bank of America. I mean, you know the history well for what's happened. And I think we have proven over the last 11 years, right, the Bank of America deal was -- sorry, 12 years, was struck in 2000. We've proven to be a very strong, reliable and dependable partner for Bank of America, and we're confident that we will continue to have an important relationship with them.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Good. And then just a couple of quick follow-ups.  Can you give us some numbers on head-to-head win rates for Acumen versus Scimitar year-to-date?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","We don't have -- I don't have that handy, but I feel confident we'll talk about that in Investor Day. We've continued to perform well with Acumen on a head-to-head basis with Scimitar. Scimitar is a tough competitor, right, there is no question that they do a good job and they have a nice share of that market. By the same token, we have been very, very pleased with the reception of this new technology, which is really only available anywhere in the world through us, and we believe that, that differentiation will allow us to, frankly, win more than our fair share of transactions over the next number of years.","Thomas J. Hirsch","And I think overall as a company, when we look at our sales results, our win rates continue to improve on a year-over-year basis on deals that we're engaged in. So we feel very good about what's going on from a sales standpoint.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Are you, Tom, expecting a significant ramp-up in revenue tied to Acumen in the back half of this year?","Thomas J. Hirsch","We continue -- as I indicated, we have some implementations that are in the queue, and clearly, that's going to help us as we go into the second half of the year, and that is definitely part of that puzzle.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Final question for me, June 30 share count?","Thomas J. Hirsch","I would assume, David, you would ask that. So just hang on one second here. I just got to go find where I have that. There we go. 135.6 million.","Operator","Brett Huff from Stephens Inc.","John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","It's John Campbell in for Brett Huff. Could you guys just give us a little more color on maybe what drove the big processing COGS and incremental margins [indiscernible]?  Would you guys just generally characterize that as more of a -- like cost leverage or cost takeouts?  And then just maybe your thoughts on the sustainability of that going forward.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","You're talking about the cost of goods sold against our processing revenue?","John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Right.","Thomas J. Hirsch","So the efficiency there, is that...","John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Okay. The biggest thing is in our Financial segment. And yes, the most effective thing we have going on there is clearly, if you look at the margins in the Financial segment, we've got a number of things, our operational effectiveness initiatives. I did talk about the check processing business, which continues to -- we continue to operate that very efficiently, and just really across the board, we've seen some good scale economics in that business. And that's been kind of what's driving the overall margins in there.","John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, if you guys can just give us a little bit more color on how Acumen is doing just kind of relative to plans at the first of the year and just kind of versus the growth in size you guys outlined at your Investor Day?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes. Did you say -- John, did you say Acumen?","John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Okay. Acumen.  Our most important priority for 2012 was making sure that we had 1 or 2 showcase clients that feel great about the technology that people can go visit and see the power of the solution. And so TruStone was our first one. That's great. Those folks were taking reference calls within days of the implementation. So we feel like we are on track on that front, and we will continue to build momentum in that area. That said, this is a brand-new core, right, that is -- Tom was talking about areas of complex implementations. This is -- given the architecture and the process flexibility that is inherent in this technology, it is a long and, to some extent, arduous process in terms of working with the clients to get what it is they want out of this new powerful technology. And in fact, it's likely, given the -- how new the solution is, that it will still be a couple of years before we even have credit unions who understand enough about what the technology can do that they're really getting the most out of it.  Which is not surprising. You would see that in any new technology. P2P is the same kind of thing on the consumer side. So it's -- it is doing what it should be doing at this stage.","John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, great, that's helpful. And so given just the recent -- or I guess you wouldn't characterize it as recent, but the complicated integration or the more sophisticated solutions kind of being built in, I mean as you look at it from the first of the year and as you guys have kind of set your sales goal for Acumen for the year, I mean, has that changed?  Do you see revenue being pushed out of '12 into '13?  Or kind of what your thoughts are there.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I would say on the sales side, we continue to be, actually, in good shape. It really is much more on the implementation time line than on the sales side, just because of the very nature of the complexity. We -- I mentioned, I believe, in the prepared remarks that TruStone had around 30 different solutions that required integration. And so that level of complexity, these are large, sophisticated credit unions, and many times, the credit unions are redesigning their own internal processes, which gets integrated into the way that we are architecting the solution for them. So it really is on the implementation side in terms of -- I'm sorry, as opposed to on the sales side. So sales, I would say we're right on track on where we'd like to be on the sales side.","Operator","Greg Smith of Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just real quick to Wachovia, when exactly does that anniversary?  And what is the drag on internal revenue growth?","Thomas J. Hirsch","What we commented on it, primarily it's pretty much done at the end of this quarter, June 30, on that particular piece. And, Greg, what we said is the combination of those the -- those 3 or 4 remit-only, 2 of those I think we had a core competitor reseller, and Wachovia is about 150 basis points inside the Payments segment. And so that's really the drag. You can kind of compute that.  That was in the quarter.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. Okay, perfect. And then the bill payment transaction growth of flat, I know that excludes Wachovia, but I'm just surprised that's flat. Can you just give us some more color on what's really impacting that? It just seems like it should be higher.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, so there were, as Tom or as you referenced, Greg, we did back out of the Wachovia transaction volume because it's obviously significant. But we didn't back out any of the items that Tom talked about earlier, including the certain core competitor that is no longer reselling CheckFree, the couple of remit-only clients. And I think we did announce at Investor Day last year that we had lost 2 RXP clients, kind of larger, kind of mid-tier RXP clients last year. So we've not backed out any of those for purposes of the calculation. That said, that was also the case in Q1 where we didn't -- we're not at that level. And so from that perspective, where I spent my time diagnosing it, it's really 2 things: our largest clients, who maybe have a little bit of a disproportionate share of impact on the growth rate, were slower in the quarter than they were in Q1 -- sorry, slower in Q2, for clarity, than they were in Q1.  And that has a compressing effect on our growth rate. The other thing, though, is there was some kind of anomaly in the quarter. We did some pretty deep analysis on this, which wouldn't surprise you, I'm sure. And virtually every category of client, reseller, small community institution, large client, had lower growth in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And to me, that translates to, probably, a different mix of days in the quarter.  Not the number of processing days, because that we know, but a different mix of days. People pay bills differently on different days. We get those anomalies every year. It just so happened that all of these things conspired together in Q2 to get that number to be where it is. We feel -- we continue to feel good about where we are.  I have every belief that, that number will go back up to where it was, and obviously, with the announcement today, we had a couple of large bill-pay deals that we announced last year, of which at least one of them I can think off of the top of my head is going live at the end of the third quarter, so those numbers will come back up.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then nice to see you keep buying back stock at a healthy pace.  Is there anything in the acquisition pipeline that might cause you to slow down the buyback?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","No.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Excellent. And then -- since I got a quick answer, the dividend.  Any -- and I know you get the question every quarter, Jeff, about thoughts on paying a dividend.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, yes. We certainly do. I should -- I guess should've answered that question a little bit slower, Greg. No, that's fair, though. We look at that on a regular basis. We have -- as you commented, right, we've been very -- we're very disciplined in buying back stock. We think that's a very efficient way to do that. And, frankly, right now, with the tax uncertainty that is in the market, we're not confident that adding a dividend is the smartest thing we could do until the tax implications of dividends are a little bit better understood. But we continue to look at it regularly, just given the free cash flow that we generate.","Operator","Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Jeff, just your thoughts on any change in bank behavior.  Because the constant pressure there on your -- for fee income, are you seeing them look for different products or change their buying habits?  Anything that's changing because of that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean, you hit that nail right on the head. There is lots of revenue pressure within financial institutions to replace the gifts, the regulatory gifts that were provided. And what we're really seeing is people focused on where are those places where we can get more insights into how to sell the next-best product or what's the right way to cross sell. So a fair amount of energy around analytics. And -- but on the fee side, you really have areas like P2P, where many banks are charging for P2P and seeing reasonably good take-ups. At Investor Day, we're going to talk a bunch about how we're seeing the pricing moving in that space and how we believe banks are going to be able to actually create a very attractive stream of revenue, especially as real-time goes live on the fee side. So that's one of the reasons why we're seeing such strong success in terms of banks wanting to add that capability. Relationship Advance is another way that banks can serve a different kind of consumer that they typically wouldn't serve in a far more cost-effective way than that group of consumers would be able to get outside the network, seeing -- and seeing a lot of -- still a lot of energy on -- are there opportunities in prepaids, so just a lot of those different ways to increase revenue slowly. I mean, there's no silver bullet out there. It's really a combination of different factors, so products and intelligence. And then really looking for ways to use the channel as a way to really reduce their operating costs and other ways to create efficiency.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just finally, Jeff, you guys are having a ton of success on the bill payment side, especially the TD Bank side.  Is there pricing in this -- pricing pressure in this -- in that business?  Are you having to compete with price?  Or is it that the solution you have with CheckFree and the RXP is just so much better than the competition that it's allowing you to win?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So I think for years and years and years, people have talked about CheckFree and pricing and price compression, right? So for years, there was always compression in these larger agreements. And I think that has typically been the norm. So I would say that, frankly, the way that the majority of the competitors compete with the RXP product is around price. Right? And that -- and we have said very publicly that there are certain clients, right, that want things from us that -- for a price that we don't think makes sense, and therefore, we won't price it at certain levels. We believe that bill payment used right in terms of creating loyalty, creating retention, creating the use of the data and, frankly, the most fully featured best fraud-protected product in the market, we think, speaks for itself, and frankly, we believe that's why TD chose that. But it doesn't mean there isn't price out there that we deal with, and we do. But our goal is to create more differentiation in the product, especially when it becomes paired up with P2P. And we think that is one of the more important underlying connection points within the \"network of money movement.\" Bill pay and P2P complement each other very well. They're not cannibalizing, they're complementary. So -- and again, we have the leading bank-centric online bill payment system as well as the online P2P system. So we think we're well positioned in that arena.","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As always, if you have any further questions, feel free to contact our Investor Relations group.

","Now I will turn the call over to Peter Holbrook, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Peter Holbrook","Thank you, Carol, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are President and CEO, Jeff Yabuki; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted revenue, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, free cash flow per share, sales pipelines, acquisitions and our strategic initiatives.","Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release which can be found on our website at fiserv.com for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures.","These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and is a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon. Let me say upfront, 2011 was an excellent year. Revenue growth continued to accelerate on the strength of record sales, differentiated solutions and strong client relationships. We delivered record earnings per share and took important steps to benefit our growth, earnings and capital structure for years to come. We are very well-positioned entering 2012. Our results in the quarter were strong.","Adjusted revenue grew 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 4% was the highest quarterly performance in nearly 4 years. Our full-year adjusted internal revenue growth continued to climb, increasing 3% in 2011 versus 1% last year.","Adjusted earnings per share was up 20% in the quarter to $1.27 and increased 13% to a record $4.58 for the year, $0.04 above the high end of our original EPS range. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points over last year's strong Q4 performance and 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was down slightly to 29.2%.","Free cash flow of $734 million was essentially flat due primarily to increased capital expenditures and timing of working capital which we generally expect to reverse. Free cash flow per share increased 5% to $5.09 for the full year.","Free cash flow and free cash flow per share over the last 4 years have grown at a cumulative annual growth rates of 14% and 19%, respectively, reflecting the strength of our business model and consistent execution of our strategies. We allocated over $1 billion in capital in 2011, split about evenly between strategic acquisition and share repurchase.","We also refinanced a large block of our debt at historically low rates while extending our average duration by nearly 50%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain within our targeted debt-to-EBITDA range.","For 2011, we were focused on 3 key priorities: first, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients.","Adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated in both segments in 2011. The majority of our growth continues to be from high-quality recurring revenue in our existing businesses. Innovative new solutions such as Mobile, P2P and Acumen are important element of our plan to further accelerate growth and are just beginning to ramp. Adjusted EPS growth of 13% marked our 26th consecutive year of double-digit growth. Earnings grew while investing in these new solutions that should have the dual benefit of accelerating revenue growth and expanding margin.","Fostering a step change in our revenue growth is a rationale for centering the Fiserv culture on growth. The record success of our single sales organization is a proof point to that focus. We have significantly increased our expectations for sales performance in each of the last 2 years, and that's leading to better results.","In 2011, we attained 116% of quota which translates to an absolute increase in sales of 20% over 2010. For those keeping score, you may recall that our absolute sales in the second quarter were the highest in the company's history. Just 6 months later, the fourth quarter sales results set a new high watermark topping the Q2 performance.","We are also seeing increased productivity from our account managers across the company which adds to our ability to more closely match our solutions to the needs of our client base.","Differentiating solutions through innovation that leads to better client results is our highest priority. Financial institutions are rightfully focused on driving revenue and increasing efficiency to restore earnings lost over the last several years. The recent Fed announcement that interest rates are expected to stay extremely low through late 2014 exacerbates that emphasis, with technology playing a key role in solving the revenue and efficiency equation.","During the year, we acquired solutions that strengthened our leadership in channels and payments. First, we acquired M-Com, a global leader in mobile banking and payments, to solidify our position in a rapidly growing market. This allows us to control the development of mobile capabilities and complement our leadership positions in Online Banking, Account Processing and Payments.","We also acquired Maverick solutions to provide financial institutions with a suite of prepaid capabilities to capture new streams of revenue.","And importantly, we acquired CashEdge, the market leader in account-to-account transfer, online account opening and funding, P2P and data aggregation.","Each of these solutions can drive differentiation and revenue for our clients. As we enter 2012, we remain bullish on the opportunity to digitize approximately 11 billion U.S. P2P transactions, totaling $865 billion that are originated each year. Nearly 1,400 financial institutions have signed on to the Fiserv P2P network, which we expect to grow dramatically over the next several years.","We are also beginning to see financial institutions support mass marketing for P2P. For example, NFL fans may have noticed that Citibank ran a 15-second TV spot promoting not P2P, but Popmoney, during a playoff game on January 15 and it's run several times since. We also know that Allied Financial has been advertising Popmoney nationally on the radio. This marketing support has come via our customers and reinforces the belief that P2P enhances their consumer value proposition.","With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom to provide more details on our financial results.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff said up front, adjusted revenue growth was 6% in the quarter and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4%, the highest since the first quarter of 2008. Strong license sales in our Financial segment drove top and bottom line performance in the quarter as the year-end volume behavior we saw in the last 2 years repeated again in 2011.","Revenue growth accelerated once again in 2011 with full-year adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% compared with 1% last year. Adjusted internal revenue growth improved in both segments. Payments growth was up 1 percentage point to 4% and the Financial segment was up sharply to 3% compared to flat in 2010.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 20% in the quarter to $1.27 on strong operating performance and grew 13% in the full year to $4.58 which exceeded our original guidance range.","Strong revenue growth in the quarter, much of it from higher-margin solutions, drove adjusted operating income up 7% to a record $325 million for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 30% in the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points which includes an approximate 130-basis-point negative impact from a discretionary profit-sharing accrual and higher commissions related to the record sales performance in the quarter, much of which supports future revenue.","For the full year, adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points compared to last year as the operating leverage from revenue growth and the success of our operational effectiveness initiatives were offset by investments in new solutions such as Acumen, P2P and Mobiliti, higher expenses in the Corporate segment and the incremental employee compensation expenses recorded in the fourth quarter. Now on to the segment results.","Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 5% to $558 million in the quarter and increased 6% to $2.1 billion for the full year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter. Both year-over-year and sequential growth comparisons were negatively impacted by the completion of the Wachovia bill payment de-conversion, less bill payment processing days in the quarter and a reduction in non-financial institution revenue resulting from the Durbin Amendment.","Adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 4% for the full year, as compared to 3% in the prior year. Full income remained at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 4% in the quarter and 6% in the year excluding the impact of the Wachovia de-conversion. The bulk of this de-conversion will anniversary in the middle of 2012.","Our debit business continued to perform well in the first quarter of the new debit interchange fee structure under Durbin. Debit transaction volume increased 18% in the quarter and 19% in the year, driven by the continued expansion of our client base and the above-market transaction growth experienced by our clients, the great majority of which have assets below the $10 billion threshold of the Durbin legislation.","Operating income in the Payments segment increased 4% in the quarter to $174 million and grew 5% to $656 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin decreased 30 basis points in the quarter to 31.2% and decreased 20 basis points for the full year to 31%. The continuing investments in Mobiliti, P2P and Internet banking, along with the incremental employee costs in the quarter, pressured margins. In addition, the CashEdge results had a dilutive impact on segment margin in the quarter and for the full year.","Financial segment adjusted revenue was $540 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the full year, reflecting adjusted internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 3% for the year. As we anticipated, we saw a significant increase in higher margin revenue, such as license fees in the quarter. That result, combined with our steady core Account Processing growth, contributed to the highest quarterly growth rate in our Financial segment in the last 4 years.","Operating income in the Financial segment was up a very strong 11% in the quarter to $178 million. Operating margin expanded by 140 basis points in the quarter to 33.1%, due largely to the expected increase in higher margin revenue.","For the full year, operating income grew 4% to $613 million compared with $591 million in 2010 and operating margin increased 30 basis points to 30.6%.","Operating margin for the full year was positively impacted by continued leverage in our core Account Processing businesses, incremental savings from our operational effectiveness initiatives, increased efficiencies in our Item Processing business, partially offset by solution investments such as Acumen, Relationship Advance and our common loan origination platform.","Our adjusted effective tax rate of 37% for the quarter was in line with expectations and the 36% full-year rate is a healthy improvement over 2010. For 2012, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in line with 2011 at approximately 36%.","In addition to the continuing implementation of focused strategies that have had the cumulative effect of lowering our tax rate for the last couple of years, our rate estimate assumes also the renewal of the R&D credit in 2012.","Free cash flow increased a strong 12% to $227 million in the quarter. Full-year free cash flow was essentially flat at $734 million and was impacted by a $17 million increase in capital expenditures which includes our data center transformation project and changes in working capital.","We had a $60 million increase in accounts receivable versus the comparable prior-year quarter, resulting from our strong revenue finish to the year. We anticipate the year-end spike in accounts receivable in 2011 will convert to cash in 2012, resulting in higher-than-typical free cash flow guidance which Jeff will cover later.","Free cash flow per share grew 5% to $5.09 for the year as a result of our disciplined capital allocation.","We paid off the $120 million in the quarter that have been added to our revolver associated with the acquisition of CashEdge and have a 0 balance on our $1 billion credit facility at year-end. We will also refinance our $1.1 billion term loan which matures in November during 2012.","At this time, we do not anticipate significant interest savings from a refinance given the current rate structure and our bias towards longer term debt maturities as part of our capital structure. We repurchased 8.8 million shares of stock in 2011 for $533 million which included 1 million shares in the fourth quarter for $58 million. This compares favorably to the 8.1 million shares repurchased in 2010 even as we completed several strategic acquisitions during the year. As of December 31, there are 4.7 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authorization.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Tom. Our record sales in the quarter were up 28% over last year's also strong fourth quarter. Full-year sales landed at 116% of quota, an absolute increase of 20%. Sales strength continued in areas aligned with our strategies including significant wins in channels, payments and Account Processing. Examples of our many digital channel wins for the year include Navy Federal Credit Union for Corillian online banking, Regions Bank for Corillian business banking and U.S. Bank for Mobiliti. ","We ended the year signing nearly 400 new Mobiliti clients and are positioned to exceed that number for sales in 2012. We added 435 new bill payment clients, including the return of Zions Bank. We also gained nearly 200 debit clients during the year and had increased the number of clients within the ACCEL\/Exchange debit network. Overall in 2011, we recorded more than 1,200 wins in bill payment, debit and P2P.","We're pleased to announce that we inked a multiyear extension of our long-standing reseller relationship with Intuit. In addition to traditional Bill payment services, we're working to enhance those client relationships through a set of payment solutions that should provide value over the next several years. In Account Processing, we continued to win over 50% of all of the competitive deals in the market. Momentum continued to build with 5 Acumen sales deal signed in the quarter and a total of 8 U.S. wins for the year.","As we continue to win larger multiproduct deals, as well as ramp up our newer solutions, we continue to expect that revenue will be recognized over a 12- to 24-month period and that recurring revenue builds over time. Given our experience with sales over the last several years and the complexity of the opportunities we are pursuing, we expect sales cycles to remain long and that will have the effect of skewing revenue to the latter part of each year.","Integrated sales were a very strong $71 million in the quarter. Once again, channels and payments were the most popular solutions leading the way to $184 million of integrated sales for the full year or 119% of our 2011 target. Our operational effectiveness results were excellent with $18 million of benefit in the quarter and $45 million for the year, exceeding our 2011 target by 80%.","Our view of market conditions remains generally consistent with that of our third quarter call and Investor Day. 2011 ended with 110 regulatory actions, impacting 92 banks and 18 credit unions, a reduction of about 40% from 2010. As important as the number, institutions impacted by regulatory actions in 2011 were much smaller than in previous years. Over the last 4 years, and contrary to some exaggerated estimates at the peak of the financial crisis, less than 500 financial institutions have been subject to a regulatory action in the United States.","During that period, we lost less than 25 Account Processing clients due to actions which is likely less than if we had been in a more typical M&A environment. In 2012, we expect the number of regulatory actions to continue to decline probably to less than 90 this year. To date, there have been 9 regulatory actions versus 11 last year.","De novo activity continued to be very low with only 3 new charters issued through September 30 and we believe that level of activity will continue in 2012. We anticipate voluntary M&A to be about consistent with its current level. We expect IT budgets to be prioritized to areas that drive revenue, allow ease of movement within and across channels and deepen customer relationships. We believe growth in technology spend will approximately -- approximate the 2011 levels, with a bias towards spending in the second half of the year.","Overall, we believe the end market is solidifying. The questions of institutional survival are increasingly rare and the discussions are now centered on moving forward in a new world of competitive banking. Our key priorities for 2012 remain substantially the same with an added emphasis on aligning our focus against the secular momentum we see in the market.","Guidance for 2012 is based on an assumption that technology spending and the overall environment will be substantially similar to 2011. As I mentioned, we believe there has been a secular change in purchasing behaviors which biases non-time-sensitive technology decisions to later in the year. This change in historic buying patterns should continue to have the effect of pushing more of our sales and revenue growth towards year-end.","For 2012, we expect total adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4.5%. Revenue growth for the year includes a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points from a reduction in revenue due to the Durbin Amendment not sourced through financial institutions.","Overall, we expect our revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of the year. We expect 2012 adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 14% or a range of $5.04 to $5.20 compared to the $4.58 earned in 2011.","Each year, our revenue and EPS guidance incorporates the impact of contract renewals that we expect during the year. Our 2012 guidance for adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS includes an estimate for the range of likely outcomes related to the possibility of an early renewal of our Bank of America bill pay contract. We anticipate that overall adjusted operating margin will increase 50 basis points or more in 2012. We also estimate the free cash flow for 2012 will increase 8% to 12% and that free cash flow per share will be in excess of $5.70 for the full year.","Our 2012 integrated sales target is $200 million and our operational effectiveness objective is $40 million, which will exclude any nonrecurring costs related to the multiyear cost-saving effort.","As I said up front, we had a very strong year. Revenue growth is stepping up, sales results are reinforcing the value of our solutions and we are benefiting from secular momentum in areas of new investment. The experience, talent and commitment of our associates gives us confidence that we will deliver value for years to come.","With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just in terms of thinking about the guidance for the year. Is there a way to sort of parse through the organic growth rates, the 3% to 4.5%, between Financial and Payments? Just to get a sense for what you guys expected to drive that or is this a fairly balance kind of view in terms of the growth expectation.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, I would expect that over time, our Payments segment will continue to be above our Financial segment growth rate and that's how you should model that.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just in terms of context, as we started the year, there's a concern that a lot of the big banks and even some of the smaller banks could see a continued consolidation of branches, closures of branches and now you have kind of this lower -- a longer [ph] situation with the Fed and continued NIM compression. But it sounds like you guys feel like that's more opportunity than it is risk. Can you just help us understand how that kind of a backdrop actually helps drive opportunity for you guys?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, I mean, Julio, I think for us, what we see is a number of different solutions, many of which we profiled at Investor Day, have gotten a lot of attention as institutions are looking for ways to drive revenue. So whether it is with P2P or Relationship Advance, a series of different products like that, we're having some good success. By the same token, kind of the movement around branches, those kinds of things, you're seeing a lot of energy on the electronic channel side. So Online Banking, we announced a win in the quarter with Navy Federal Credit Union. They've decided that they're going to transform their Internet banking presence, U.S. Bank last year, Westpac the year before that. And so those are just some of the larger institutions. But we're really seeing that energy across as institutions are trying to move both transactions and service to lower-cost channels and mobile is also a derivative of that as well. So lots of energy on that side. And then there's a need for the institutions to start to wire those -- the information and insights that are coming out of those channels together to create a better picture of the experience. So from our standpoint, given that we put so much focus in those areas, we see that being fairly valuable. And then last, I would say that overall, as we see institutions looking to just kind of step down their cost structure, given some of the spread pressures that now appear to extend out through '14, you see vendor consolidation and just general more bundling which, to some extent, gets to some of the larger sales that we've had, but also gets a little bit to the longer implementation cycles.","Operator","Glenn Greene, Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A few questions. I mean, I just want to make sure I heard you right, Jeff. On your technology spending comment, you're basically suggesting flat which actually seemed a little bit more subdued than at the investor event. One of your peers sort of had their call yesterday and actually seemed pretty bullish for 2012 somewhat surprisingly. So it kind of sound very cautious to me surprisingly. Maybe a little color there?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, Glenn. I may have misspoken if it came across as flat. What I'm saying is we expect, the general rate of IT spend to be consistent year-to-year which is what we said at Investor Day, what we also said in the quarter. We think that rate is -- we haven't seen the final numbers, nor has anyone. We think there was some growth during the year but we think that level of growth has turned out to be less at the end of the year than people thought it would be at the beginning of the year. So...","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So you're meaning the rate of growth could end up being 2 or 3, that's what you're thinking you for '12 also?","Jeffery Yabuki","Exactly, yes, the rate of growth. But I also want to make it clear that within that rate of growth, we see far more spend being allocated to channels and payments and efficiency-oriented products. But areas in which you can change and differentiate your value proposition, Mobile is the one that comes to mind the most, especially in the larger institutions. People are biasing their spend decisions in those areas.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then you brought up the potential early BofA contract renewal. I want to make sure what you're messaging. Because I would think, if you renew it, obviously, later in the year, it's not going to really impact '12, it would impact '13. So I wanted to understand what you're communicating. And assuming we had an early renewal of BofA, would that imply you might be toward the lower end of your EPS range or just how should we be thinking about that?","Jeffery Yabuki","So our intent was to make sure that we provided guidance that would incorporate the range of possibilities that could happen for an early renewal. It's not unusual that a contract of -- actually any of the larger contracts end up getting renewed early. And sometimes in renewals there are discounts, sometimes there not. But what we did is we spent a lot of time to make sure that we had incorporated that range of outcomes so that's in our guidance. So I think mathematically, to the extent that there was a discount given, right? And that certainly is within the range of possibility if there was a discount. If it happened in January, it would likely be larger just mathematically than it would be in December. So from that, I think the math that you're thinking about is likely the right math. We should be clear, right, that we also wanted to try to avoid some negativity that was directed a couple of years ago, or 3 years ago now, when we renewed the Bank of America agreement after we had given guidance. So at this stage, given the expiration in '13, we thought we would be best to incorporate it into our guidance for the year. But let me -- I probably should add one more point. We do not -- we're not sitting here today knowing that there is a number, right? It's just a range of different possibilities that we have discussed in terms of formulating our guidance.","Operator","The next question is from Dave Koning, Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, in the Payments segment, the last 4 years, the margins have been remarkably stable kind of between 30% and 31.5%. And I know you did a nice job explaining CashEdge, some investments in bonuses in Q4. But is it fair to say that given the ability to leverage a lot of that, what you talked about at the Investor Day, that there is clear potential for several years of nice expansion in that business after 4 years of a kind of pretty stable margin?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Absolutely, Dave. I mean, and I'll turn it over to Jeff, but the things that we have going on in there right now that are particularly impacted '12 is the number of the investments that we have in here, and I think I highlighted these on Investor Day, Mobile as a great example. We have invested a lot in scaling up our ASP infrastructure. And clearly, that recurring revenue is not really even started to come on yet. And so we have a lot of that infrastructure build that's in this segment along with a lot of investment in P2P and then really in the online channel. We mentioned again another transaction with Navy Federal. We've had really a big ramp-up in our development operation in Online Banking and also in the ASP channel, just a lot of activity there. So we've had a good amount of investment which has kind of kept those margins fairly flat. But if you look at our debit card business, if you look at the Bill payment business, you look at P2P, which is really not started yet, those businesses have great economic characteristics and those will continue to scale and incrementally add to margins.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, the only other thing I would add to that, Dave, is we have been, the Wachovia transition, which really began occurring in early '10, late '09, and so that has been holding down. That is now complete. And so we'll have some compare issues but from a -- it's out of the numbers, it's out of the numbers. And so we should be able to not -- having to recover that's relatively large client has certainly pressured our margins.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just one follow-up question, I think debt to EBITDA, trailing EBITDA, it's not 2.2x. It's well below. And by the end of the year, if you just paid off debt, you'd be at something like 1.5x. Is there any reason for us not to expect you to keep it around this 2.5x level? And would buybacks be kind of the most likely and then the next likely would be acquisitions?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. I mean, I think our debt to EBITDA actually did. I think I got around 2.4x somewhere in there but it's well within our range of our target which is 2x to 2.5x. And so we're comfortable with that amount and especially with our EBITDA accelerating growth as we go into 2012. And so we're fine with that. And clearly, as you know, we're going to continue our disciplined capital deployment and share repurchase is really our benchmark from that standpoint.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I would say that the strategic acquisition that we did last year has put us in a very good place, a very good place in the market. And we have a significant amount of opportunity that we want to ensure that we capture. So I don't -- at this stage, it's hard for me to see a need to do acquisitions. It doesn't mean that we won't do smaller tuck-ins here and there. But from kind of a global view of capital allocation, I mean, we feel like we're in very good shape in our product portfolio and we're going to be focused on execution. I mean, for us, we put a lot of money into our products over the last few years. We put a nice sum of money into acquisition last year. We're very, very motivated in putting this out into the market. We think one of the keys to accelerating transactions is integration into mobile. It brings in -- for example, it brings in a whole other consumer, potentially a new consumer and a new consumer who likes to transact. We're not fighting at point of sale. We're really looking for us to be able to accelerate DDA-based transactions and whether that is through Bill Pay or e-bill -- I'm sorry, whether that is around bill pay or e-bill or P2P, account-to-account transfer, account opening, all kinds of other places that are nicely served by creating that mobile channel. Again, as an example, we had a lot of opportunity to execute and that's really going to be our focus.","Operator","Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The question I have is, on a quarterly basis, how should we expect adjusted segment level internal revenue growth to track? Are you sort of calling the bottom on Payment's internal growth rate trend here? And is the higher financial level internal growth sort of here to stay through the year?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, Ashwin. How I would put if you look at 2012, and I think we're pretty, overall in these comments, is that we're clearly going to have -- we're going to bias towards the second half clearly because we have seen a shift, clearly as you saw in our Financial segment in the fourth quarter, where we have this buying behavior by our clients tended to move out more to the third and primarily in the fourth quarter, particularly in that segment. So we anticipate a stronger second half. The other thing we have going on in the first half is the anniversary, as Jeff talked about. A little bit highlighted the Wachovia de-conversion, which is out now but was in our base in the first half of 2011. So that's going to have a little bit more difficult compare in the Payments segment. So again, we anticipate stronger second half growth rates, really, in both segments over the first half.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And you had good sales. Any comment on unusual costs associated to it, associated with converting the sales into revenues, ramps  and things like that? Anything unusual to watch out for?","Thomas J. Hirsch","No, and I'll turn it over to Jeff. As you mentioned, Ashwin, we had a fantastic sales quarter. I think we're at 170% of quota and a number of these transactions are -- some of those will impact '12 and a lot of those will impact '13 and '14. There's some fairly large transactions. We don't have any unusual costs associated with those. We did, in the fourth quarter, clearly have some incremental commissions and some of that, we expect those commissions upfront. And some of that revenue will not hit until '13 or '14. But we don't have any unusual costs. Some of the larger deals are more complex and take longer to implement, but we don't have anything unusual from a cost standpoint.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, it's interesting. One of the things that we've -- I guess, I'll say one of the phenomena that we've seen over the last couple of years is in connection with some of the challenges that FIs had, when they're looking to make these investments, they're often looking to reduce cost, their own cost structure to fund some of the investments. So take Internet banking, for example. One of the clients that we announced that we signed this quarter, it\u2019s a very significant transformation of their technology. But we're also going to be hosting that for them. So there are all kinds of intricacies around revenue recognition where you're building and hosting. And from our standpoint, we make those decisions not based on rev rec. We make those decisions on what creates the most value. And so we'd rather have a larger deal even if it creates an issue around us deferring revenue for some period of time. And we do that as -- anytime we have that opportunity, we do that. So to Tom's point, you'll have those kinds of anomalies. But from a cost perspective, beyond the commissions that Tom referenced, and we've had steadily increasing commissions because we've had steadily increasing strong sales performance. I would say that's the only issue. And that's -- to the extent there was any surprise in the fourth quarter, that was probably one of them. Our sales were so strong and that revenue is largely not in the quarter, that created a bit of a mismatch on the commission versus revenue benefit.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And last thing, if I may. Not so much for question because I think I know what you're going to say. But it comes up with a high proportion of investors especially given your cash flow and only going to do tuck-in acquisitions, any thoughts on the dividend?","Thomas J. Hirsch","We actually -- as we I think mentioned at Investor Day, we look at this issue every year. We think it's important. We know that, that cash is not ours. We know it belongs to the shareholders. And our analysis to date has shown for companies like us that are very, very disciplined in share repurchase, that the return differentials don't favor dividends. That said, the thing -- the other thing that weighs on us right now is, I would say, the tax uncertainty around dividends. Right now, we know share repurchase is advantageous to shareholders who are not selling because in fact, right, they're getting more value and \u2013- it\u2019s on a tax-deferred basis. But we're paying a lot of attention to that and we continue to do that. And we will continue to evaluate dividends and share repurchase as we move forward.","Operator","Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. I heard the steady bank IT spend outlook in the back-end-loaded comment. I get that. But I guess, it's a little bit more optimistic than what some of the bigger banks or the diversified tech suppliers are saying about financial services spend. So I'm curious if that's more a function of maybe your bank clients being relatively healthier or maybe just a greater interest in outsourcing. Can you contextualize that for us, Jeff?","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure, that's a good question. We think that -- the environment has become more stable just because more of the rules -- the more the rules are known and people are -- institutions, especially larger ones, are taking action to make sure that they can do what they need to do around growing revenue. But really around growing earnings. So on one hand, we are seeing people spend. On the other hand, we're also seeing some of the larger financial institutions take people-oriented actions and take steps to reduce their cost structure. The benefit that we have and the reason why we probably have more optimism than some is we're quite confident that the areas in which we have been investing in over the last several years, as well as existing solutions like bill payment, they're just not viewed as discretionary. Now I haven't met a single \u201cbanker,\u201d right, someone who runs a large institution, whether it's a credit union or a bank, who is willing to defer a mobile decision. People just are not willing to do that and they're really looking for ways to drive revenue. And that, right now, is a good fit for us given where we have chosen to invest over the last several years. Don't get me wrong. I still think there's a lot of -- there's going to be a lot of profitability pressure in financial institutions. I still think we're going to be subject to price compression as we have been. And I don't think there's anywhere near -- wallets being opened up very wide. So from that standpoint, that's why we are taking what I would say a more pragmatic view. We think spend will be about -- I'm sorry, I should clarify, the rate of technology spend growth will be about the same year-over-year. But we'll see -- we think it will bias more to the areas in which we're well-suited right now.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good. That's good color. And just a couple of clarifications. That delta in the margin from your guidance for '11, was that all tied to the discretionary bonus or were there some other factors that I missed?","Thomas J. Hirsch","It's primarily that and the commissions as we talked about. We finished the sales year really strong and a lot of that is an [ph] impact revenue in '11. And a lot of that's going to impact us later in '12, and into  '13 and '14. And so that was a little bit a higher than we planned. And then the discretionary profit-sharing, that was about 130, I think, basis points I said in the second quarter. And that was the primary impact.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And the 50 bps you mentioned tied to Durbin, what was that exactly? And then finally, just Intuit and bill pay, was there a change in the scope there, because I know what your -- I guess FIS made some comments around Intuit as well. I'm just trying to reconcile that.","Jeffery Yabuki","So we had been in discussions with Intuit. We signed a multiyear renewal of our reseller agreement. I know that there had been some other discussions in the market. We spent a lot of quality time with Intuit and came up with a pretty interesting value proposition for Intuit and for us. We think it's a win-win, and we believe we will have a relationship, an important relationship, with Intuit for quite a while. So we feel good about that. We recognize that it's a little bit different than what it had been in the market previously, but we feel good about that. And Tom, why don't you take the...","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, and I think the other question was around the Durbin impact. And this relates to the -- this is not related to financial institutions. This is not related to our debit business. We do have a variety of contractual arrangements with non-financial institution clients, really our billers, which are going to be impacted by the lowering of the debit interchange, as you know, as mandated by Durbin. And so we came up with an estimate and we've included in our 2012 guidance. Our best estimate of that revenue impact, which is negative by about 50 basis points, and so that's what we incorporated into our guidance.","Operator","David Togut from Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","David Togut. Just to start off with, did you raise your operational effectiveness target for 2012? I thought you said $40 million. So if that's on top of $45 million you're saying a cumulative of $85 million through 2012?","Thomas J. Hirsch","That's correct.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And that's up from $65 million previously?","Thomas J. Hirsch","That was our initial target. That's correct.","Jeffery Yabuki","We overperformed -- we had such a strong year this year that over performance just gives us a higher cume.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And can you handicap for us the, I guess, relative difficulty of hitting that target and what has to go right and what could go wrong?","Jeffery Yabuki","Instead of handicapping it, what I would say is, we provided the target that we believe we're going to achieve. And if we didn't think we would achieve it, we wouldn't give it. And that said, right, all of this takes work and energy and we'll execute against -- we'll do our best to execute against it but we have a pretty high degree of confidence that we'll achieve that.","Thomas J. Hirsch","And we have a good year 1, David.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then you highlighted 5 Acumen signings in the fourth quarter, 8 through 2011 as a whole. Can you take us down into those signings a little bit? How many of those were, let's say, de novo banks? How many of those were existing Fiserv customers? And how many were head-to-head competitive wins?","Jeffery Yabuki","So none of them were de novos. These are all -- they tend to be larger credit unions. They're all well-established credit unions and every one of them was competitive. Now some of them were our clients on a platform that they decided to move to Acumen. And anytime a client decides to make a platform decision, they always decide, \"Well, if I'm going to make a change, I'm going to look at the universe out there.\" So from that standpoint, you always have that as a competitive scenario. There were a couple of them that are completely new to the company. And all of them, all of the Acumen clients, bought not just Acumen, but bought large bundles of Fiserv content. So everything from bill payment to debit to GL [ph] to all kinds of things, but they tend to be very, very broad-solution bundles. And part of it is, we have said that, from our standpoint, we think this technology is so important and so advanced that we want to be cautious about when we sell it. And for us to sell it, we want to select clients who want to make a very strong commitment to Fiserv. So that's really been our strategy so far with Acumen.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","How many of the Acumen signings were new Fiserv customers entirely?","Jeffery Yabuki","I think it's 2 or 3. But we have -- we'll follow up with you on that.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Because remember, David, many of these clients too our paying us today,  they're in-house clients, certain of them, and they're paying us existing maintenance. So when we move into these new bundles, there's a good amount of incremental revenue, as Jeff was commenting especially around the solution bundles.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. The total incremental value of these deals is significant, whether they're an existing client or not.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And most of this is 2013 and 2014 revenue?","Jeffery Yabuki","It really -- most of it was not 2011. And so it starts to -- we start to convert clients in '12. But it'll be -- so you'll start to see some of it come on in '12, more in '13, more in '14, more in '15. So it's going to step up like the majority of our other revenue.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think David, we laid that out on Investor Day where we had some revenue charts in there, and that's what we'll be kind of tracking along to.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a quick final question. Tom, the 6% organic growth in Financial segment. You highlighted the strong software signings, the back-ended-weighted nature of this, of sales cycle. Can you give us a little more granularity on the 6%? I mean, how much of that, you think, is a recurring number that we can expect?","Thomas J. Hirsch","I would say there's always a portion of that growth that is recurring but a large part of this is add-on license sales to existing customers. And clearly, it just fell more on one quarter, David, than typical. I mean, we had -- our license sales are probably, up $30 million or $35 million from the third quarter. And so we just had a bulk of them, and these are small, typical licenses that are add-on to existing clients. And so typically, it's more spread out. And again, remember that these are primarily sales to existing customers. These aren't new clients. So again, these are clients that are buying additional content from Fiserv. It just more fell into the fourth quarter. So when you bring up the recurring nature of it, it clearly is a license fee. But again, we anticipate that there's always going to be new products that we're putting through our system. And so that add-on sale will continue as we continue to develop and distribute new products.","Jeffery Yabuki","I think one of the ways you may want to think about, David, is we mentioned in the call that given what we saw this year and what we've seen the last couple of years and some of the pressure that certainly exists on financial institutions, clients are holding onto their budget, right, for a long time. And therefore, we expect, and we can see this very clearly in our numbers, that we're going to see these spikes during the year. But to Tom's -- during the fourth quarter, and we expect that again to see that again in 2012. If the spike didn't occur, we would expect that revenue to move around quarters. There's a level of these incremental license sales that's just natural and we've seen over the last few years is it's just moved to later in the year which creates the spike. So when you say, \"How much of the 6% can I count on?\" You may not be able to count on it in a quarter. But we are very confident that we've been stepping up our growth rate. But again, it's hard for us to predict on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But on a full-year basis, that rate is stepping back up and we believe that what you saw in the fourth quarter will translate to '12, but we can't tell you exactly what quarter that will happen in.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Shutler, William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First question's on the 50-basis-point Durbin impact on the internal revenue growth for '12. Would that impact the margins as well?","Jeffery Yabuki","There is going to be a slight impact to that but it should not be substantial.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then the 4% to 8% internal revenue growth target you guys laid out for over a 3-year period. So if you're looking at 2011 to 2013, would you still expect to be able to hit that even with the 50-basis point Durbin impact? Or maybe can just talk about confidence around that at this at this juncture.","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. Again, our theory is that guidance, and thank you, Chris, for its noting that it's in any 3-year period. We have no reason to believe that, right now, that our guidance has changed. So we're not -- let me be clear, because Tom is getting quite nervous. We are not giving guidance for 2013 at this juncture. But we believe our revenue is stepping up. It began stepping up. We went from minus 1 to 1 to 3. This year, we gave guidance that is 3 to 4.5 on an organic basis. And we would expect to continue to see that to be a continuing step function in our growth rate.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on ZashPay, Jeff. Any new details you can provide there in terms of what the revenue model is going to look like for Fiserv? And maybe how most banks are charging for it today? And then I guess, the other question would just be what are the plans for the ZashPay and Popmoney brands? I guess, are you considering consolidating the 2?","Jeffery Yabuki","So there's a lot of questions in there. So most banks are not charging right now. There are a few pieces of functionality that the banks that will be in the product in the second quarter that will, I think, change that. There are some areas like funding transactions to or from prepaid, things like that, where there are some revenue opportunities. We have ZashPay.com where we're charging for transactions and so we're seeing growth there. What I'd like to do -- and we are obviously looking at what is the best way for us to be in the market from both a branding and technology perspective. Those -- we anticipate those decisions to be made in the quarter, in the first quarter. And we're also going to start communicating transaction growth information in 2012. So when we release first quarter, we'll actually have a lot more color on this.","Operator","Greg Smith, Sterne Agee.","Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","The first question, the heightened expenses or the incremental expenses due to the profit-sharing, is that in the corporate or is that blended in the segments?","Thomas J. Hirsch","We have it blended across the segments, so we allocate that back. So it impacted margins in each piece of that.","Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then Tom, is there anything in the guidance for buybacks?","Thomas J. Hirsch","We -- clearly, we do, right? We clearly have a -- we have a lot of different scenarios that we run from a capital allocation standpoint and we're going to allocate our capital. This year, if you looked back at 2011, we allocated some to a strategic acquisition and the rest is share repurchase. As Jeff indicated, we're going to continue down that strategy and we're going to be very disciplined with our capital deployment. But clearly, we have some capital deployment scenarios incorporated into our guidance.","Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, do you expect sort of over the next few years for free cash flow to sustainably be above adjusted EPS? It seems like it has been, but there's always a few puts and takes in any given year. But should we expect that to continue over the next few years?","Thomas J. Hirsch","I think you're going to see that. I think it's going to track clearly net income from that standpoint over the long haul. And I think as you continue to see us, and that\u2019s the cause here and clearly Q4, I mean, we just have a large revenue acceleration. And so as we continue to get back on the accelerated growth track that we're on, we're going to be building working capital a little bit in receivables as we get to that next tier level. But clearly, over the long term, we expect that to be around net income growth and our CapEx is a little bit higher because of the data center thing that we have in the current year also.","Operator","John Kraft, D.A. Davidson.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I just wanted to drill down a bit on the number of ACCEL\/Exchange deals signed. I realize that most of your clients are below the $10 billion mark. But I guess that's I assume that in preparation of the April exclusivity date that maybe you'd see a spike there. Is it just too early?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, we -- as you know well, John, right, the institutions are making decisions. And yes, the substantial majority of our debit business is below the $10 billion threshold. But we did, as we talked about at Investor Day, we did end up signing incremental clients on to ACCEL\/Exchange as a second network. And so we do expect to begin to see volume coming from that. But largely, we think that will come. I mean,  some of these are still contracts in process. We don't think that will show up really in a measurable way until the end of the first quarter or even perhaps into the second quarter. But clearly, we secured some incremental clients from this, from the legislation.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay, good to know. And then just one housekeeping for Tom. Any material termination fees in the quarter?","Thomas J. Hirsch","No, we have, for the year, we had about $26 million of termination fees compared to $22 million last year. It was a little bit higher in the quarter which is what we anticipated, roughly $10 million in the fourth quarter compared to $4 million in the quarter, fourth quarter last year.","Operator","And our last question today will be from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I just wanted to follow up and dig in on a couple. On the Financial segment, the 6%, I mean, that's an impressive number. So how much -- is that pretty much -- I heard the term fee was about $6 million higher but that's pretty much all license sales? And I guess, Tom, is there a year-over-year growth rate you can give me on license sales for that fourth quarter to account for that big growth rate of 6%?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I mean I think overall, Brian, our license sales are up not 10% but approximately in that general direction. And our license fees are up about $15 million. And that we also have some other onetime fees in there for account upgrades and those sorts of things that happened in the fourth quarter, and also some services that we delivered to clients in that particular quarter also. So overall, it's -- the license fee component was a bigger component of that.","Jeffery Yabuki","Hey, Brian, just for clarity, when Tom talks about one-time fees, he's talking about product licenses from clients. He's not talking about that in addition to the license revenue. I just want to make sure we clarify that.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. But it sounds like going forward in the first quarter, because a lot of that growth is probably not going to be there, is it'll step down to a more normal growth rate that we see in financial.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Absolutely. I mean we look at growth rates on a year-over-year basis, right? I mean because you're going to have -- in the fourth quarter, we have a lot of things that fell into that particular quarter.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, we wouldn't expect -- Brian, for clarity, I know you aren't exactly asking but I'll answer it anyway. We do not anticipate that we would have the same growth in Q4 that we're going to have in Q1.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No, I wouldn't expect it but I did want to make sure that was -- we're all thinking about that correctly.","Jeffery Yabuki","Right. We do believe though that just like the company has been stepping up its growth rate, right, that the Financial segment is also stepping up its growth rate. That that's important.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And those license sales, that big increase, what is that in? What area inside of Financial?","Thomas J. Hirsch","It's across the entire client base. One of the things that we have to continue to remember is we have over I think 5,500 core Account Processing relationships. And so we have a number of products that we developed in each of those different platforms. And so we're selling a number of different products into those existing client relationships, and it\u2019s primarily existing customers. So when you think about 5,500 Account Processing relationships, there's just a lot of incremental opportunity to continue to deliver add-on value and that's what a lot of that is. It's really across the entire base.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally for me, it was asked on Durbin Amendment, the 50-basis point, because I just want to make sure I understand it. It sounds like it's coming from the biller side that, that pressure will take place. Is that because you get a direct cut in the interchange or is that because you expect pricing pressure from the biller as a result?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Brian, how I would put it is that we've indicated that, you're right, it is in our Biller business and I'm not going to talk much more about that. The market in this business, as you know, is extremely competitive, and I don't want to get into that much more detail. But clearly, Durbin, given that the lower cost and that's really the impact on our revenue line from that standpoint.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But do you see any impact from Durbin on a negative face -- in a negative way and from the financial institutions or you don't expect anything there?","Thomas J. Hirsch","No, nothing that all, Bryan. This is all related to non-financial institutions.","Jeffery Yabuki","And we wanted to make sure we clarify that because they're very different elements of the Durbin Amendment.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Brian. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to call our Investor Relations group. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"9600":["Fiserv, Inc.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Ma'am, you may begin.","Stephanie Gregor - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. We capped off 2015 with fourth quarter performance that allowed us to exceed the majority of our financial metrics for the year. These strong results were in spite of Q4 revenue that was a bit light versus expectations, driven primarily by delays in EMV card personalization and lower-than-planned license revenue.","Overall, performance in the second half 2015 was solid, including 5% internal revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters. These growth results, combined with record fourth quarter sales, should set the stage to expand our internal revenue growth rate in 2016. The organization achieved an unprecedented 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. In the process, we expanded adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points, grew adjusted operating income by 8%, and broke $1 billion in free cash flow for the first time.","We anticipate strong results again in 2016. We provided internal revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6%, consistent with our strategic objective of stepping up our growth rate an average of 50 basis points to 100 basis points per year. We also expect another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth at least 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and a record level of free cash flow per share.","As you saw on January 20, we announced the acquisition of certain digital banking and payment assets of the Community Financial Services business from ACI Worldwide. These complementary solutions are strategically aligned with our goal of enabling clients to transform their financial services experience.","In addition to technology solutions, we will also welcome a group of high-quality clients and committed associates. We expect this transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, to close towards the end of the first quarter. We estimate the purchase price, including the tax benefits and run rate synergies, to be right around 5 times EBITDA. We will supply additional financial information after the transaction closes.","At the beginning of the year, we established three key priorities to help you assess our performance which were: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients.","Reported internal revenue growth of 4% for the year were short of our guidance, as we could not overcome the revenue delay, resulting from the unanticipated impact of the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization we mentioned in Q3. But for that negative impact, internal revenue growth for the full year would have been 5%.","We saw a good growth across many of our recurring revenue businesses such as Card Services, Biller Solutions, Digital Channels, and Account Processing. Importantly, we continue to build our capabilities to steadily accelerate our internal revenue growth rate into the future. These areas of high-quality revenue growth, combined with our focus on operational efficiency, drove strong adjusted operating income growth of 8% and 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion.","Full-year adjusted earnings per share grew 15%, which was $0.04 above the top end of our original guidance, and we achieved a record $4.23 in free cash flow per share. We again demonstrated the strength of our business model and like our trajectory going into 2016.","Our second priority was to build an extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions.","January marked the three-year anniversary of the Open Solutions acquisition. By any measure, this transaction has been successful, adding a modern innovative account processing technology solution, talented associates and a passionate client base. To-date, we have signed 75 DNA clients and delivered substantial value to the existing client base through high-quality add-on solutions.","For the year, 28 new DNA clients went live, including 9 financial institutions with assets greater than $1 billion. And of the nine, six went live in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that these recent implementations, along with the planned 2016 activity, will progressively increase revenue throughout this year.","We added a number of privileged client relationships across multiple account processing platforms in the quarter. For example, United Nations Federal Credit Union, the 28th largest credit union in the U.S. with approximately $4.3 billion in assets, selected DNA along with a suite of integrated solutions to service more than 115,000 members located in 200 nations and territories around the world.","Suffolk County National Bank with assets nearing $2 billion selected the Premier account processing platform, along with a full suite of payment and channel solutions including Retail and Business Online, Mobiliti, Bill Payment, Popmoney, and Source Capture. By selecting Fiserv as a single provider of these services, these clients expect to amplify their technology, streamline operations and enhance their clients' experience.","In addition to new clients, we remain focused on deepening existing relationships with an emphasis on our payments and channel solutions. Our integrated debit and credit value propositions continue to resonate well. And in fact, we added nearly 50 new debit clients in the fourth quarter alone. For the full year, we contracted to add more than 700 payment solutions across Card Services, bill payment and Popmoney.","In addition, we've signed more than 260 institutions for our new CardValet solution which provides value at the intersection of mobile experience and card payments. We added 43%, more than 1.2 million subscribers, to end the year with over 4 million users on Mobiliti ASP.","We have several important Mobiliti releases queued up this year which should enhance functionality and extend user engagement. We also continue to gain momentum with Mobiliti Business. This solution in its inaugural year added 60 clients in the quarter, and we now have more than 100 businesses live with thousands of underlying users.","Our third priority in 2015 was to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients. At our Investor Conference in June, we highlighted six of our innovation base solutions \u2013 Agiliti, Mobiliti, DNA, EMV, NOW and IPS \u2013 that together form an important part of our internal revenue growth acceleration story. We exited the year with our thesis intact and continue to expect sequential growth rate increases in the 2016 to 2019 period.","During the year, we expanded the breadth of our Popmoney network through business disbursements and charitable giving. During the quarter, we signed a payment agreement with CARE, one of the leading humanitarian organizations in the world to accept donations using Popmoney. Through this relationship, millions of consumers will now have the option to use Popmoney to make the world a better place one payment at a time.","One of our newest in market innovations, Immediate Funds, gained important traction in the quarter. This solution enables financial institutions the option of providing consumers real-time access to deposited funds across the channel of their choice. Even after signing our first top 10 bank to Immediate Funds in the quarter, the pipeline remains strong for this real-time right-now solution.","Client focus on EMV remains heightened and activity levels are increasing. Car manufacturing accelerated again this quarter, and backlog is building. We have much better line of sight into EMV manufacturing and personalization activity going into 2016. Accordingly, we expect strong EMV growth with volume nearing our expected peaks in the middle quarters of the year.","We signed our second client to Agiliti, our UK cloud-based account processing solution in the fourth quarter. Camden Bank, a de novo institution, selected Agiliti, paired with our Mobiliti solution to bring its unique digital banking experience to the market later this year.","In January, Cornerstone Mutual Services signed with Agiliti as the banking platform for the UK Credit Union Expansion Project with plans to initially migrate up to 40 UK credit unions in 2016. Our Agiliti pipeline remains strong as we head into the year.","Finally, we closed a very small Biller Solutions acquisition in January, buying Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Convenience Pay Services business. This expands our biller footprint through a modern SaaS platform, enabling electronic payment acceptance for a broad range of billers. We anticipate the business will generate roughly one half of 1% of total revenue and that the synergy adjusted net purchase price multiple will be around 3 times EBITDA.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 5% to $1.3 billion and increased 4% to $4.9 billion for the year. The internal revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and up 4% for the full year, including 180 basis points respectively of combined negative impact from FX and the unanticipated EMV card personalization delays.","Our full-year internal revenue growth rate would have been 5%, excluding the unanticipated impact of these items. Our revenue for the year is a tale of two cities, as our processing and services recurring revenue increased 5% even after the negative currency impact. On the other hand, product revenue was short of plan for the year and declined compared to 2014, due primarily to lower-than-anticipated base and EMV revenue in our Output Solutions business and lower-than-planned license revenue for the year.","We continue to build high-quality recurring revenue which is key to our long-term growth profile. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 12% over the prior year to $1. Full-year adjusted earnings per share exceeded the top end of our original guidance range growing 15% to $3.87. Full-year adjusted operating margin performance was up a very strong 120 basis points to 31.7%, driven by high-quality revenue growth, expense discipline and a continued focus on operational effectiveness.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter increased 10 basis points to 30.7% with comparisons negatively impacted by the timing of our Fall Client Conference, revenue mix and higher expenses in our corporate segment which, by itself, negatively impacted margin by 50 basis points in the quarter.","At the segment level, our Payments businesses delivered 6% internal revenue growth in the quarter and 5% for the full year. Growth was primarily led by our Card Services, Biller and Channels businesses. Our Output Solutions business saw a base business momentum in the fourth quarter, and EMV demand was strong as we had anticipated.","A longer lag between manufacturing and personalization of EMV cards led to an additional $7 million revenue deferral in the quarter on top of the $9 million in the third quarter. Our clients purchased a large amount of manufactured EMV card product in 2015 which has not yet been rolled out to their customers. Given visibility and demand, we anticipate that EMV revenue will accelerate substantially into 2016, as our clients move forward with the final card personalization and distribute the EMV cards to consumers.","We again leveraged the power of our integrated card value proposition and finished the year with a very strong sales quarter, signing 49 new debit clients and a total of nearly 150 for the year. Debit transactions continued to grow above market with high-single-digit growth for the year.","Our industry-leading bill payment and person-to-person payment solutions continued to grow. For the year, bill payment transactions grew in the low-single digits, and Popmoney transactions were up over 20%. In Q4, we delivered the first release supporting our Integrated Payment Strategy or IPS, which forms a new integrated bill payment, P2P, and transfer experience. The early returns are encouraging as we expect further growth in these payment transactions in 2016 and over the next several years.","As Jeff mentioned, Mobiliti ASP users were up sharply year-over-year, gaining over 40% and crossing the 4 million subscriber threshold. We continue to believe digital transformation is forging a long runway for revenue growth in both digital subscribers and transactional services.","Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter to $224 million and for the year was up 9% to $840 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 150 basis points in the quarter to 33.6% and was up 130 basis points to 33% for the year. This strong performance was driven by high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency, even as we continue to invest in targeted innovation.","Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $631 million in the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year. This solid performance, which includes a negative currency impact of 60 basis points in the quarter and 70 basis points for the year, was led by our Account Processing and Lending businesses.","Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $195 million in the quarter and $826 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was pressured by the timing of expenses including our Fall Client Conference and business mix in the quarter. Full year adjusted operating margin was excellent, up 120 basis points, driven by growth in our scale businesses such as Account Processing and the benefit of our operational effectiveness initiatives.","Corporate segment net adjusted operating performance in the quarter was in line sequentially but up over the prior year, primarily due to the timing of expenses and an increase in certain consulting expenses. This year-over-year increase in expense reduced overall company operating margin in the quarter by 50 basis points.","Our effective adjusted tax rate was 34.6% in both the quarter and year. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was slightly lower than expected due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit, offset by the timing of other discrete tax items. Our effective adjusted tax rate was up 60 basis points for the full year due to lower discrete tax benefits in 2015 than the prior year, which equates to about a 1% or $0.04 per share negative impact on this year's adjusted EPS growth rate. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 35% in 2016.","We generated over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2015, free cash flow per share increased 11% to $4.23, 9% higher than our adjusted EPS of $3.87. We believe the combined benefits of focusing on high-quality revenue along with disciplined capital allocation will continue to produce excellent free cash flow per share results.","We received $36 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2015 which are substantially excluded from our free cash flow results. In January, we received an additional $140 million distribution related to the sale of an underlying business. Since the formation of the venture in 2008, we have received, including the proceeds from the original sale of our 51% interest, over $1 billion of gross distributions. The joint venture has fairly limited assets remaining given the success to-date.","Total debt at year-end was up about $500 million since the beginning of the year to $4.3 billion but is still only 2.3 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio.","We repurchased 4.5 million shares of stock in the quarter for $422 million. For the year, we repurchased over 17 million shares at an average cost of less than $85 per share, returning nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders. We announced the new 15 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter and at year-end had 17.4 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom. Strong sales in the quarter led to a 3% increase in TCV over the last year's record level. In addition to the wins mentioned earlier, we had excellent results across most of our businesses in the quarter. Full-year sales were short of expectations primarily due to a reduction in the number of larger in-year new client sales closed compared to the last several years which we expect will reverse in 2016. Pipeline trends are strong, including a more typical number of larger transactions which should bode well for a faster start this year.","Integrated sales were outstanding at nearly $90 million in the quarter and $257 million for the full year. Standouts included card services, bill payment, mobility and custom statements. We achieved operational effectiveness savings of $64 million in 2015, well above our goal of $50 million. Savings this year were driven primarily by strong results in procurement and workforce optimization.","After the successful completion of our Atlanta facility consolidation in 2015, we will further progress our real estate and data center initiatives this year. You will also recall from our Investor Day that 2016 kicks off our new five-year $250 million operational effectiveness program. Our operational effectiveness target for 2016 is $40 million.","One of the bigger stories in the environment last year was increasing FI M&A activity which we expect will continue. We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade is good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across technology landscape.","There is no question that digital and specifically mobile is having a dramatic impact on the banking experience. Branches are in decline, and the payment world is more dynamic than ever which we believe will lead to meaningful opportunity.","Financial institutions are increasingly looking at technology providers to help them navigate these changing times. We believe the trends in the market align well with our innovation-based agenda and should drive further growth over the next several years.","With that, let's move to 2016. Our three key enterprise priorities which remain generally unchanged are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.","For 2016, we expect internal revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 6%. Our roadmap for revenue acceleration includes continued growth in our scaled high-quality revenue businesses, incremental contributions from our innovation-based solutions and less negative impact from both currency and the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization. As high-quality revenue comes on slowly, we again expect the higher growth rate in the second half of the year and that will likely build sequentially.","We expect adjusted earnings per share to grow in a range of 12% to 15% or $4.32 to $4.44 for the year. We also expect adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points and that free cash flow per share will be greater than $4.70 for the year. Lastly for guidance purposes, we do not expect the ACI asset acquisition to have a material impact on our operating results this year.","On balance, we performed well in 2015 and showcase the power of our business model. Although we fell a bit short on reported revenue, we achieved our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, drove exceptional operating margin and delivered another year of strong free cash flow.","We also added meaningful new innovation to our solution portfolio and are well positioned for the foreseeable future. Our results are a product of the commitment and dedication of our 21,000 associates around the world who strive to be their best. I'm grateful to be part of a company that delivers today while creating an even brighter tomorrow.","Lastly, as we shared with you in Q3, we expect this to be Tom's final earnings call as our CFO, and we thank him for the many contributions he has made to support the success of our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. On the selection front, we have been very pleased with the significant interest in this important role and are on track to have a successor named and in place this quarter.","With that Laura, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session Our first question is coming from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is now open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, Jeff and Tom.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, David.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Good morning.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Congratulations on the strong free cash flow growth. Nice to go out on a high note, Tom.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Absolutely, David","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","So, just moving into some of the target, you're 2016 operational effectiveness target of $40 million is less than what it was in 2015. What are the drivers behind that?","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","I think David, we're in the first part of our new program. And so, there's a number of different items. So we anticipate that this is going to accelerate on a year-over-year basis. We feel highly confident in that number. We are doing a lot of things, as Jeff indicated in the script, around our real estate and data center consolidation. And most of those impacts, we're doing a lot of the consolidation activities around our data center optimization efforts in 2016 which is not going to have the full run rate benefit until largely 2017 and 2018. And so, that's probably the biggest drive in that case, because it's a little bit different than the benefits we had in 2015, which we're focused a lot on procurement. So those benefits are going to scale up as we go through the next few years, along with \u2013 continued on the workforce optimization side, but that's really the biggest issue there.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. And then what is the 2016 sales target?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","David, in terms of gross numbers or...","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, in terms of total new bookings. You mentioned you fell a little short for 2015.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We fell a little short. We typically don't supply that number, the actual number, but we do expect to have higher sales growth in 2016 versus 2015, and that will be reflected in our quota for the year.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Okay. And then just one question on your acquisition of the ACI Worldwide digital assets. How should we think about the $50 million tax benefit? Over what period of \u2013 number of years is that recognized? And is that an income statement item or just a cash flow item?","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","It's just a cash flow item, David. So that's the discounted value or the net present value of those tax benefits over a 15-year period.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. So, the $50 million is the NPV, David. So actually, the gross number would be meaningfully larger, but that is the NPV.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. And then, Tom, final time, what was the December 31 share count?","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","I actually had that written down on my piece of paper here, David. So, we had roughly $225.3 million at the end of December. And at the end of January, we bought back about another 2 million shares in the month of January.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Thanks so much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. I was wondering if you could help us understand the dynamic with your clients in terms of them having manufacture cards and then sort of delaying the personalization. Is it just a question of they're not turning over their cardholder base in terms of reissuing cards as fast as they had intended, or what's the dynamic there that is sort of causing the delay? It seems like they're putting one foot in the water but not the other.","Mark A. Ernst - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","This is Mark Ernst. Let me that real quick. Fundamentally, what we're seeing happen with clients is that they were kind of working on their own internal schedules to get EMV cards ready and out the door. And we just sort of had a bit of a delay and how many of those were finally issued to their consumers. And some of that is a system's readiness issue and some of that was kind of just the timing with which they wanted to go through the reissue process.","But because of the concerns that have been out there in the industry about the availability of chips, we saw a lot of people pushing for the manufacturing to get done and put that into their inventory in anticipation of needing to get the reissues done. So I think it's a combination of both a lot of internal process, differences by client but very importantly, concern over not coming up short on EMV chip availability.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. It has been a longer lag, Ramsey. We anticipated that we normally see because these clients are actually paying obviously for all those product and taking title to the cards also. So, it has been, to Mark's point \u2013 for us, it's been very surprising this year that we'd see that. But obviously over time, these cards are going to get issued over the next year and two. And that cycle is going to dramatically reduce, we believe, because they're going to be issuing these cards to their consumers.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That was my next question, and this is probably a rather obvious question. But there's no risk that the deferred revenue never gets implemented, right? This is sort of like money in the bank in the sense that these plastics will get reissued. It's not like that deferred revenue would need to be adjusted at some point. It's sort of just a matter of when rather than if.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","That's correct because they paid us for these, right? We received the cash and deferred revenue. And so, it's going to get recognized when those cards are ultimately shipped to the end consumer, and that's going to happen, right? So it's just a matter of timing. And as I think Jeff indicated on his prepared remarks, we look at 2016 right now, we see at least initially the middle part of the year to be when a lot of personalization is going to occur, but we continue to watch it closely. But those cards are definitely going to get issued over the next two years here.","Mark A. Ernst - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I think even if they weren't issued for some bizarre reason, they've already \u2013 the titles were already transferred. So there is no risk of not recognizing that revenue.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And the chips actually have a finite life. So...","Mark A. Ernst - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, right.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ramsey, to your point, it's a little bit of an odyssey. I also think the community \u2013 primarily, this is a community bank issues. The community banks are making decisions on the timing of their should they do a mass reissues, should they do partial reissues. There are a lot of factors. So you saw the FI landscape kind of ignore the issue. And then all of a sudden, it became very urgent, and then they bought them, and then they had to think about what's the best way to get them distributed.","The other thing to keep in mind is the cards don't have the same level of value if the merchants aren't live on their end. And so, we are just really seeing and you're probably \u2013 we're all seeing it every once in a while now. Finally, a merchant says, all right, we have to put your card in the machine. So that landscape is coming together, and the end-to-end equation is being built. We expect that will continue to build and that will match up well with the institutions deciding to send the cards out to their consumers and get them finally personalized.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Got it, okay. And last one for Tom, fittingly. The higher expenses in the Corporate segment this time around and that was really all \u2013 can you give us a little color on that? That was all basically \u2013 that was relatively transient and should correct going forward.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","That's correct. We have a little timing. If you look at \u2013 we had about the same level of expenses as we had in the previous three quarters this year. We just had a very \u2013 last year's fourth quarter was very, very low. So we had some one-time items there that were more of a benefit, and you're going to see us around \u2013 we had about $100 million for the full year for the Corporate and Other segment, and that should be pretty much where it's at for the next \u2013 in 2016.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Okay, fantastic. Well, thanks so much.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Koning from Baird. Sir, your line is now open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Great job again this year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Hey, David.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And I guess, first of all, it sounds like \u2013 well, I mean, with the acquisitions, I guess it sounds like not overly material, but are they in the EPS guidance right now?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, as we talked about, we had two acquisitions. We had a small biller acquisition, a very, very small biller acquisition and so that is in our guidance. We believe ACI, the numbers are in our guidance as well. Because of when it will close and how it's going to come on, we think it's going to be fairly immaterial to our numbers.","When it closes in the next quarter that we'll report, we'll give some more insights into that. We also think that the majority of the synergies in this deal will be, it'll take \u2013 we have to transition the solutions over. These are recurring revenue kinds of solutions that have to move into our data centers and things like that. So it probably \u2013 we won't see the benefit of the synergies likely until 2017, and that's important when we think about how the earnings will effectively come on.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, great. That makes sense. And then, what were term fees in Q4? And do you expect them to be similar in 2016 as they were in 2015 just given the M&A environment in banks is a little high right now?","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. We don't see really any change with that on a year-over-year basis. They were up just, I think, $1 million or $2 million in the fourth quarter over last year, so about the same, but up slightly, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Well, that's all I've got. Nice job. Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glen Greene from Oppenheimer & Company. Sir, your line is now open.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good afternoon, Jeff and Tom.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Glenn.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I guess the first question, maybe just a little bit more granularity on the key catalyst to drive the acceleration in the organic growth. I know you've talked about it at a high level. It sounds like it's a combination of less drags from FX and EMV. But maybe more of the positives, how much incremental do you expect from EMV, maybe DNA, Mobiliti, just a little bit of color, the key high-level drivers.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So, Glenn, let me take it, and then Tom and Mark can add in as needed. So when I think about the drivers of a growth acceleration in 2016, you have \u2013 as we laid out at Investor Day, we laid out that we were thinking about our growth in two separate baskets: the momentum-based growth, which is really the mass of the company in our kind of existing business portfolio; and then we had six solutions that we highlighted as representative of areas of innovation-based growth. We actually talked about 12, but we highlighted six.","And so from each of those six areas, Agiliti, DNA, EMV, NOW, Integrated Payments or IPS, and Mobiliti, we see each of those areas contributing some level of incremental growth in 2016. It won't surprise you to know that we're not going to talk about it specifically. But on an order of magnitude basis, we did lay out at Investor Day how we saw the ramp coming year-over-year. And so we expect some incremental benefit in 2016, even more in 2017, even more in 2018. So we have a high degree of confidence and visibility that that's going to happen. So that's point one.","Point two is we expect to have a little less drag from FX. We expect to not be surprised by this lag between EMV card manufacturing and EMV card personalization. So we think that will turn as well. So when you add all those up, it gives us a pretty good degree of confidence and frankly a good degree of visibility into how we get from 2015 into 2016 which we believe will act as a step to 2017.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Next question on the ACI assets, just to make sure I'm thinking about it right because I think you suggested 5 times EBITDA, including synergies. And I assume that's including the tax benefit also. So is it implying sort of run rate $30 million EBITDA once you've got the synergies fully borne?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Listen, that math, even I can do. So I would say that's probably a reasonable way to think about it, yes.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then the revenue contribution and how you're going to finance it?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I believe we said it's between 1% and 2% of our revenues. And again, we want to wait and see. Number one, we don't have a good sense but have a perfect sense, at least. We have a good sense but not a perfect sense for when it's going to close and therefore how much revenue we're going to bring in this year which is why we're giving the range. But it's in that range. So on a full-year basis, it's in that range. And then we finance it off of our revolver.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just remind me one more on the growth driver, where are you in terms of the big account and bill pay conversions that you sort of had in your pipeline? What's concluded at this point and what's still to come in 2016?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All of the large bill pay wins that we had been talking about before are now on. They're all completed. Now that I'd said that, there may be a small portion of one of the institutions which is a multi-charter institution, but they're substantially onboard at this point.","Now, remember that one of the things that we're doing \u2013 and Tom referenced it in his remarks, is through our Integrated Payment Strategy which is a new experience that brings bill pay transfer and P2P together, effectively, that's introducing a new experience to all the more than $24 million bill pay users. And we think that's actually, Tom referenced, the early returns are positive. We're seeing a very nice acceptance and therefore utilization of this new experience which will be chunked out basically over the next 12 months to 18 months.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","And I think your question on the account processing side, Glenn, just to add to that, I think we've seen some \u2013 we had a number of larger institutions go live in the fourth quarter on our DNA solution, and one large client in particular also converted. And so what those are going to be, bringing on more revenue as we go into 2016 and 2017 clearly because of the surround impact and as those kind of roll in. But we had a good conversion quarter in the fourth quarter.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we still have a fairly large backlog of DNA conversions moving forward.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan Securities. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions, I guess, first on the license sale. Why did you say that was below plan again? Was that cyclical or something more...","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We had some timing with that, and it just wasn't the strongest. We had a few deals in both our international, our channels area that we just didn't hit on in the fourth quarter that kind of pushed off into 2016. And it's not a large number for us, as you know, because the license revenue is fairly small. But a couple of those deals were just a little short on the license and in the current year.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then just on the large deals coming back, that's nice to hear. We've heard that with some other players as well. What kind of projects are you seeing? Is it more on the Account Processing or Integrated or DNA front? Just any context will be great.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it is. Actually, it's a pretty broad swap of larger deals. I would say that we have them in the Account Processing space, Output Solutions, Biller Solutions, some actually good-sized deals in the card world. I mean we actually \u2013 I think a bit of an absence of them or of the same number in 2015, a lot of pipeline work got done, and so it's fairly broad. It's not in just a single area. It's probably in four or five areas.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So to the extent that some of these closed early on in the year, could they convert to revenues in 2016, and is that assumed?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, yes, some of them could. Large deals typically take 12 months to 18 months to convert, so some of them could. And I would say that our guidance assumes that we have normal conversion cycles.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, great. Thanks. And Tom, all the best to you again.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Okay, thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, Jeff, Tom and Mark. Jeff, just out of curiosity, the conversation you've had with banks, any thoughts about spending as they look into 2016? I know we hear a lot about energy and maybe the exposure isn't as great for your clients. But just thought how they're thinking about spending for 2016.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, I mean clearly, there are some institutions that are being hit on the energy\/oil issue. So that is having some impact, but I would call that relatively narrow. The majority of the banking industry seems to be at or slightly above in their \"budget\" for what they're going to spend on technology. And there's a lot of energy on mobile and on lending. Lending, there's a lot of noise in the market on alternative lenders, and so you've got a lot of focus on how to think about a new lending experience that starts to merge mobile with data, real-time speed, those kinds of assets and attributes. So you've got that going on.","And you've got a fair amount of thought around branch transformation, and so all of that leads to good healthy conversations. We'll see how it ends up at the end of the year, but banks were pretty bullish going into this year. I think the current level of turmoil, it is a little bit of a wait-and-see market turmoil but on balance. I think we're at least at the level that we would have seen for last year with the bias up.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And then just finally, you've talked a lot about EMV, and I understand just the basic opportunity you have to reissue cards with. As you've learned more about EMV, any other opportunities that you're seeing that maybe medium term or long term could generate additional revenue for you?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know if I would say that I see additional opportunities directly related to the EMV card itself. I do see that there is a tremendous amount of activity in the payment space overall. And so, there's a lot of \u2013 that war at point-of-sale continues to be quite interesting and frankly just so much energy around real-time non-point-of-sale payments. So, the hypes of payment discussions are becoming very different. But exclusive to EMV, I don't know.","Mark A. Ernst - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","The only thing that really comes to mind is that we're obviously deeply involved in a lot of conversations about how tokenization, of all different types of payments, could be affected. And I'd say that's an adjunct to what's happening with EMV. But it...","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And so, Mark, do you need to acquire any assets or technology, or do you think where you are is good enough right now for you to take advantage of some of those?","Mark A. Ernst - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm not sure there's a lot you would acquire per se in that space to more about how you would set up your operations to provide tokenized services, so we're looking at all that.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.","James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I was wondering if you could maybe start off on the infill targets for DNA in 2016. I don't think you, maybe, provided that in your prepared script, so I think it was 30% in 2015 and you did 28%. Could you maybe share with us what it looks like for this year?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jim, I don't actually have that number off the top of my head. We'll do some work to get back to you, and then we'll make sure that we talk about it more broadly. But it likely would not be 28% this year. It'll be a little bit lower than that. And then of course, we'll have the benefit of all of the conversions that we moved in in 2015 will annualize in 2016.","James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just a clarification, I just want to make sure that I fully understand. On the ACI contribution for this year, it sounds like, by the time you get it closed, it's a little bit over a point contribution. And I just want to make sure that I heard you right that that is included in the 5% to 6% full-year revenue growth guidance?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. The 5% to 6% is internal revenue only, not acquired revenue. So all acquired revenue is excluded from that calculation. Total adjusted revenue would be higher when you include the revenue. We were only \u2013 I was only talking about the impact to our adjusted EPS.","James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I understand. And then one final one. Just in terms of the margin expansion potential, you obviously delivered very strong expansion this year, and you're guiding to a little over 50 bps for 2016. Beyond the programmatic cost savings impact that you outlined of the $40 million, are there other mix related or other benefits that can potentially drive upside to that 50 bps of expansion?","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. I think, we're obviously, Jim, coming off a very strong year where we delivered 120 basis points of margin expansion. And while the key things has been the driving of the quality revenue that we have, if you look at our Payments-related segment, the Payments segment margins were up nicely, and that is a function of that high-quality revenue. Clearly, we gave guidance in 2015 of greater than 50 basis points.","I'm not saying we're going to outperform by that extent, but our guidance is greater than 50 basis points in 2016. And our business model is functioning well and we're going to continue to push those levers. And I think I'm most pleased by is the opportunity we have over the next years to continue to drive that high-quality revenue and scale along with this additional $250 million of operational effectiveness savings that we have good visibility into over the next several years.","James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And good luck, Tom.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jim.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. I may have missed this, but did you give a sense into the growth by segment between the Payments, Financial in terms of that's embedded in your guidance for the year?","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","No, we did not. We don't give segment guidance. But you can clearly tell, Darrin, the Payments segment, just given the fact that EMV and IPS and a few other things that we talked about there are big drivers of kind of growth that that's going to continue to be higher than our Financial segment.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I just wanted to now hone in for a moment on the competitive dynamics around the real-time solutions, you guys have clearly been doing well on, whether it's your DNA or other platforms. But I mean it feels like there's been a lot of demand in the market for that, and you have the right solutions for that. Can you just comment on how much demand there is going into 2016 around that specific offering capability on core account and what the competitive dynamic is out there for similar offerings, again more for the real-time solutions?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. And Darrin, you're really talking about on the Account Processing side, not on the Payments side, is that right?","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's exactly right, yes.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So there's a lot of talk around real-time core systems, and there is a lot of looking going on \u2013 or it's not a lot, not a relative numbers, but a lot on a relative basis to what we've seen historically for larger institutions looking at what would it take to convert real time. There's a couple of larger mid-tiers that are in the process of doing conversions right now. And so, there is focus out there.","We see some of the more progressive institutions in the $1 billion to $10 billion space taking a look at that, but we haven't seen \u2013 beyond DNA, we've not seen a lot of movement in the market. And frankly, as I sit here today and I think about the larger transactions that have been done over the last three years or four years, I can't think of \u2013 I honestly cannot think of a real-time solution that we did not win that went to anyone else. And so, I only raise that because the other solutions that are being chosen are not real time.","So, that means \u2013 that may mean that the real time, it's still early, or it may mean that our solution on a real-time basis is one of the better solutions in the market. It's probably a little bit of both. So, I think it's still very early in that genesis. Remember that on the credit union side of the community base, institution space, they're all real time.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the old thrifts are real-time. So you really have what the core banking world as the focus for real-time, and I think we'll continue to see that over the next three years to five years, but we're early.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Just last question from me. I appreciate it. But have you guys expressed any interest or do you find yourselves at all interested of growing into the much, much larger global FIs in the world that we've seen some of your competitors trying to do on that note? I mean you mentioned talking about international acquisitions down the road at some point. Any update on that front in terms of appetite now?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So the short answer is no.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But we do \u2013 but after I said that, we do provide channel services, so our Corillian solution and our Mobiliti solution, and some of the larger banks in the world whether it's ANZ or Bank of Ireland or Westpac. A number of clients today were doing nichey solutions. We are not in the business of doing large global banks on the core system side. We are not in the business of doing services to large global banks unless they support one of our license technologies. We have risk solutions in a number of, again, nichey solutions, but we're not going into that large services and license space.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's very helpful, guys. Thanks again.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Sir, your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good afternoon.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good afternoon.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Pardon me. Thanks for taking the question. Recognizing that we're only talking about 100 basis points or so of revenue growth from EMV, to the extent that we see a ramp in 2016 in the middle quarters and then extensibly sort of the rat moves through the snake, as we think about 2017, do you have enough line of sight to say that 2016 isn't sort of a bulge year for revenue growth? Can we expect over time recognizing that guiding to 2017 today? But can we expect over time, all else being equal, sort of a gradual improvement in organic revenue growth, or are we going to be talking about difficult comps against the midpoint of 2016 when we get out a year from now?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, let me try to answer this and make sure that we've got it answered, and Tom and Mark will help as needed. So, you'll remember, when we laid this out at our Investor Day in June \u2013 excuse me, we laid out kind of a year-by-year view and that there would be two sources of revenue that we thought we would benefit from. We thought we would benefit from the EMV card issuance itself which is both the manufacturing and the personalization. And we believe that we would also benefit as cards got into force and we were processing those debit or credit transactions that we would have a small lift on our processing revenue, and that over time that piece especially would build.","We also anticipated that EMV would primarily happen between 2015 and 2017, and we're not coming off that view at this stage. I want to \u2013 sorry, and then when we get to full boat, because these cards expire like every other cards expire, that we will get into a very natural reissue cycle as we've always been in. And so while there may be a slight hump in a quarter or in quarters that we don't see that to be having a material impact on our comps moving forward.","Now, if every single institution decides to issue in the middle of Q3 in 2016, that could create a problem, we don't see that happening. I think it's highly unlikely, and I don't think anyone could actually make that happen from a manufacturing and personalization perspective. That's a long-winded way of saying we can't predict the future, I can't tell you what's going to happen on quarterly comps for sure. But on a year-by-year basis, I feel like once we get into 2017 that we're going to definitely see that smoothing that we laid out at Investor Day. And if you go back and take a look at that, I think that's probably the way that lays out.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. I think the other thing \u2013 and then, Mark, I know you have a comment too. I think, Andrew, remember our build is to grow 50 basis points to 100 basis points on an annual basis. And at Investor Day, you could see we have a number of different moving parts there. As we look out, I think, longer \u2013 and Jeff just really hit on the EMV side of this. But you look at different things like IPS or you look at things like Agiliti, or you look at things like the NOW Network, those are factored in over those longer period cycles which is 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, because we're really trying to build this base of 50 basis points to 100 basis points on average each year. And so, Mark, I don't know if you want to add to that.","Mark A. Ernst - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","The only other thing I was going to say about EMV is \u2013 and Jeff and Tom have it right that we will see the bigger uplift now in 2016 over 2015. And then it starts to flatten out because we don't get the ramp, but we do have the continued level of reissue as Jeff pointed out. The only other thing that we talked about at Investor Day was the potential in the event that prepaid becomes a card type that adopts EMV. That continues to be a big opportunity for us. But so far, we're not seeing anything in the market that would suggest that that's likely to happen soon.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. All right. That helps me out. Thank you. And then, Tom, again, kudos to you in the job you've done. We'll miss working with you. You've done a particularly good job in the last couple years of improving working capital which is exceptional, I think, for a processor. It's not something we often think about. How much working cap opportunity is there left in terms of being additive to core free cash flow from operations?","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","I think we've gone pretty far with that. I think our business model though will continue to stay very honed in on that. What I mean by that, you're not going to see a lot of receivable growth in this company because of how the high-quality revenues are going to turn the cash flow. So we've done a very good job at optimizing that, so I don't think there is a lot there.","There are always a lot of different things as we talk about, whether they be tax benefits or acquisitions, whether it continues to be on the CapEx side which again you saw higher levels this year because of our Alpharetta-type deal. That's going to come back down to normal next year. And so I don't think anything really changing from that standpoint.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Wonderful. Thank you.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Katri from Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is now open.","Moshe Katri - CRT Capital Group LLC","Hi. I appreciate the color on the big picture and the feedback from some of the FI clients. Obviously, we're about a month into the first quarter of the calendar year. Is there anything that kind of makes you worried about the possibility of budget slippages or any sort of pullback in spending, given the macro environment? Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I wish I had a fully reliable crystal ball for this. I mean I would say that volatility in the market as everyone feel like there's volatility and we just have to continue to watch that. The beauty of the majority of the solutions that we provide is they're not discretionary. And with all of the digital transformation that's occurring in the market today, there's a real need for institutions to invest and to keep up with what's going on.","Consumer expectations are growing so rapidly because of everything that's going on in the retail world and in the non-financial services world that those expectations are requiring institutions to invest. It's very much becoming non-discretionary. And so I continue to believe we're going to see solid growth in those kinds of solutions in 2016 and into the foreseeable future.","Moshe Katri - CRT Capital Group LLC","And then if you look at your revenue base, is there a way to quantify which part of the revenues are generated from what we call discretionary and non-discretionary? So can we assume that maybe 80%, 90% of your business is kind of recurring and kind of critical for the day-to-day operation of your typical FI?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, I don't know that there's much that we do that's not important to the FI. I mean, we have very small businesses that are data-oriented businesses, which I guess you could argue are not necessarily \u2013 that are not necessarily mission-critical. But even the things that we sell that are quote, discretionary. It's hard to know \u2013 if you have to upgrade software on a solution that you use to manage risk, that purchase may be discretionary. So you may have some wiggle room. But much of what we do is non-discretionary from that perspective.","I don't think we're ever going to see a whole lot of variability in any year almost regardless of the situation. But clearly, I have the same crystal ball question that everyone else has. We believe that the banking industry right now is in pretty good shape. The rate increases will move through this year, and I think that'll be generally good for banks. I'm talking about not perspective increases but just the December raise, and I think that'll be good. And we'll see how the economy develops. I think that will be the ultimate linchpin for how banks decide to invest over the next year.","Moshe Katri - CRT Capital Group LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Paul Condra from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is now open.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for having me on.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello, Paul.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just a couple of quick ones. Just the $250 million operational effectiveness plan, is that kind of a six-year plan, so that's like $40 million, $50 million a year?","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yes, five years. But yeah, that's exactly right, and it's going to ramp a little bit like I talked about earlier.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then lastly, just to return to EMV one last time, I mean is it possible that this goes on longer than you're expecting that maybe you don't get the surge in mid-2016 that it's just kind of a steady ramp over the next couple of years?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We feel really good about the surge in 2016, primarily because we know what's been manufactured, we know what has not been personalized, we know what has been personalized, we know what's been ordered. So we absolutely have pretty good visibility into what's going to happen in 2016.","We don't have a lot of visibility right now into what's going to happen in 2017, except we will know who has not issued. And remember, you've got in 2017 \u2013 I believe in 2017, you've got one more liability shift that's going to happen. So, we feel really pretty confident about the EMV at the level that we have incorporated into our guidance.","It could go \u2013 I suppose it could go a little bit higher. It could always go a little bit lower. But it's pretty solid at this stage.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","And remember Paul, the clients have paid for this, a lot of the manufacturing stuff, right? So, they're going to want to issue these cards when they can. And again, we have to wait for that. But as Jeff indicated right now, we feel good about where we are in 2016 and going into 2017 also.","Mark A. Ernst - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","The other thing I'd add to that is, 2015 was really the wildcard year from our perspective because we didn't know how fast financial institutions were going to adopt EMV and whether there would a mass reissue. That debate is pretty much behind us now, and we can see what our clients are doing and how they're approaching it. So, we have a pretty good line of sight into what we think is going to happen now in 2016.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. One other point I would make is actually in Q4, we had more demand for bin configuration than we could actually convert. So, we really saw the surge coming into the year which again helps support the confidence. And remember, even if we have a bit of a blip up in 2016, which we believe we will, we do think that we'll get to a steady state level. We don't see that EMV \u2013 we do think that EMV will be constant on a card manufacturing or personalization basis moving forward, so long as plastic is being issued and I think that's going to be issued for a very long time, and then a layer of uptick on the premium processing element of EMV.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","I think I'd also just check out what Mark went over at Investor Day, because it's pretty well holding as far as what we anticipated where we'd be a little softer in 2015 obviously. But nonetheless, it's ramping as we thought it would there.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, that's great. And Jeff, maybe just last thoughts on Popmoney. There's a lot of competition in that space now, and I know you've been really excited about that business. I mean any kind of modifications or changes to your view?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. It is something I still am very excited about. It is taking longer to get scales than I would have liked. But I am very optimistic about the runway for the solution given the pairing of P2P with real-time which I think changes the experience dramatically. And then the other use cases that we have for Popmoney disbursements and some of the charities we think are very important.","And then the last thing is we've got a new technology that we are delivering in 2016. We call it CardFree Cash, and it is a way for our debit clients, our ATM clients to be able to access money in an ATM without a card using the bank's mobile solution. Well, that's actually going to be branded Popmoney across the U.S. So, that brand will show up across 20,000, 30,000 ATMs. So again, we have a good level of comfort that it will grow. Yes, it's competitive but over time I still believe the banks are going to be the ultimate winners of the P2P value.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Congrats, Tom.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you, Paul.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to call our Investor Relations group. And have a good evening.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

We look forward to seeing you there.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a strong start to the year with financial results for the quarter slightly ahead of our internal expectations and sales results well ahead of the prior year. Importantly, we're on track to achieve our 2017 financial outlook. Internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter and adjusted operating income was up 8%. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 60 basis points and adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 18%. Free cash flow per share was stellar, increasing 27%, and that excludes a $31 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture received during the quarter.","We were honored to be named one of the Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies for our fourth consecutive year, a recognition that we share with our clients, associates and shareholders. We were especially proud to be ranked number one for innovation in our category for the second year in a row.","At the beginning of the year, we shared our 2017 key priorities to help you gauge our progress. The first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments. Second, enhance client relationships, with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. And third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.","Our focus on building high-quality revenue translated to 4% internal revenue growth in the quarter, with strong performance in businesses, such as card services, lending solutions and output solutions. Growth in scale businesses, along with continued progress with our operational effectiveness programs combined to deliver 60 basis points of operating margin expansion and 8% growth in adjusted operating income.","You may have seen that we attained a new level of Payment segment margin that we believe is representative of the strength of those businesses moving forward. At the same time, we continue to operate to deliver the right balance between investment, consistent margin expansion and strong free cash flow. As I said, we're pleased with our results in the quarter and are well-positioned to deliver on our financial commitments for the full year.","Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We welcomed Whatcom Educational Credit Union to the Fiserv family in the quarter. This institution, with assets of $1.4 billion, was in the market to upgrade both their core account processing and digital channels technologies in response to the evolving market landscape. In a competitive process, they selected our DNA platform due to its flexibility and modern technology. They also chose Architect, our market-leading digital solution, along with a number of other integrated surrounds, all geared at enabling an exceptional member experience.","We signed a total of five DNA clients in the quarter, including four with assets greater than $1 billion. During the quarter, we also passed the century mark in DNA signings since our acquisition of Open Solutions in 2013. Interest remains high as the market continues to embrace this modern technology platform, combined with the power of Fiserv surround solutions. We expect to see even more over the next several years as we further advance the solution through differentiated product enhancements and integration with our recently acquired market-leading commercial capabilities.","You may recall that we mentioned our Notifi alerting solution in Q4. Notifi enables financial institutions to interact with their customers in a personalized way based on transactional data. We signed over 50 institutions in 2016 to our 1.0 solution and added 20 more in the first quarter. We're excited about this capability and optimistic about the value-add data opportunities that should become available over time.","Digital experience continues to rise in importance for both financial institutions and the customers they serve. Along those lines, Mobiliti ASP continues to grow, increasing nearly 30% over the prior year's quarter and 6% sequentially to 5.8 million subscribers. Our Mobiliti business solution is also taking hold, with sales increasing more than 60% over the prior year. Institutions remain in the early stages of unlocking the power of digital and are looking for additional ways to enable value for their retail and commercial customers.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Last quarter, we told you about our recent acquisition of Online Banking Solutions, or OBS, and its sophisticated digital commercial banking product, now called Commercial Center. OBS is an example of acquired innovation, which when coupled with our other leading solutions, positions us to deliver accelerated client value and additional revenue growth. We're encouraged by the interest that OBS has sparked, especially in larger commercially focused institutions.","We mentioned Architect, our integrated online and mobile banking solution for both retail and business customers earlier as part of the Whatcom Educational Credit Union win. Architect was acquired about a year ago and we signed 14 clients to-date. We also have a growing pipeline of 70 institutions who are exploring this innovative digital solution. We continue to rank digital experience as one of the most critical areas of focus for all financial institutions domestically and around the world.","Last quarter we shared our enthusiasm with you for BillMatrix Next, our biller-based digital payments platform, which allows us to efficiently process any number of payment types. This solution has rapidly opened up the broader bill payment market on both a standalone basis and across our account processing clients, enabling enhanced multi-channel billing and payment capabilities. We're in the early days of our launch plans and even still had 12 new sales in the first quarter, along with a very strong pipeline. We'll share much more about these growth plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day.","Fiserv's PEP+ solution, our integrated payment platform which provides the ACH infrastructure for many of the largest banks in the U.S., recently won an Innovator Award from PYMNTS.com. The award, which recognized our same-day settlement capability, reflects the growing importance of faster payments in this country.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon. Adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $1.3 billion, and internal revenue growth was 4%. Solid execution along with some revenue timing benefits drove internal revenue growth that was slightly ahead of our expectations for the first quarter. We continue to expect internal revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year as revenue related to 2016 sales and contributions from new initiatives come online.","Operating performance was strong, resulting in an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $429 million, and also 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, to 32.5%. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 18% to $1.25, which includes the positive impact of the new accounting treatment for reporting the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation awards. This impact was somewhat offset by low adjusted tax rate in last year's comparable quarter.","Our Payment segment delivered 5% internal revenue growth, led by strong growth in Card Services, Output Solutions and Investment Services. Adjusted revenue was up 7% to $720 million.","Debit transaction growth for the quarter was in the high-single digits, and P2P transactions for the period grew more than 20% year-over-year. P2P growth was driven in large part by real-time transactions which were up significantly, at more than 300% in the quarter. We expect further acceleration in our P2P growth throughout 2017 and 2018 as Zelle is launched later this year.","The Payment segment adjusted operating income was up 16% to $260 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 270 basis points to 36.2%, due to increases in high-quality revenue, benefits from our operational effectiveness programs and, to a lesser degree, the timing of comparable expenses. While we don't expect margins to increase at that level each quarter, we do expect strong performance in the segment for the balance of the year and into the future.","The Financial segment adjusted revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $620 million. Internal revenue growth was up 4%, led by our lending solutions, account processing and international businesses. Revenue growth in the Financial segment was slightly ahead of our expectations due to the acceleration of some periodic revenue we had originally anticipated in the second quarter.","Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was just ahead of the prior year, at $196 million. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 100 basis points to 31.6%, due primarily to higher sales commissions, the timing of periodic expenses and continued investments in newer products, such as Agiliti and Notifi.","The corporate adjusted operating loss in the quarter was up, due primarily to a tough prior year comparison. We expect the corporate segment to remain generally consistent with the first quarter's level for the balance of the year.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with our internal expectations, at 29.4%. As discussed on our last call, we included the positive impact from adopting the new accounting standard for the excess benefit of share-based compensation on our adjusted tax rate guidance for the year. The expected benefit is front-loaded in the year due to the timing of option exercises, investing of restricted units, which can tend to be more concentrated in the first quarter when equity grants typically vest. This benefit was partially offset by a relatively low adjusted tax rate in last year's quarter, producing a net benefit of about $0.06 per share.","Consistent with our prior guidance, we continue to expect a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of slightly below 33%, which translates to a tax rate for the remainder of the year of about 34%. Free cash flow was up a very strong 23% in the quarter to $366 million and up 27% on a per-share basis to $1.67, due primarily to strong operating results and positive working capital. These excellent results do not include a $31 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture.","Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.6 billion, or 2.3 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 3.4 million shares for $389 million in the quarter, which is an increase of more than 20% over last year's comparable quarter and equates to 106% of free cash flow. As of March 31, there were 212.9 million shares outstanding and 17 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. We followed up last year's record fourth quarter sales with a solid start to the year. Overall sales in the quarter were up 30% over the prior year and up 35% domestically, led by strong Financial segment sales. Quota attainment came in at 82%, which, as you can tell by the relative performance, reflects increased sales expectations for the full year. Importantly, our domestic pipeline expanded by 17% in the quarter and we're very well-positioned to meet our sales goals for the year.","Integrated sales increased 7% to $51 million in the quarter, led by Card Services, Digital Solutions and Output Solutions. Providing additional value to our existing client base is an essential part our strategy. We kicked off the second year of our $250 million five-year operational effectiveness program in the quarter and achieved $20 million of savings by primarily by procurement and labor optimization. We also continue to make great progress on our data center consolidation program, combining five locations in the quarter. We're well on track to achieve our $60 million objective for the year.","The market continues to exude optimism, buoyed by the March Fed interest rate hike, a general sense that we will see some form of relief on the regulatory front and a growing confidence that tax reform of some kind will become a reality this year. These factors, combined with the prospect of additional interest rate hikes over the next six months to 12 months, is leading to a longer tail of positive sentiment than we've seen in the long time. Although the jury is out on how that may translate translate to incremental technology spend over time, we are having more conversations about technology focused on digital, commercial services, cyber security and revenue generation, which aligns well with our source as solution differentiation. Lastly, we continue to be excited about the prospects of bank-based P2P and remain quite active partnering with our clients and DWS to bring Zelle to life later this year.","As I said upfront, we're on track to achieve our financial goals for the year and continue to expect internal revenue growth of 4% to 5%. Although we don't provide quarterly guidance, we did give color that the first quarter was likely to be the low point for our internal revenue growth for the year. For modeling purposes, given our strong start, we don't expect our Q2 internal revenue growth rate to be higher than that of Q1. As shared previously, we fully expect internal revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year. We continue to anticipate adjusted earnings per share will grow 14% to 17%, or $5.03 to $5.17 for the year, that adjusted operating margin will expand more than 50 basis points and that free cash flow per share will be at least $5.45 for the full year.","In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year. We're making progress against our strategic priorities, setting ourselves up to achieve our financial outlook for the year and building momentum towards further growth acceleration in 2018. Investing in tomorrow while delivering results for today is not easy. Thankfully, we have more than 23,000 talented associates who focus their collective energy on creating superior value for clients and shareholders each and every day.","With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","The 30% increase in sales, Jeff, you called out 60% growth in Mobiliti as a driver. Are there are any other big drivers behind that? And to what extend do you think this elevated level of sales growth is sustainable for the balance of the year?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. That's great. The 60% increase in Mobiliti business sales for the year is a driver of it, but it's not a significant driver. The biggest drivers of sales for the year, we had a very good quarter in our credit union business. We're making great strides on the digital front, digital including Architect, as I talked about earlier. We had good growth in our biller businesses. We had actually pretty good growth across the board.","There were a couple of areas that had a little bit of a slow start because we had such a strong \u2013 you'll remember, such a strong fourth quarter and we actually had a pretty darn good third quarter as well. So, but the pipelines have been growing. Whether or not we can sustain 30% year-over-year, you'll remember that last year the first quarter was fairly soft for us. But we do believe we will have higher sales again this year and, most important, that even the pipeline with higher sales will actually be up going into 2018. So lots of good momentum in the market.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","How should we think about the time to convert these new sales into revenue?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Normal \u2013 I would say it's our normal cycles. I mean, you're talking about anywhere between six months on the low end. But really call it in the nine month to 12 month, nine month to 15 month range.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then the big margin expansion in Payment to 32.6%. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that expansion in a little more depth? And then to what extent is the 32% to 33% level the new high watermark?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, David, it's Bob. Overall, obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of the business for the quarter. There are number of things, we talked about few of them in the opening remarks.","First off, I'd say we had some nice drop-through rates on our scale payments platforms. The mix of business was nicely favorable. We talked a little bit about timing of both periodic revenue as well as variable expenses. So the flow within an individual quarter was favorable for us in the first quarter.","I would say that we certainly expect the full year to be strong and expect meaningful expansion of our operating margin on a year-over-year basis. I would not expect 270 basis points for the year. But certainly I'm seeing nice progress both in terms of a strong mix and a scalable business, as well as good management of expenses. And, of course, they're also benefiting from the strong operational effectiveness. You heard for the quarter, we delivered $20 million of savings on a full year expectation of $60 million. So we're off to a great start there.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, David. I would add a couple of things. And this is, you know us well. So you will know this maybe our highest margin ever in the Payments segment in the quarter. And to Bob's point, while we don't expect to have 270 basis points, we are at an interesting inflection point where for, call it, the last four quarters for sure, but even a little bit before that, we were getting dragged down a bit in this segment on margin due to things like the EMV conversion. And we got that growth as we start to transition over from having that lower margin revenue go out and the higher margin continuing to build payments and Mobiliti and these ASP solutions that we've been investing in for the last several years.","As those are starting to now come online combined with the moderation of the some of the investments in the Payments segment, that we would expect to see the margins really be up into this higher ZIP Code. Again, to Bob's point, not as high as they are in this quarter. But we do see the nice, nice tailwind in Payments segment margins certainly throughout this year and going into next year.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. Good to hear. Just a quick final question for me. The 27% free cash flow growth year-over-year in the quarter, that's obviously much higher than your annual guidance for free cash flow growth. I'm a little curious why you're not raising the free cash flow guidance for the year. And to what extent are some of the growth we saw in the first quarter one-time in nature?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, David, we feel really good about the performance in the quarter. We also recognize that this is the first quarter. We had some positive working capital benefits and we had been taking a little bit of a hit on working capital the last couple of quarters. And so it's just too early to make that call. We like the start. We'll see where we are in the second quarter and we'll certainly update you at that stage.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Congratulations.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Koning from Baird. Your line is now open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi there.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, David.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, David.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And I was wondering if you could just kind of isolate some of the factors. That organic revenue growth, it was about the strongest I think it's been in five quarters. And it's very, very tight range obviously. But maybe you could just talk through some of the one-off. I think you said there was a little bit of an early revenue recognition on some product that came through quicker than you thought. And maybe just parse out license and term fees and maybe a currency impact.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","So a multi-pronged question, David. Overall, obviously a good start. We did see some benefit in the quarter of positive timing, particularly in some license and term fees that came in earlier in the quarter than we had initially anticipated.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Earlier in the year.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Earlier in the year, Q2, end of Q1. Certainly like to see the performance in both segments and see the Financial segment growing a little bit nicer. Again, we certainly see some timing. And I think Jeff's opening comments when we reiterated the full-year guidance, we talked about Q2 will likely be down below Q1 levels of bit (25:15).","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, David, just let me add a couple things. So we continue to see really good gains in our Transactional businesses, the Debit business, P2P, you heard Bob talk about real-time. Real-time, now, arguably it's on a small base, but 300% improvement is still a 300% improvement year-over-year.","We also ran a program inside the company in the first quarter that we called Fast Start. And that was really about getting people focused on driving revenue early in the year, driving sales early in the year so that we could shorten our conversion cycle. And that drove some nice license revenue because our sales \u2013 a lot of our products are license-oriented and so we got a nice start there.","And this is the first quarter in a while that we haven't had much FX. As you know, we don't report constant currency and so we had kind of stabilization in FX. But, overall, we feel good about the start to the year and we feel even better about our guidance for the full year.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for that. And then just one follow-up. You anniversaried the ACI and HP acquisitions. I know they're not big, I'm just wondering maybe you can talk a little bit how those have been growing and executing. And then, if there is any margin impact, you talked last year about a little headwind from those two. And margins are so good right now. I don't know if those are still a headwind or not.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So the HP acquisition anniversaried, I think, in January. And I think the ACI acquisition is kind of March-ish. And so that would have still been in the quarter in terms of the \u2013 no effect on internal revenue growth and the margin would also be compressed. And those acquisitions, David, did serve to step our margins down. I want to say it was in the 20 basis points, 30 basis points in this quarter. And last year, for most of the year it was in the 30-ish basis point range. So we are growing over that. And while we won't have any compression as it anniversaries, it did serve to put a little bit of pressure on the margin. It's one of the reasons why we feel so much better about our Payments margin.","The other thing I would say is, as it relates to the acquisitions, the HP acquisition was a big part of the BillMatrix Next technology that we're very enthusiastic about. We're actually going to talk about that at Investor Day. And then I mentioned that we've sold the Architect solution 14 times and have 70 institutions in the pipeline right now all looking at it. We think, again, that was responsive to the market. So no big revenue growth yet from those solutions, but a good momentum.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. This is Mark Ernst. The only thing I'd add to that is a lot of the cost takeouts which we talked about when we did those deals have been \u2013 we're finally getting through some of that work.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","We're just at the early stages of starting to feel it.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","That's it.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Well, nice job.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Maybe just help us reconcile the two sales figures you gave. So sales were up 30%, but quota attainment up 82%. I'm struggling a little bit with whether we should view that as a good result or not?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, Chris. I tried to allude to it in my remarks. The 30% year-over-year is the actual sales result versus the actual sales result last year. And as you may remember, we had kind of a weaker first quarter. But when we set our quota, we set our quota to expectations for the full year. And so we typically start out a little bit slower relative to quota in Q1. So being at 82%, even though it was much higher than last year, it's still not quite where we expect us to be for the full year.","For the full year, we expect to make up those 18 percentage points that we didn't get in Q1. It's not a perfectly straight line. It doesn't perfectly match our sales cycle. So 82% is actually a reasonably good start because it not only reflects the big prior-year gain, but it reflects our increased expectations for the year. If we get to 100%, that's a very good year.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Got you. Let's see. On the cash flow, obviously a big quarter. It looks like the payable days continue to climb as they have the last several years. How much more room is there for that story to play out? And I guess do you expect, maybe not this year, but over the next few years, for free cash flow to start to look a little bit more like net income?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Obviously, cash flow is, well, number one, a very important metric for us, and, two, been a very good story. And with our guidance for 2017, we have high expectations and have started out nicely. Part of that is the basic operating performance, so strong net income and managing that working capital.","We saw working capital grow a bit in the second half of last year, particularly in receivables, and saw that come down nicely in Q1, which was a key part of the strong start to the year. We certainly anticipate continuing to manage that number down, both in terms of dollars as well as days. So it's continuing to be an opportunity for us. And certainly measuring free cash flow as a percent of net income is an important efficiency measure on the performance there.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","And, Chris, I would expect, just based on our history, we have a strong history of running above earnings. And there's no reason to believe that won't continue, given how we manage our capital outlays as well. I mean, we, I think over the last decade, maybe we've had two years, three years where we've not been above, but we're pretty consistent there.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Got you. And then, lastly, on the tax benefit that you guys are seeing. If we assume the current stock price, Bob, and can you give us some sense of what kind of that total tax benefit associated with stock comp and RSUs would look like over the next several years I guess in totally? I'm just trying to figure out what that number would be. And then, I think the 34% to 35% range is kind of the normalized tax rate range, right?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. So, outside of the change in accounting rules, we would've typically, as you said, had a 34% to 35% tax rate. So call it a 1.5 points, 2 points benefit, which is for this year about $0.13 or $0.14. We saw a strong performance in the first quarter. That excess tax benefit will very typically on an annual basis come in strong in the first quarter of every year, given the timing of vesting of those stock options restricted units. The $0.13 to $0.14 is what we guided to 90 days ago when we gave first guidance. And now with the first quarter behind us, we are continuing to hold that $0.13 to $0.14.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","The other thing I would say is it is difficult to predict with precision what that number will be. To your point, the stock price today is quite different than the stock price was even in the middle of the first quarter. And so where \u2013 if you said what would \u2013 it would extrapolate out higher now because we would have larger inherent gains in the employee equity portfolio. But you have to try to predict who but you have to try to predict who is going to sell when and things like that. The $0.13, $0.14 \u2013 I think Bob said $0.13, $0.14. I think that's really based on historical performance. I mean, to the extent that the share price moves, that probably gets a little bit larger, but it's going to be in that range.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","There can be some variability to this metric, which is one of the reasons why folks like me don't like having it roll through earnings per share. But given the preponderance of effect occur in the first quarter and that quarter now being behind us, that $0.13 to $0.14 should be in very good shape for a full-year basis.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Yeah. We're just struggling with how to model \u2013 figure out the valuation impact on all of our companies given the basically trying to take a present value of the tax benefit and then bake in the normalized tax rate. So thank you.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Could you maybe talk about the timing of the deal pipeline as you currently see it? I think, Jeff, you commented that Q2 growth rate wouldn't be higher than Q1. So do you expect all business that slipped into 2017 to still occur in 2017? And maybe give us a sense of how that cadence of revenue growth rolls in in Q3, Q4?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. Sure, Jim. We had made a comment for modeling purposes when we gave guidance, which we don't typically do. But we had anticipated that Q1 would likely be the lowest quarter of the year and that we would generally see sequential increases after that.","And that was really two-fold. It was what we could see on the periodic revenue front. It was not \u2013 actually three reasons. It was not understanding how the new Fast Start program would impact our revenue.","And then, third, to your point around the ramp of sales and implementations, the only thing that's going on is really the movement of the periodic revenue, as you know. And it doesn't take very much to move our internal growth percentages. And so just based on what we see right now, we think it's prudent to model to the saying that the second quarter will likely not be higher than the first. But there's no change; we still expect the second half of the year to be higher than the first and we would expect the exit rate to the year to be indicative of where we're going to be in 2018.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And then maybe, Jeff, on the broad topic of regulatory reform and relief. You talked in your opening comments about some general effects. But I guess on the positive side, can you broadly talk about the impact that the CHOICE Act, if passed, would have on your business across different aspects?","And then maybe on the flip side, on the negative side, can you maybe talk about if there's an ease up of regulation at banks, whether there would be any trend that you would see that would maybe trend towards less outsourcing of core platforms rather than more?"," Yeah, let me take the latter piece first. The best we can tell there's no movement. And I don't see that regulatory itself will do anything other than continue to push technology burden on companies like us. And so even if and when the regulatory burden eases a bit, because of the speed in which technology is evolving and the expectations that consumers have and their desire to have their financial institutions deliver faster, more feature-rich experiences, I don't see that having any impact.","We are starting to hear a little bit of discussion on things like a hybrid computing, which is a mixture of having institutions run pieces of a platform inside their four walls and having us run parts of it outside the four walls. But that's a newer trend. The discussions around cloud and all kinds of things like that. So from our perspective, we don't see a lot of risk there. And, again, we're developing more and more solutions that \u2013 investing in more and more solutions that feel cloud-esque. And that really is geared also to a lower TCO and I think that will help.","On the notion of the CHOICE Act, my take on that is generally if you're going to see less regulation, that's going to be a good thing. Right now, Dodd-Frank tended to provide some protection at the community bank level. We'll have to see how this all plays out. I think for now, our belief is, net-net, regardless of what happens, you're going to see an easing of the implications to banks. Not that consumers won't be more protected, but just an easing. And that will be good and hopefully translate to some more value for them and, therefore, for us.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.","Arvind Ramnani - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi. You have outlined a pretty good picture your core clients being in better shape with this regulation and interest rates, increased interest in digital. But can you maybe help us understand what's driving confidence in second half performance and also potentially what can drive upside or downside to the second half ramp?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. One of the beauties and the difficulties of our model is we sell well ahead of the implementations of the technology. And so we have a pretty good eye right now into what will get implemented in each of the, call it, the next three to four quarters. So that gives us the kind of visibility so that we have some confidence in being able to project what's going to happen.","Now, the downside to that is our clients are still \u2013 they still have development queues that they have to work through and clients have to do their share and we have to do our share. So it's not an exact science, but it does give us reasonable visibility. And we have good financial rigor in the company. We learned some lessons last year on some of the challenges that we had. And so we feel confident that we'll see accelerated revenue growth in the second half of the year.","Arvind Ramnani - Pacific Crest Securities","Great. And then just on your Payments, your faster growing Payments business. Are there any specific areas within Payments that could drive structural secular or acceleration in growth? Or do you think Payments is going to do better, but any specific drivers that could make it grow even faster?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. In all of those businesses, if you take something like debit growth, debit is growing nicely, it's growing high-single digits. And arguably debit is, in fact, a secular trend. People are using it. The adoption curves tend to lag in the community banking market from the largest banks. And so we're riding that secular trend.","Mobile banking is still very early. And so we would expect that over the next five to seven to 10 years that mobile banking will be the standard. Today, about 75% of consumers use online banking. And yet there's only about 40%, 50% using mobile. And so there's a lot of additional opportunity there.","And then probably the last one I would point out right now is P2P. We have been pushing P2P through our Popmoney solution for the last four or five years. We are very excited about the Zelle initiative, which is early warning systems, the large banks and the community banks, many of which are going through us, as well as a number of the large banks. And so we think that will go from a very small business. Currently, most of the pundits are saying that that could be as big as $300 billion come 2020 in terms of size of P2P market from a very small market today. So early, early stage in what we believe will become a secular trend over time. Those are just a few examples.","Arvind Ramnani - Pacific Crest Securities","Thank you very much. And good luck for the remainder of the year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. I appreciate you taking our call.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","I was looking at the integrated sales growth. Now it was 7%. Was that 17% last period?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I'm sorry, would you repeat the question?","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","The integrated sales growth was 7% this period down from 17% last period?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, it may have been. We don't really think about it on that basis. The fourth quarter of the year is typically always your biggest quarter there. So 7% sales is pretty good growth in the dollar value. If you look at the dollar value, that's the most important piece of that. And, again, that's integrated into our sales number.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Got it. Thanks for the clarification.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","And with the number coming in at $20 million already on the savings efficiency initiative, should we think of that amount probably coming over again this year as it did last year with the $60 million target? Or will that maybe possibly slow down a little bit?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, some of that benefit is actually that we had a strong second half of last year. And so now that's kind of rolling into the first part of this year. So not necessarily surprising to have a strong start. It's early in the year, so I'm certainly not ready to change that guidance. Some of that is new activity. And we've got a five-year program; we're in year two of it. At $60 million this year, at the end year two, at the end of this year, we'll be $120 million against a $250 million five-year goal. So we'll be in great shape.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","All right. Thanks, guys.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Tien-Tsin.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Jeff. Good to talk to you. It's great, as usual. I guess a little more balanced growth between the two segments here, Payments and Financial. Should we expect tighter growth between the two for the balance of 2017? Just playing around with the model here, trying to think about comps. Anything to call out?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, you actually heard a couple of questions about Jeff's answer on the secular trends in the Payments segment. We typically see Payments slightly stronger than our Financial segment. That's been the last couple of years and I would anticipate that to be again this year. Clearly, in the first quarter, it was a bit more balanced. But overall, the trends in the Payments segment are a bit stronger than what we would see in the Financial segment. So the last couple of year trend I think will continue this year by the end of the year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Although, Tien-Tsin, I would say that we do expect higher growth in the Financial segment.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Right, right.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","We're not giving guidance to your question. We do expect a little bit more growth in the Financial segment this year, given the performance last year and some of the sales and all of that.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Right.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, that would tie up well with what you've been taking about on the call. I guess as a last question just on the M&A front. I figured I'd ask, your appetite to do acquisitions, there's been a few more deals announced I guess in the industry in Q1. PayPal is talking about the TIO Network, bill payment acquisition earlier. So I'm curious if your appetite has changed at all and what we might expect.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, we continue to have the same capital allocation strategy that we have had. But we look it a lot. We don't buy very much, but we look at a lot. And I do see opportunities for us to get into the market faster by doing some product-oriented acquisitions. So last year we did the little \u2013 the HPE deal, we did the CFS carve-out, we did the OBS acquisition. So I think you'll see us do smaller capability-oriented acquisitions where it makes sense and it's really supportive of our strategy. I do think that's a reasonable use of capital just given how fast the market is moving right now.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Terrific. I'll look for you guys at Investor Day.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","All right. Thanks so much.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Jeffery W.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Paul Seamon","Thank you and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from the actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our materials for today\u2019s call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks, Paul and good afternoon, everyone. We made important strategic progress in the quarter through several acquisitions, which further expanded our solution set in the fast-growing areas of payments infrastructure and digital enablement. We expect these transactions to enrich the differentiation of our solutions, deliver meaningful value to our clients and further enhance our internal revenue growth profile. Although we remain on track to achieve our full year financial outlook, revenue in the third quarter was below our expectations. This shortfall was driven primarily by the timing of periodic revenue, the majority of which we expect to reverse in Q4 contributing to a strong internal revenue growth exit rate and setting the stage for higher growth in 2018. Internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter pressured by a $16 million reduction in periodic revenue versus the prior year.","The growth rate in the quarter was also impacted by tough comparison for EMV card production revenue growth versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Even with the decline in higher margin periodic revenue, adjusted earnings per share was up 11% in the quarter and has increased 13% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down slightly versus the prior year to 32.6% and up 60 basis points sequentially. This comparison is against last year\u2019s high watermark for adjusted operating margin and also includes a 40 basis point headwind from our 2017 acquisitions. Sales performance in the quarter stepped up coming in at 106% of quota and is now at 91% attainment year-to-date. Our pipeline remains strong and we are on track to meet our full year sales objectives.","Now, let me update you on our three key shareholder priorities for 2017 which are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and finally, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continue to build high-quality recurring revenue in the quarter even in the face of lower than anticipated headline growth. The combination of lower periodic revenue and a decline in the revenue growth contribution from EMV impacted our comparative quarterly internal revenue growth rate by roughly 230 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share was up 11% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date. We have raised the bottom end of our adjusted EPS guidance and now expect results in the range of 14% to 16% growth for the year. We are well on our way to achieving our 32nd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.","Our business continues to demonstrate strong adjusted operating margin and free cash flow characteristics. Adjusted operating margin through September 30 is up 20 basis points, which includes 20 basis points of compression from our recent acquisitions. Free cash flow is up 10% year-to-date and we are on pace for another strong performance year across all of our key free cash flow metrics. Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We have talked at length about the importance of providing strategic solutions across our account processing client base.","To that end, we were pleased to expand our relationship with Prosperity Bank in the quarter. With more than $22 billion of assets, the bank selected our market leading architect, commercial center and debit processing solutions to transform their digital and payments experiences. We are seeing tremendous market momentum since adding these solutions to our market leading digital suite. We are pleased to renew our important relationship with NCR this quarter as a reseller of payment services through their digital insights solutions. This multiyear agreement enriches our longstanding bill payment partnership and helps both parties extend their payments leadership.","Mobility ASP subscribers were up more than 20% in the quarter and increased 4% sequentially to 6.4 million. Mobility business has also continued to expand with users nearly doubling in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continue to believe Zelle is an important catalyst to change the way consumers move money. As the leader in FI-centric P2P, we are encouraged by additional Zelle signings, progress on client implementations and as you have likely seen early signs of very strong transaction growth. BMO Harris Bank, part of BMO Financial Group, a highly diversified financial services provider based in North America designed with Fiserv to bring new capabilities and an integrated money movement platform to their customers in the U.S. using our market leading CheckFree RXP, TransferNow and Zelle solutions. We also signed Regents Bank to our turnkey Zelle solution in the quarter bringing to 8 the number of top 25 banking institutions that to-date have opted for our full Zelle solution. While still early in the decision, implementation and adoption cycle, we remain encouraged by the market enthusiasm for Zelle and expect to see measurable growth in 2018 and well into the future.","As we introduced earlier in the year, our new integrated biller strategy offers a unique value proposition across several key solution areas. As one of our early proof points, Freedom Mortgage, a leading mortgage lender expanded its existing relationship by adding LoanCmplete to enable faster, more efficient loan processing while reducing overall risk. Our new strategy is already producing sales, which is further increasing our conviction around this unique approach to integrated client value. As I mentioned, we closed three acquisitions in the quarter to help drive innovation and client value, including PCLender, which strengthens our portfolio of digital lending products through next-generation mortgage origination technology. In September, we closed the acquisition of Monitise, which we expect will accelerate both our digital strategy and the development of a next-generation digital banking platform. Importantly, the cooperative bank in the UK with assets of \u00a325 billion became the first client to purchase our newly acquired FINkit solution. Interest has grown since our acquisition and we expect this to be first of many sales of this unique digital capability.","We also acquired Dovetail Group Limited, a leading provider of payments and liquidity management solutions. Dovetail\u2019s payments platform, which is one of the top payments infrastructure solutions in the world, enables Fiserv to help financial institutions transform their payments infrastructure to meet the changing needs of wholesale, commercial and retail customers. Dovetail positions us as a leader in the rapidly growing global payments market. Reaction to these acquisitions has been excellent and we are optimistic about our ability to deliver differentiated client value while further extending our growth profile.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results.","Bob Hau","Thanks, Jeff and good afternoon. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 2% to $1.3 billion and increased 3% to $4 billion through September 30. Internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and is 3% for the year-to-date. While the third quarter\u2019s internal revenue growth rate was lower than we anticipated, it was largely driven by the $16 million year-over-year decline in periodic revenue. The majority of which was in the financial segment. In addition, we had a large comparative EMV growth headwind in the quarter, which pressured both overall internal revenue growth as well as in the payments segment. As we have shared throughout the year, we expected internal revenue growth to accelerate into the second half of the year. This is still the case as we expect our fourth quarter\u2019s results to include much of the periodic revenue delayed in Q3 and to be our strongest internal revenue growth quarter for the year.","Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 1% to $435 million and is up 4% through September 30 to $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating margin of 32.6% was down 20 basis points in the quarter and is up 20 basis points for the year-to-date to 32.4%. Current year acquisitions had a 40 basis point negative impact on adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Absent the acquisitions, adjusted operating margin would have been up 20 basis points in the quarter and up 40 basis points year-to-date. As a footnote, the reduction in periodic revenue in the quarter had an 80 basis point negative impact on adjusted operating margin in the third quarter. Our results are benefiting from the combination of high-quality recurring revenue and exceptional operational effectiveness program execution, which has already surpassed our full year target of $60 million. We are on pace for at least 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the year, which includes headwind from acquisitions as well as the write-off we discussed in the second quarter.","Adjusted earnings per share, was up 11% to $1.27 in the quarter and is up 13% to $3.71 for the first 9 months of the year, setting the stage for another year of double-digit adjuster earnings per share growth. Payments segment adjusted revenue was up 5% both in the quarter and year-to-date to $733 million and $2.2 billion respectively. Internal revenue growth grew 3% in the quarter and is up 4% year-to-date. Segment internal revenue growth was led by strong results in both card services and electronic payments partially offset by the difficult compare from EMV card production. Last year\u2019s third quarter was the peak revenue period for EMV card production and although we are still seeing revenue build from EMV, the growth is at a more normalized level and a major step up in growth contribution from EMV revenue anniversaries in fourth quarter.","Our debit transaction growth in the quarter was in the mid single-digits and P2P transactions grew 20%. Real-time transactions were up more than 100% in the quarter led by growth in Popmoney instant payments. As Jeff noted earlier, Zelle transaction growth is strong albeit off of very small base and we remain optimistic about the near to mid-term growth potential for P2P. Payments segment adjusted operating income in the quarter was up 5% to $254 million and is up 7% to $753 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 34.6% and is up 60 basis points to 34.7% through September 30.","Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $619 million in the quarter and $1.9 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was flat in the quarter due primarily to the timing of license and termination fee revenue, which had a negative impact on segment internal revenue growth of more than 200 basis points. For the first 9 months of the year, the segment\u2019s internal revenue growth rate was 2%, a step up over the 1% growth last year. Adjusted operating income for the Financial segment was $204 million for the quarter and $614 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points to 33.1% in the quarter driven largely by the timing of the high margin periodic revenue. And for the first 9 months of the year, adjusted operating margin in the segment was flat at 33%. An important driver of the Financial segment\u2019s success is our account processing footprint. Our DNA continued its market momentum adding 9 clients in the quarter as compared to 5 in the prior year and we have signed 20 clients to DNA for the year-to-date and 5 DNA clients went live in the quarter, including 2 with assets greater than $1 billion.","Corporate and other adjusted net operating loss in the quarter was in line with expectations and consistent with comparable prior year results. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.1%. This is better than anticipated due primarily to the successful resolution of several discrete tax items earlier than anticipated along with the excess tax benefit of share-based compensation. We expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of about 35% and a full year rate of just below 32%. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was solid increasing 10% to $819 million. Free cash flow conversion was 102% year-to-date and is in line with our expectations. We repurchased 2.4 million shares in the quarter and we returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders through September 30. At quarter\u2019s end, there were 208.8 million shares outstanding and 12.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","Total debt as of September 30 increased due to acquisitions to $5.1 billion or 2.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We will continue to leverage to the strength of our balance sheet, combined with excellent free cash flow to create meaningful value for clients and shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks Bob. Sales momentum picked up in the quarter gaining nearly 40% sequentially and coming in at 106% of quota. Comparatively, sales were down 6% versus the record results in last year\u2019s third quarter, but are still up 3% year-to-date. We enter our traditionally strongest sales quarter at 91% of quota and a domestic pipeline without the benefit of any of our recent acquisitions, up 17% year-over-year. We are highly confident we will achieve our full year sales objectives.","Integrated sales were $76 million in the quarter. Our traditional results were driven primarily by payments and digital solutions aided by growing contributions from our new billing and payments integrated sales focus. Our ability to deepen client relationships through add-on solutions remains an important component of our company\u2019s strategy. Operational effectiveness savings were $22 million in the quarter and are $62 million year-to-date. As Bob mentioned, we have eclipsed our full year goal of $60 million a quarter early on the strength of workforce optimization and procurement.","We continuously focused on how to make our model more effective to ensure we have the capacity to invest in growth and service while expanding adjusted operating margin consistent with our long-term strategy. We continue to see optimism in the banking market with rate tailwinds and increasing attention on driving revenue growth. Acquisitions remain a focus in the industry as market participants look to rationalize cost and branch infrastructure. Digital remains the absolute priority with an eye towards providing high-value experiences across small business and commercial services. New payment solutions such as Zelle will continue to put heat and light on rising consumer expectations and pressure institutions to deliver services to that evolving standard.","Over time, we believe institutions will continue to invest meaningfully in technology to meet the needs of a growing digitocracy. As I have said at the top of the call, we remain on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. Given where we are in the year, we are narrowing our 2017 internal revenue growth guidance to 4%, which implies fourth quarter growth of at least 5% as a solid jumping off point for 2018. We raised the low end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.02 and are now expecting a range of $5.05 to $5.12, reflecting growth of 14% to 16% for the year. We continue to expect that full year adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points. This underlying performance will be even stronger than the actual result from considering the impact of in-year acquisitions. And importantly, we expect free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 108% to 111% of adjusted net income.","In conclusion, we have made important strategic progress this year both organically and through acquisition. We expect to meet our financial commitments leading to our 32nd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, expanded high-quality revenue and excellent free cash flow. Lastly, we are pleased to see an increase in our associate engagement scores for the fifth year in a row, ensuring that our thousands of employees around the world remain committed to delivering excellence for the company and its clients is the critical element of our formula for long-term success.","With that, operator, let\u2019s open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Togut","Thank you. Good evening.","Jeff Yabuki","Hi, David.","David Togut","Jeff, you called out a $16 million year-over-year decline in periodic revenue, could you breakdown the components of that between software and contract term fees and then why the conviction that, that will improve significantly in Q4 and drive up organic revenue growth?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. The substantial majority of it was contract termination fees a bit of license and as you know well in this industry we get \u2013 we have a lot of visibility to termination fees on a institution by institution basis, it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to judge exactly when they are going to come in. We had thought that a number of them would come in already and so we have got some reasonable conviction that they will come in, in Q4 and if they don\u2019t come in, in Q4, they will come in, in Q1, but we feel like where we are now that we will see that come in. And license is always strong in Q4 because of the seasonality and so we would expect that to pickup as well.","David Togut","Got it. And then you highlighted some optimism in your remarks around bank, any read on what 2018 bank IT budget growth will look like among your customer base?","Jeff Yabuki","You broke up a bit, I think you were talking about optimism around technology spend overall in the bank space?","David Togut","Correct. And any outlook you have for 2018 bank IT budget growth?","Jeff Yabuki","So, I am not a great prognosticator about how banks will \u2013 how their spend will be in the aggregate, but I do know based on what we see in conversations with the market on a daily basis that banks will continue to focus their energy on all things digital in terms of whether it\u2019s moving over to technology such as Zelle we are seeing a lot of demand for our Architect and Commercial Center solutions and so that is a critical element of where spend is going. You also have a lot of focus in areas of risk, cyber and in just ensuring that the back offices and the back office infrastructure can keep up with the front office demands of rising expectations. It\u2019s one of the reasons why frankly we see contingency good growth in areas like DNA, Premier and other of our headline kind of star account processing platform. So, we have a lot of conviction overall that those areas will continue to pick up and then lastly of course payments. So whether it\u2019s Zelle, we did our Dovetail acquisition in the quarter really because the world is moving to real-time money movement faster than we anticipated say a year or a year or two ago and so we see that to be important part of our portfolio. So, we are going to see more bulking up of spend there. Frankly, some of it will be offset by reductions in other areas, but we feel pretty fortunate about where our investments have been and where we will ride that wave of increasing spend.","David Togut","Thanks so much for the insight. Just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. How much did the three acquisitions closed in Q3 contribute to revenue in Q3 and rest of year?","Jeff Yabuki","So it wouldn\u2019t be anything on the internal side, but Bob I don\u2019t know if you can supply the...","Bob Hau","Yes, David, the three of them closed throughout the quarter, so not meaningful in the third quarter to speak of one of them mid-August, the other beginning of September. So, you saw a little bit, but to Jeff\u2019s point not included in our internal revenue growth metric.","David Togut","Great. And then just end of period share count?","Bob Hau","208.8 million shares.","David Togut","Understood. Thanks so much.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks, David.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open.","Dave Koning","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks.","Jeff Yabuki","Hi Dave.","Dave Koning","So I guess, this quarter is a little granular, but the last five Q4\u2019s revenue spend up between $35 million and $48 million sequentially. So, it\u2019s very tight actually in terms of how much it grows. It sounds like on top of that normal rate you are going to get maybe that $16 million back into Q4 plus the acquisitions maybe helped by another $10 million sequentially, but just trying to bridge the gap, where is kind of the rest coming from, is there going to be some just unnaturally strong seasonal movements in license or how do we get to that?","Jeff Yabuki","Yes, so it would be \u2013 I mean, there is any number of factors. So, one of them obviously will be the shifting of the periodic revenue as we talked about. We have some acquisitions that have gone from inorganic to organic such as Architect as we have talked about. We have just the aggregate impact of sales and implementations, DNA, Zelle those kinds of things that are coming in. And then we have a lighter compare from the EMV which will also anniversary at the end of Q4 in terms of the drag and so that\u2019s going to lighten up meaningfully in Q4 as well. So, we have all of those things Dave on top of the seasonality that you are talking about. So, the seasonality is the Q3 to Q4 sequential and most of things that I am talking about are more of a Q4-over-Q4 change.","Dave Koning","Okay, okay, got it. And then I guess the one other thing is just EBIT also has to be up like $50 million sequentially, $50 million, $60 million maybe even to get to your numbers and that historically has been kind of has moved around, but kind of sometimes down a little, sometimes up a little, but is a lot of what\u2019s coming on term fees certainly very high incremental margin, but is most of the stuff coming on pretty high incremental?","Jeff Yabuki","Well, to your point, we are going to have based on what relative termination fee revenue was in last year\u2019s Q4 plus some of the periodic revenue that we expect, are the majority of the periodic revenue which we expect will come into Q4 again, that\u2019s going to come in at pretty high margins. So, we are anticipating a very strong margin quarter.","Dave Koning","Got it. Alright, well, thank you for that.","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the EMV production we get the comps are tough, but are you seeing normal re-issuance activity? Has there been any change or is there any fatigue there just trying to understand, because I think FIS had some media growth there as well?","Jeff Yabuki","Yes, Tien-tsin, I would say that we are seeing kind of normal reissue activity, but for the fact that over the last call it 15 months you had some banks decide or financial institutions decide to accelerate their reissue a bit to get on to the EMV bandwagon. And so this year there is a little bit of sorting out going in there, but we are continuing to see institutions issue EMV. We also haven\u2019t had even with all the breach noise in the market, there has not been any big retail breach, which has driven what I would call unusual or off-cycle reissue or at least nothing meaningful.","Tien-tsin Huang","Right. So normal replenishment, nothing like I know you mentioned breach for like Equifax breach things like that sort of slow down as a result it sounds like?","Jeff Yabuki","Yes, at this stage, the institutions are still trying to figure out what to do about the Equifax problem.","Tien-tsin Huang","Yes, just like me. Okay. Just my follow-up and I will jump off. Just thinking about Zelle, you mentioned it would be meaningful in \u201818. It sounds like there is a lot of activity pipeline backlog in terms of banks. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more detail on what you are seeing? Is it really just going after some of the smaller banks and turning them on or are you actually engaging with the larger banks is what you mentioned a bunch on the bigger side, but just trying to understand a little bit better as we go into \u201818?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure, Tien-tsin. So, I think what we have said is we would see some measurable growth in \u201818 and we expect that growth to accelerate. That growth will accelerate for fairly, I think a fairly lengthy period of time. We had Wells talk about over 45% growth in the quarter, we had Bank of America talk about almost 70% growth in the quarter, PayPal another almost 50% growth in their products. So, it feels like the U.S. is moving towards a kind of the early stages of a pretty important wave of P2P advertising launch just yesterday across Zelle. And I think they talked about a double-digit millions kind of initial campaign. So, there is a lot of energy in there. We mentioned in our comments that we have signed officially so far 8 of the top 25 banks were having lots of other conversations. So, we have over 2,000, nearly 2,500 institutions who used our Popmoney solutions a day. I suspect over the next couple of years, most of them will move over, but in the near-term, really the substantial majority of larger institutions will move over to Zelle. And frankly, the benefit that we have is because of the position that we have staked out, I think many of them will either create their own solution or they will come through us in the call it the top 50, top 100 institutions. So, we feel pretty good about our position right now and that will allow us to grow faster early than we may have if we were just back in the days of standard linking into our account processing platforms. So, we are feeling good about where we are today, obviously time will tell, but best we can sort out right now, it\u2019s the wave is starting and we should be well-positioned to ride it.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it. Thanks so much.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Jeff Cantwell","Hi good evening.","Jeff Yabuki","Hi Jeff.","Bob Hau","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Cantwell","Hi thanks for taking my question. On the back of that earlier question about the acquisition, can you talk a little bit about the go forward expectations for those three acquisitions just want to get a better understanding of their size in terms of revenue and their potential impact in 2018?","Jeff Yabuki","For right now we would expect the impact to be fairly muted since our current practice is not pick that up, we might get up under our current practice. I think we would only get a quarter next year. So, we wouldn\u2019t expect it to have much impact there. Monitise was a small public company in the UK. The revenue was public. So, it\u2019s out there. It\u2019s not very large. PCLender was pretty small and Dovetail was pretty small. So, all of these are much more around adding to our solution set and being able to deliver them across our client base. So, we see the inherited \u2013 that was the right way to say it, the inherited organic growth benefiting, but we are optimistic by the time this starts to really layer in to our organic growth that we will have the benefit not only of the businesses that we acquired, but frankly the opportunity to continue to sell it across our base, which is what\u2019s been our frankly our MO and where we have a lot of muscle over time.","Jeff Cantwell","Thanks a lot. I appreciate that. And then just trying to back it up, if you could just take a step back and think high level, could you just help explain to us how those acquisitions did in the context of your overall strategy, I am just thinking in terms of areas like international expansion etcetera?","Jeff Yabuki","Not sure. So, Monitise had both a U.S. \u2013 kind of a smallish U.S. business and a smallish primarily EMEA-based business, both around digital banking. That\u2019s a very important priority for us. So, we are looking to \u2013 always looking for opportunities to create scale, but they also have a very, very unique technology called FINkit that we are using at the center of what we think is a kind of the next wave of where digital is moving to a micro services architecture, which allows much faster adding a feature, function and new capabilities and we are also using it at the center of creating what we believe is the next generation digital banking platform serving larger institutions around the world. So, that\u2019s number one. Around Dovetail, Dovetail is a real-time based payments platform, which is critical as the U.S. makes its move to real-time. So, the primary reason for buying that was to enable us to better serve U.S. based financial institutions and frankly as a very strong benefit is Dovetail serves some of the larger institutions globally and they have a very strong business globally. They are ranked at the top of the world rankings around this payments capability. And so we are excited to have an opportunity to sell that to additional institutions both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And then lastly, PCLender, that is a digital mortgage origination technology as well as in-branch or in-bank origination technology adding that capability into our digital banking platform again to enable our clients to have these best-in-class digital experiences was the rationale for that. And then Architect and Commercial Center that we acquired previously again that\u2019s about building out our digital services to enable banks to serve both retail as well as commercial and small business customers. So, it all really fits in payments and digital that\u2019s the majority of where our acquisition focus has been over the last several years and if I had to guess, I would say, it would continue.","Jeff Cantwell","Great. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Damian Wille","Hi, good evening. This is Damian Wille on for Ramsey. So I just wanted to ask about kind of the segment growth rates here. So, we have seen some moderating segment growth rates more recently. First, is there any change in terms of long-term growth potential for Fiserv? And then secondly kind of given the maturation in the industry, would you contemplate more transformative M&A that might be growth accretive?","Bob Hau","Damian, it\u2019s Bob. On the Payments segment growth rate, there has really been a couple of key drivers. We talked a little bit about them in some of our opening comments. The EMV growth provided a nice lift last year. Q3 was the peak quarter of growth in 2016, so a very difficult compare for 2017 and we will anniversary that revenue growth drivers in the fourth quarter. We also have talked about some of the larger programs that we won last year like the sales activities we had last year and the timing of those implementations because of the size of them and the complexity with our client base from getting those ramped up is going to give us a lift into Q4 of this year and certainly into next year. And of course, we also see the benefit of things like Zelle continuing to mature the advertising that was just launched yesterday will provide a nice lift into those transactions. It\u2019s very early into that growth opportunity. And so we see that lifting into 2018 and beyond and we also talked about the digital insights relationship we expanded. So, we see our payment segment continuing to provide strong internal revenue growth lift relative to the overall company. It has in the past and we will continue to see that going out into the future.","Jeff Yabuki","Yes. I would add a couple of things before we get to the acquisition question. I would say that we have had more jumpiness in our growth rates than we have seen this quarter, so more movement and largely around the periodic revenue, right, having an odd quarter where we are $16 million down in periodic revenue. And one of the reasons, we don\u2019t love that, because it creates some dialogue like this, but we expect to have growth this year that is at or above last year\u2019s level. So, we are targeting 4% which is consistent with our guidance albeit at the low end and we expect to see acceleration as we said in our comments today. So as much as the Payments segment is not quite as strong so far this year largely on the back of EMV financial is actually up year-over-year. And so we think the diversity of our portfolio allows us to be able to comp out the puts and takes of day-to-day business. Underlying all that, we are continuing to build out our recurring revenue, which is one of the reasons why we continue to build out margin. We are adding acquisitions that we think will enhance our growth rates as we go over time. We are already getting some contributions from some of the things we have done over the last couple of years. So, we feel quite good about our portfolio. And then as we talked about in Investor Day, we have added a new corner to our model and that\u2019s our integrated biller strategy, which is a brand new initiative that we have just begun selling off of and delivering value to clients will begin really in earnest next year. So, we feel like the portfolio is in reasonable shape and while there has been some ups and downs in our quarters this year, we do expect to have higher growth this year and higher growth again next year. So, that is at least how I would think about the question on growth rates and the moderation. As it relates to, Damian, on the transformative acquisition, the answer is we are always open to looking at what are the best ways to deploy capital we use as our guiding principle how do we think we can deliver the most value for shareholders and the most value for clients and if that happens to be an acquisition that is kind of labeled in your quotes as transformative and then we will do that. And otherwise, we will continue to go down the path of I think our total payout ratio so far this year is about 120%. So, we will continue to focus on that as well as we have spent several $100 million on acquisitions, so using our balance sheet to make sure that we are creating as much value for shareholders as we can.","Damian Wille","Makes sense. I appreciate it. I will hop back into the queue. Happy Halloween.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Jeff, if we could start with how to think about and square your sales results which were up 21% last year in 2016 and then 3% year-to-date with the comments around accelerated growth outlook, can you maybe give us a little bit of color on how that sales pipeline will kind of convert into revenue, how much from, for example, 2016 will convert to 2018 and 2017 to 2018 to help us give us a sense of the level of conference around that acceleration in revenue next year?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. So, one of the compare challenges in Q3 is we had an unusually, really an unusually large Q3 last year and we would expect to not have \u2013 or sorry, we did not have an unusually large Q3 this year, we had a very solid Q3 actually performed a little bit better than we anticipated as you saw we were 106%, but we do expect to actually have quite a strong Q4 base than what we see in the pipeline today and some of those transactions we believe will have a little shorter implementation windows than we might typically see. Now on the other side of that coin, Jim, some of the larger transactions that we had last year in Q3 are still not live and so that they will end up bleeding into \u201818. So, from that perspective, there is a little bit of a mismatch which is also feeding into our confidence that by the time we get into the second half of \u201818 next year that will have a little bit of a multiplied benefit of sales to revenue in our numbers.","James Schneider","That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe can you also give us your update on kind of the strategic view as you see it, as you talk with your bank partners, the outlook for bank consolidation and M&A in the space clearly from a cyclical perspective whenever you see rates go up dramatically, you tend to get a lot of M&A so what do you see from the kind of the small medium sized bank perspective at this point?","Jeff Yabuki","So, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But I would say that M&A activity has been either fortunately or unfortunately strong for the last several years. We saw a little breather coming in as valuations popped up towards the kind of the last 3, 4 months of last year and into this year. We\u2019re now seeing people kind of get more comfortable with the valuation level and so we\u2019re seeing a little bit more activity there and as I mentioned in our prepared remarks to your point with rates going up and the need to invest in digital and some of the back office infrastructure. I think you\u2019re going to continue to see acquisitions go in at a fairly healthy clip.","James Schneider","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Paulo Ribeiro of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Paulo Ribeiro","Thank you. First question \u2013 hi how are you guys? First question is on the margin, you mentioned that at least 50 basis points and you had some headwinds from the acquisitions. So could you help us get the sense of how much that headwind was and you know try to get more flavor around also how much of that expansion was due to cost-save initiatives or just normal operating leverage? Second point is if you could remind us a little bit about the economics around Zelle not pricing specifically, but how you make money out of that if it similar to pop money? And yes, that\u2019s it. Thank you.","BobHau","Yes, Paulo, excuse me, this is Bob. I\u2019ll answer the margin question. So, first off the margin impact for the second quarter from M&A, so the acquisitions that we completed in 2017 was about a 40 basis point headwind for the quarter and about 20 basis point headwind on a year-to-date basis. We also talked about in some of our prepared comments the impact of the periodic revenue was certainly an impact to the third quarter that comes back to us in the fourth quarter and in Q3 that was an 80 basis point headwind. So, certainly suppressed the third quarter results and of course as that periodic revenue comes back into fourth quarter that gives us the confidence that will achieve that greater than or at least 50 basis point margin expansion on a full year basis. That is really driven on the back of high quality recurring revenue continuing to provide growth throughout 2017 as well as the benefit of operational effectiveness. So through third quarter, we achieved already our full year outlook our original full year guidance for the benefit that operational effectiveness and we\u2019ll continue to see some benefit into fourth quarter.","Jeff Yabuki","Yes, Paulo. As it relates to the economics of Zelle, it is much the same as Popmoney in that \u2013 in that the longer term economics are really built on transaction fees that we realized as the solution builds in the market. I would say in the shorter term this year and probably into the first half of next year for sure more of the revenues from that is coming to us in the form of professional services fees as we are helping our clients get ready for and kind of setup the capability to do this. So in the near-term, it\u2019s really kind of a waiting is a preparation game and then waiting for the transactional list that we think are going to happen with the network effects.","BobHau","Yes, I think Paulo the other thing is to Mark\u2019s point we have services for the larger clients when there is going to be a very significant way of implementation \u2013 an implementation way of the smaller clients and that will likely my guess is it\u2019ll take unfortunately a couple of years at least to get that done. And so there\u2019s going to be \u2013 you\u2019re going to have conversion fees or you\u2019re going to have implementations going on for a long period of time, while the actual transaction growth is ramping.","Paulo Ribeiro","Perfect. Quick follow-up on Zelle, how does it would it work with the TCH, VocaLink solution? Because if I\u2019m correct if anything correctly Zelle now primarily leverage debit networks from Visa, MasterCard and is it the competing offering when TCH because you guys involved with that to right. How should I think about Zelle versus the TCH solution?","Jeff Yabuki","Yes. You really think about it as you know Zelle is a real-time, it\u2019s a transaction. There are several ways of delivering on a real-time transaction today that the debit networks being one of those, but only one of those. And in fact I would suspect, I don\u2019t know this for a fact, but I would suspect more the transactions are not going through those rails, they are going through other kind of point-to-point rails that exist in the market between a number of the financial institutions. We are using the NOW Network as the kind of network that connects the various different endpoints that are going that we are installing. The beauty of the NOW Network is that it actually enables \u2013 is enabled to ride any number of different real-time rails that we can apply in different used cases or different situations depending on kind of what the most cost effective and delivery time urgent delivery is for a transaction. So, in many ways, as the clearinghouse capability comes online, it will be another option in the sort of delivery of a transaction, but it will just be another option.","Paulo Ribeiro","Perfect. Thank you. Great color.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.","Blake Anderson","Hi, this is Blake on for Brett. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jeff Yabuki","Sure.","Blake Anderson","You noted at your Analyst Day and in this call as well your new combined biller internet banking and the Zelle product and it sounds like the interest is high. Can you tell us what you think the early client wins see in this product that is really different from existing products and then is there sort of a killer app use case of this product?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. So, Blake, let me clarify. So, the biller strategy \u2013 this integrated biller solution strategy is not about digital banking per se, it\u2019s about enabling billers through the different unique solutions we have which range from acquiring biller payments to lighting up e-bill delivery within our RXP solution to doing print, to doing, we talked about LoanComplete, which is enabling a lender to be able to use some of our back office and risk products. There are some digital capabilities as well. E-bill, electronic statements, electronic communications, so it\u2019s integrating all of that together and basically creating a network for billers, which is to some extent distinctive from the digital banking or what we are doing from the bank in the bank space. Over time, we actually think and to Mark\u2019s point around now, we think we will be able to create a very interesting bank to biller and biller to bank payment exchange, payment network that will be very unique, because of the position that we have, but that\u2019s a down the road \u2013 that\u2019s a down the road strategy. The integrated biller solution strategy is I think we talked about it at Investor Day being over, we see it being over $500 million annual revenue opportunity just cross-selling the products that we have today are nearly $500 million just cross-selling the products that we have today with our existing client base. So, a very good opportunity when I said on the call, I gave an example of Freedom Mortgage who acquired our LoanComplete solution, but we have had several other wins and lots of demand, which is increasing our conviction that this strategy has real legs. Unfortunately, that revenue won\u2019t begin to come on until \u201818 and frankly the propensity of it will be after \u201818, but we are excited about the facts that we will have another layer or another lever of growth that we haven\u2019t had historically.","Blake Anderson","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just my follow-up is, are there clear integrations of your existing Pfizer products into the Dovetail payments up in the near-term?","Jeff Yabuki","Well, I mean, I would say it a different way. There are a number of examples where Dovetail is already integrated into either our account processing products or into banks where we are running PEP+ and some of the other opportunities. One of the most intriguing and exciting opportunities is the thinking about what we have done in the PEP+ ACH network that we have and linking that with Dovetail to frankly create what we think could be a very exciting proprietary payments network for lack of a better way to say it, but one that has not just the payment hub capabilities, but some of the liquidity management solutions, risk solutions and linking that to our Commercial Center product, our cash management products which today is being used by a number of the largest banks in the U.S. as well as into our account processing base. So again, we see a very nice synergy linking into the fact that banks are now earning a lot of attention to making sure they can provide real-time digitally integrated solutions to serve their most valuable customers, which are there commercial and wholesale customers.","Blake Anderson","Great. Very helpful. Thanks.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, guys. Good afternoon.","Jeff Yabuki","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thanks for taking the question. Jeff, I\u2019m wondering if you just comment generally on the competitive environment thinking both in credit unions for the DNA product, where it seems like some nice success. So I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a pricing call out there at all and just generally, we\u2019re hearing about some of these for next-gen cloud-based solutions. Wonder how often you see the mid in RFPs and whether there are sort of change in the competitive conversation at all?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. It\u2019s a great question. So we continue to have \u2013 we continue to have a lot of success with DNA amongst the any number of other solutions, but for clients that our prospects that we put themselves in the technology savvy, we want a modern platform with a lot of database optionality DNA is a pretty good fit, we have a lot of momentum in the larger credit union space. There are some interesting dynamics going on in that space and we feel fortunate that DNA is rising to the top there and so that\u2019s fantastic news. And we\u2019re also seeing good success in the large on the large bank side. As it relates to cloud there is a fair amount of move to cloud in the digital banking space, we \u2013 I think we might imagine last quarter that we now moved architect \u2013 architect or engineered architect I was going to say architect, architect, we\u2019ve engineered architect to be able to run in a cloud, so it\u2019s cloud enabled. And so that\u2019s an important piece of optionality that institutions will want over time. And then there are there is a plethora of other, I\u2019m on the call them FinTechs that would lay claim to being cloud-based solutions, lots of noise and discussion there, but very little real movement at this point. And over time, I really see us and others to be clearing houses of that kind of capability, so delivering it through Architect or through Corillian or through retail online or virtual branch or any of our other digital solutions mobility, mobility ASP and the like. So, there will be here \u2013 there will be here and there decisions made around that, but for the most part we don\u2019t really see any move there or any move in kind of large cloud enablement and on the solution side I guess the last point of clarification I would make is that there is a continuing movement to cloud as a way to run infrastructure period. And so we\u2019re quite happy about that because cloud we think is a more modernized way to talk about outsource and that\u2019s been our business for a long time. And we\u2019re moving our own solutions for the cloud and see that to be good from a pricing perspective and in an efficiency perspective and think that will be the way applications will run over the long haul.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay, thank you.","Jeff Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","AshwinShirvaikar","Yes. Hi, Bob.","Bob Hau","Hi, Ashwin. How are you?","AshwinShirvaikar","Good, good. Thanks. Hey, I wanted to start with just made this comment a few times with regards to the periodic revenues not being in the quarter and I wanted to ask if when it comes to things like term fees for example, I mean if you guys brought this up FIS brought this up. Is this something deeper going on in the background, in the industry generate term fees when there is milestone associated with contact termination? Or are your bank clients pushing off terminations because they are looking at digital transformations, bigger solutions what\u2019s going on in the background there?","Jeff Yabuki","No, Ashwin, there isn\u2019t. From our perspective, we are actually seeing contract terms get a bit longer as opposed to shorter. So, we don\u2019t see that and for us being down and termination fees in the quarter isn\u2019t for a lack of termination fees it\u2019s for regulatory approvals take the time that they take and there are \u2013 there is complexity rate to putting these transactions together. And so that\u2019s what takes the time, I am sorry \u2013 to getting them close. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s taking the time. It\u2019s not \u2013 there is nothing under the covers going on there and in fact termination fees have grown over the last several years and frankly there is no indication that, that\u2019s not going to continue.","AshwinShirvaikar","Okay. Now, I just thought I would check on that. The other question I had was with regards to Monitise and you talked obviously on this call and in other forms about the strategic impact of it. When I look at the digital banking piece, is this \u2013 I mean if you get to the next-gen digital banking platform, you already have clearly and you have the partnership with NCR. Could you help sort of put altogether are these targeted at different markets, different kinds of \u2013 different types of clients or different size banks or what have you. What\u2019s the strategy with regards to having three solutions potentially in the market?","Jeff Yabuki","Sure. So, it\u2019s a great question, Ashwin. We, Corillian is our kind of top of the market solution which runs a number of institutions here in the U.S. and runs something as large as Westpac Bank in Australia. So, it\u2019s quite a robust solution. It\u2019s primarily a solution that is targeted at the online banking space, not the mobile banking space although it has the capability to deliver mobile again as we do in Westpac. What we are looking at doing is bringing our mobile capabilities and our Corillian capabilities together in a single platform using this microservices architecture, which will do two things, it will meaningfully lower TCO for clients and fit into the space that I think about being between the kind of the top 10 in the market. So, for the next and call it the everything below 100, so in that 50 to 90 institutions which are trying to really bite with the largest players, we are looking at architecting a solution that gives them control and a very, very robust structure to bring sophisticated feature function to market when they want to. So, they don\u2019t want an ASP solution, but they also with all the pressure on efficiency ratio, they want a TCO that is more that \u2013 let\u2019s say better fits their economic model. And so acquiring Monitise and bringing the FINkit capability, we saw that we had been looking at doing that and had already started doing that, but the FINkit technology is going to allow us to go meaningfully faster will actually be in market in \u201818 and it will actually end up being a far more sophisticated cloud-enabled technology. So, we are very, very excited about that.","AshwinShirvaikar","Great, thanks.","Jeff Yabuki","Great, thank you and thanks everyone for talking to us this afternoon. If you have further questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great afternoon and evening.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference.

All participants will be in listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Tiffany Willis","Thank you and good afternoon. With me today for the call are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and the anticipated combination with First Data, including expected benefits, financial projections, synergies and timing of and the ability to complete the transaction.","Forward-looking statements may differ materially from the actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure.","These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons.","As a reminder, the prior year's year-to-date adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials and comments are adjusted for the sale of a majority interest of our Lending Solutions business, which closed in March 2018.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Tiffany, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter against our most difficult comparison of the year. We delivered better than anticipated results in the quarter and the first half and well on our way to meet our full-year of financial targets.","Now before we talk about the financial results. Let me provide a brief update on the First Data transaction. We've received all required regulatory approvals and plan to close the transaction on July 29. Well within our original expectations of closing in the second half of the year.","As anticipated, we received all of our approvals without any conditions. We continue to prepare for day one and are focused on moving from integration planning to actual integration. We've announced a number of our senior leadership roles and the entire organization is ready to kickoff the new Fiserv.","Clients and prospects are excited about the opportunities they see for us to deliver a differentiated value and build their businesses in new and unique ways. We've been working on meaningful incremental growth opportunities such as bank merchant, credit solutions, biller services, network, and international.","We believe that integrating the solutions of our two leading companies will create incremental opportunities for clients to better serve their customers, generate additional revenue, operate more efficiently, and better manage risk. Our client first focus should translate to more revenue for Fiserv and may ultimately allow us to exceed our $500 million revenue synergy target.","We've made strong progress on cost synergy planning with a focus on delivering more efficiently for clients and with higher quality. Our teams are focused on the absolute dollar value of the opportunities as well as increasing the pace and timing of those savings.","Upon closing, we will fully deploy our teams with a targeted outcome of exceeding the $900 million target. One of the unique benefits of this transaction is our commitment to increase organic solution investment by $0.5 billion over the next five years. We're acutely aware of the potential competitive advantages to making the right investments in this time of transformational market change.","We're in the early stages of scoping the first round of these investments, which we believe will ultimately further accelerate growth and profitability. We recently raised funds to refinance First Data's debt in a more favorable interest rate environment than we anticipated at the time the acquisition was announced. At today's rates, this translates to additional annual savings of approximately $120 million ahead of our original expectations.","All of this taken together reinforces our belief that the combination will produce more than 20% accretion to adjusted EPS in the first 12 months and more than 40% accretion at the full synergy run rate.","We're thrilled to be on the precipice of closing this transaction and moving forward together. We're even more convinced that this transformative combination will extend leadership and value for clients, create important opportunities for associates and deliver above market returns for shareholders for many years to come.","Now back to the financial results. Internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter and adjusted earnings per share growth was 9%, both against the very difficult prior year compare. For the first half of the year, internal revenue growth was 4% and adjusted earnings per share was up 11%.","Momentum remains strong as sales increased 17% in the quarter and it's up 14% through June 30. We fully expect to achieve our sales objectives for the year. We held annual client conference Forum 2019 in May, hosting over 6,000 professionals at keynote addresses, solution showcases, thought leadership sessions and numerous client networking events.","We also had nearly 400 prospects in attendance and lead generation on site was nearly double the total contract value compared to last year. We believe Forum is becoming the must-attend client event of the year.","With that, let's review performance against our 2019 key shareholder priorities, which are first, continue to build high quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments. Next to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions, and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.","As mentioned, we're pleased with our second quarter's performance and strong position exiting the first half of the year. Company internal revenue growth in the quarter was 4%, including 5% growth in the Payments segment and was up 2% in the Financial segment, even in the phase of a very difficult compare.","Adjusted earnings per share was up 9% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was flat to the prior year, which was better than our expectations given the license revenue grow over.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 50 basis points sequentially. As we began to see the early signs of the tax reinvestments abating, continued scale benefits of our high quality recurring revenue and positive impact of our operational effectiveness program.","Free cash flow through June 30 was up a very strong 23% to $602 million and our free cash flow conversion was 91%, our second priority to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions.","The demand for Fiserv account processing solutions continue to be strong, but 13 wins in the quarter, six on DNA, which included a strong selling with larger credit unions. For example, low Credit Union with $1.6 billion in assets expanded their Fiserv relationship by selecting DNA and other complimentary solutions, including teller capture, item processing and Nautilus to support their growing commercial and mortgage portfolios.","In addition, highway credit union with over $1 billion in assets and velocity credit union with over $800 million in assets. Both select DNA in the quarter to utilize our modern and open technology platform to enhance their members' experiences.","Card solutions continued their strong sales signing First Mid Bank & Trust with $3.5 billion in assets to our debit processing solution in the quarter. We also added Alabama Credit Union with nearly $1 billion in assets, who selected a full suite of debit, credit, and card production services to facilitate a more integrated and enhanced member experience.","JD Bank, but more than $800 million in assets, enhanced their Fiserv relationship by selecting ATM Managed Services, one of our newest card capabilities coming from the Elan acquisition. This service will allow JD Bank to update their ATM fleet to the forefront of upcoming software and compliance mandates and better serve their customers. We've signed seven clients for ATM Managed Services and have added more than 250 institutions to the pipeline since the transaction closed last October.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Payments modernization continues to be top of mind for progressive financial institutions, which translated to five Dovetail payment hub decisions in the quarter, including Sterling National Bank for nearly $30 billion of assets.","We also signed Eastern Bank, which is one of the largest and oldest mutual banks in the country with over $11 billion in assets and locations serving communities in eastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. We signed a very large bank in the Middle East, which selected Dovetail to advance their capabilities through a single platform to process payments transactions globally. ","Lastly, First National Bank of Pennsylvania with nearly $34 billion in assets, chose our Dovetail payments platform along with our immediate funds solution as another way to drive value to their customers by supporting demand for real time access to funds and improving the overall deposit experience. We remain bullish about the strength and leadership of our full complement of end-to-end payments capabilities both now and into the future.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results.","Robert Hau","Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon. As Jeff mentioned, we feel good about our performance for the first half of the year and are in a strong position to achieve our full-year goals. Adjusted revenue was up 7% to $1.5 billion in the quarter and 6% to $2.9 billion year-to-date as a result of growth in high quality recurring revenue and new revenue from the Elan acquisition. These quarterly results were particularly encouraging given the significant prior year licensed revenue compare.","Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date, led by strong performance across our card services, electronic payments, output solutions, and account processing businesses. Foreign currency negatively impacted internal revenue growth by 20 basis points in both the quarter and year-to-date periods.","Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $470 million in the quarter and is up 5% to $927 million through June 30. Our year-to-date results include a headwind from our lending transaction that closed in Q1 of last year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was flat at 32.4% which is better than our internal expectations.","The expected decline in license revenue, the Elan acquisition and continued investments that we described in Q1 had a collective 90 basis point headwind on adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Sequentially, adjusted operating margin improved 50 basis points on stronger operating performance and lower investments.","Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was down 40 basis points to 32.1% compared to last year and it was better than our internal expectations for the period. The first half results include headwinds of more than 80 basis points, including more than 50 basis points from investments and 30 basis points from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.","The investments in client implementations and the tax reinvestment carryover expense, which we described during our first quarter earnings call, began to abate this quarter and will further moderate in the second half of the year. The acquisition impact will anniversary in the fourth quarter.","Adjusted earnings per share was up 9% to $0.82 in the quarter and increased 11% to $1.66 year-to-date, positioning us well to achieve our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","The Payment segment adjusted revenue was up 11% to $855 million in the quarter and 10% to $1.7 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth increased sequentially 120 basis points to 5% in the quarter and is up 4% year-to-date, led primarily by our card services, electronic payments and output solutions businesses.","Adjusted operating income for the Payment segment grew 12% to $303 million in the quarter and 9% to $590 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points sequentially to 35.4% in the quarter and increased 40 basis points over the prior year. The year-over-year improvement was due primarily to continued high quality revenue growth and gains in productivity, partially offset by a 60 basis point negative impact from acquisitions.","Adjusted operating margin for the first six months of the year was down 50 basis points to 34.7%, which includes pressure from the Elan transaction and the impact of first half investments which will subside in the second half of the year. Debit transactions grew high-single digits in both the quarter and year-to-date.","Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 16% in the quarter to nearly 9 million as consumers continued to embrace digital banking services. We also saw Mobiliti business clients increased 20% as commercial customers also migrate to digital experiences.","P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle, were up 100% in the quarter and grew 21% sequentially. Zelle transactions again nearly quadrupled in the quarter and the number of live clients more than doubled sequentially. We also signed nearly 60 clients in the quarter and remain enthusiastic about the growth prospects for Zelle and the positive impact it should have on the banking system.","For the financial segment, adjusted revenue was up 2% to $604 million for the quarter and for the year-to-date was generally consistent with last year at $1.2 billion, which includes the lending transaction impact, which anniversary at the end of Q1. Internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and 4% year-to-date led by our account and item processing businesses.","These results include the very difficult license revenue compare in the quarter, which shows the benefits of underlying processing revenue growth. Adjusted operating income in the financial segment was up 1% to $203 million in the quarter and for the first six months was consistent with prior year at $402 million. Adjusted operating margin was down 30 basis points to 33.7% in the quarter, primarily due to the tough compare from prior years strong license revenue.","Adjusted operating margin through June 30 was up 10 basis points to 33.5% due to growth in recurring revenue and solid operational execution. Partially offset by product investments and the difficult compare and the license revenue. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $36 million for the quarter and $65 million year-to-date, which is in line with our expectations.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% and 18.8% for the first half of the year. We've seen some additional tax benefits in the first half of the year and accordingly now expect our full-year tax rate to bias towards the lower end of our adjusted effective tax rate guidance range of 22% to 23%.","Free cash flow was strong in the quarter and was up 23% to $602 million through June 30, an increase of more than $100 million versus the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 91% for the first half of the year, which was pressured a bit by tax payments along with the timing of capital expenditures which were planned a bit heavier in the first half of the year. We continue to expect our free cash flow conversion to be at least 105% for the year.","As you know, our share repurchase program remains deferred in conjunction with the First Data of transaction. There were 393 million shares outstanding and 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at June 30. As Jeff mentioned, we have raised the funds to refinance First Data's debt with $12 billion in senior notes in June and July across multiple currencies.","We raised $9 billion of U.S. dollar debt, $1.7 billion in euro denominated notes and $1.3 billion in sterling denominated notes. These senior notes have an average tenor of 11.6 years. Including the impact of hedges the combination of the public debt along with a $5 billion term loan leads to a combined interest rate of 3.467% which is roughly $120 million lower than the expected annual interest costs at the time of the First Data transaction announcement.","Total debt outstanding as of June 30 was $13.8 billion, which includes the proceeds from the U.S. dollar portion of the debt raise. The additional US$3 billion raised in Europe was not completed until July 1. Upon closing, we expect 75% of our debt to be fixed. We had to pro forma debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.4x after netting the proceeds received in June against our total debt balance.","With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks Bob. Sales performance was up a strong 17% in the quarter and is up 14% year-to-date. We saw solid performance in several areas including our account processing businesses, card solutions and Dovetail. Sales performance has been increasing significantly up 22% over the last nine months, which we believe is especially meaningful in light of the First Data of transaction.","The domestic pipeline also remains strong and up 3% in the quarter and 11% sequentially. Integrated sales was up 22% in the quarter and it's up 4% in the first half of the year reflecting the compelling Fiserv integrated value proposition. We continued to demonstrate our operational effectiveness competency, achieving $13 million of benefits in the quarter and $25 million of savings year-to-date driven largely by procurement and labor initiatives. We are on track to meet our $50 million target and close out our five-year $250 million program of full-year early.","As for guidance, we're on track to achieve our full-year financial commitments buoyed by a stronger than anticipated first half of the year. We continue to expect our full-year internal revenue growth rate to be in a range of 4.5% to 5% and that second half growth will be moderately higher than the first.","We continue to expect adjusted her earnings per share to increase between 10% and 14% and a range of $3.39 to $3.52 for the year with a bias at\/or above the midpoint of the range. We also expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points for the year and that free cash flow conversion will be more than 105%.","Lastly, as a reminder, our 2019 guidance does not include or anticipate any impact from the First Data of transaction which we expect will close Monday. However, we will provide updated guidance for the combined company along with a very preliminary look into 2020 when we convene our third quarter call. We also expect to provide historical financial information in mid-September using our go forward accounting treatment for the combined company.","For modeling at close, we suggest you combine the guidance provided by both Fiserv and First Data in today's earnings releases and incorporate adjustments such as stock based compensation for First Data, which as you know, we include in our numbers lower interest expense. And also include a modest estimate for synergy benefits for the last five months of the year.","We expect synergies to ramp through the balance of 2019 and deliver a much larger P&L impact next year. For Fiserv historians, you may know that on July 31 we will celebrate our 35th anniversary. We're fortunate to have been part of the proud history of Fiserv and are even more excited for what we believe will be an amazing next chapter for the company.","The opportunity to partner with our clients to help them serve their customers is a compelling reason to exist. And at the same time, we've created meaningful value for shareholders, delivering more than 33,000% return since going public in 1986. And as good as that sounds, we know our success is a result of the thousands of associates who have contributed to Fiserv over the years along with the more than 24,000 current associates who come to work each day, singularly focused on delivering excellence to clients. We can't wait for the next 35 years to start.","With that operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi. Good evening, guys, and great to be joining your call for the first time. I wanted to ask a question about the rollout of contactless in the U.S. It looks, I guess tentatively like that might actually be coming. Can you just comment on how your bank customers are thinking about the rollout of contactless, meaning do they have specific plans for issuing contactless cards and on what timeline and then how do you expect that to impact your business over the next six to 12 months? Thank you.","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. Thanks Lisa, and great to have you. We are actually starting to see an uptick in demand for contactless or dual interface. We had not planned very much for that in our numbers in 2019, thinking that we would start to see that tick up in 2020 and 2021. And having contactless available in places like the New York subway, we think is helping that and obviously the brands are focused on that. So we issue about a 100 million or so payments cards or produce 100 million or so payment cards per year, we think that could actually be impactful.","We don't see it having a significant impact in 2019, but we're optimistic that we'll see that roll in certainly in 2020 and 2021 as we see that move throughout the system. The other thing that we're seeing just as interestingly is, we also do a fair amount around the prepaid providers and we're seeing the prepaid providers start to issue EMV, and we believe that a number of them will actually jump straight to contactless. So we're feeling good about that. We like that as a tailwind and we'll continue to monitor that.","Lisa Ellis","All right, terrific. Thank you.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open.","David Koning","Hey guys, thanks. Nice job.","Jeffery Yabuki","Hi, Dave. Thank you.","David Koning","So I mean, as a historian, looking back at the last 10 years, it seems like both you and First Data are putting up some of the best core underlying growth that you have. And I'm wondering, a lot of it seems company specific, both of you are doing well in the market, signing well. How much of it's just the backdrop getting better and maybe what is driving that right now?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. Thanks Dave. I mean, obviously, we are both continuing to run our companies separately and we'll continue to do that until Monday morning or we expect to continue to do that until Monday morning. I mean, we know that First Data has been making a number of investments both inside the U.S. and outside the U.S. We're just as pleased as everyone else to see GBS North America post a nice 5% number.","And the rest of the world is looking quite strong. And I think that's just a matter of seeing the cumulative effect of the work that Frank and his team have done. And it's one of the things that we talked about as you know, Dave, we really thought that there was a mismatch between the work that the team had been doing and the way that investors had been looking at that.","So from that perspective, we see that coming together, and we believe that as you put us and them into a single integrated company focused on driving innovation and excellence for clients, so that will drive incremental growth to the extent of the at least $500 million of synergies and hopefully more.","And then you're seeing on our side just the continuing aggregate effect of bringing on high quality revenue and then having some nice successes in the sales area, whether it be DNA, Architect card and then the entire digital ecosystem, so Mobiliti continues to do well. We talked about Zelle. We're seeing real momentum in Zelle and we're excited about that and we believe that that will continue for the next, probably for the next six to eight quarters.","David Koning","Okay, great. And just one, I guess follow-up. This is kind of just a financial question, but included in the guidance for standalone Fiserv, are you including that month of $12 billion or so of extra debt or is that almost like a, you're not including that in the $3.39 to $3.52 guidance?","Robert Hau","Yes. Dave, we're not including that that's a transaction related cost. So you'll see that adjusted out of the non-GAAP results.","David Koning","Great. Well, thanks guys. Nice job.","Robert Hau","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider","Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong results, and thanks for taking my question. I guess if you \u2013 I mean, Jeff, you articulated several areas on the revenue synergy side, most of which you talked about before, but in the time you've had is contemplating the transaction for over the last six months, which is maybe one or two revenue synergy items that you are most incrementally excited about or that you didn't really anticipate before. I think international you mentioned is one, which I don't recall you talking about before. Any color and that will be helpful.","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. Thanks Jim. We have been very pleased at the work that the teams have done in identifying a large categories of synergies everything from expanding the way technologies such as point-of-sale lending will look, focus on how do we help merchants get their money faster, the use of data in terms of thinking about how to make better decisions around fraud, and the like.","And then outside the U.S., one of the things that \u2013 because we were pretty small in Fiserv outside the U.S. and First Data is much larger, we've been able to take a number of the solutions that we have and move them through the, sorry, not move them through, but look at how do we move them through the First Data distribution system or the First Data network outside the U.S. So we think that's going to be interesting.","And also looking at where we have some larger clients where First Data may not trying to leverage those kinds of relationships. So I don't see us creating a lot of new innovation in terms of putting the international businesses together per se, in the base business. But we do see interesting ways that we'll invest there in the future.","James Schneider","That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe a sort of a macro comment in terms of your bank clients and what they're telling you right now. Just wondering if the, a, the change in the interest rate environment and the reversal there. And\/or b, any change in the M&A environment is impacting their spending plans as you see at heading into the back half of this year and 2020.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. It's a good question, Jim. I mean, we obviously know banks are not excited about the fact that the Fed has changed their stance on interest rates. I think it was a little bit of a foregone conclusion or it has been at least for the last quarter or so. That said, we are not seeing any change in the demand structure for the institutions that we're serving and showing up both in terms of the large event forum that we hosted back in May.","We can see it in our pipeline and then the manifestation of course in sales and the fact that \u2013 we're going to \u2013 we believe that we will achieve our full-year objectives. So that's all to say that the need to spend money on technology is not changing. You can see that in how the large banks talked in their calls and we see it and we continue to see money shifting from supporting legacy technologies to try to do some of the newer call them digital based or front end kinds of experiences.","So right now, for what we can see, we continue to feel like the spending environment remains consistent for now. We're obviously watching it closely and so that that looks in good shape. And then on the M&D front, we continue to see generally the same amount of activity as you know, when rates come down a little bit, you see banks looking more for scale and that's certainly happening.","James Schneider","Thank you.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller","Hey, thanks guys. Congrats on the \u2013 approvals on the deal closing first of all. But look you just alluded to the strong growth at First Data, especially in the merchant acquiring side. And again, I touched on this last quarter, but are these trends, the type of growth rates you guys anticipated in your deal accretion and pro forma run rate? Or are they coming in better than you thought? And then just while I'm on the topic of First Data, is there anything you can update around the JV relationship with Bams? Just given how much noise there has been in the market around it?","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure, sure. So I would say that that when we put our original models together and thought about it. I don't know that we were deeply focused on what would be happening in 2019. It was our belief that First Data had been doing things, both organically and through the allocation of capital that would show up and that we didn't believe that investors were giving First Data all the do that they should.","And I think we're seeing that manifest now and we're hopeful and strategically focused on making sure that we make the right decisions. So that will continue. So we feel - I would say that we feel quite good about the performance that we've seen to date as well as the guidance for the remainder of the year.","As it relates to the JV, I mean, obviously we've had lots and lots of questions about the JV which expires next June. Both Fiserv and First Data have long-term multi-solution relationships with Bank of America. And we have every reason to believe that's going to continue. And we know that First Data and Bank of America are continuing to work on a plan that makes sense.","What I can say is during the diligence process, we put a lot of time into understanding all of the outcomes or the likely outcomes, at least that we expected could come through that the JV. And since that point we've continued to make sure that we're working with the bank to understand what's going on and we're quite comfortable with all of the different scenarios.","And what I can say and I think this is really important, is that currently we don't anticipate a financial outcome that creates any meaningful negative impact the First Data\u2019s earnings and free cash flow for at least the next three to five years. And there were actually some scenarios in which a structural change could be accretive to the numbers, once you get past that that point in the future. So from that standpoint, we feel pretty good about that.","From a timing perspective, we do expect this issue to be better understood in the third quarter. So we think that the parties are coming together to create a situation that makes sense. I would also say very importantly that the Bank of America JV, the different outcomes that we can see, the scenarios are fully factored into our transaction accretion estimates, which as you know, is 20% to adjusted EPS in year one and 40% at the full run rate.","So Darrin, we think that that we've done the work. We think we understand the risks, the pluses and the minuses and we just don't see it having a meaningful negative impact post-closing.","Darrin Peller","That's really helpful, Jeff. Thanks. Just one quick follow-up is just, one of the exciting parts of these synergies, we were hoping for is that Clover would be cross-sold through the banks pretty quickly, given I think sort of the cloud-based approach where you guys manage the banks help, manage the banks websites. And just curious if you still think that can happen soon in terms of maybe even second half 2019 where Clover starts to be distributed in the near term.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. And Darrin we are \u2013 we set at the time and our planning teams have been working well together on the idea of bank merchant. I would say we are actually a bit more bullish today even and we were pretty bullish then, but we're even more bullish today and it's really on two vectors.","The first one is the traditional in branch, enablement of Clover. And then we're also doing some really interesting things on the digital enablement front and we fully expect that after we close on July 29 that we will be in the market and see proof points come in the second half of the year about the power of the combination in terms of providing value to the merchant customers of the banks.","Darrin Peller","Okay. That's great. Thanks guys.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Darrin.","Robert Hau","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","The next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open.","Brett Huff","Good afternoon, guys and congrats on getting closer on the deal.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Brett.","Robert Hau","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff","Question on the mix of front and back office tech spending, we've kind of heard over the last 18 months and then you guys have seen this to folks, certainly not ignoring the back office and trying to untangle the spaghetti there, but definitely shifting more towards frictionless onboarding on the front. You mentioned a little bit about that. Could you aluminate any acceleration on that side or any changes in how people are perceiving this specifically? Are there more and more banks that are now in the category of they need to do better digital onboarding and kind of how fast is that evolving?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, Brett. There is no question that the majority of the emphasis at in \u2013 really all sized institutions have been focused kind of at the edge of the bank, right. So at the point of intersection between the customers and the financial institution and creating, whether it be digital onboarding or any kind of digitization of the variety of financial experiences that that customers engage in with their institution. So that's been a big piece of the focus.","What we are seeing is, and we announced one of the proof points of it today was around our Dovetail, our market leading payment hub technology. We had I think five signings in the core in the quarter and that's really about enabling pieces of the back office. So think about it as payments modernization to keep up with going well what the real-time right now world that's happening at the edge.","And so we are seeing a lot of exploration into that, call it the end to end that's necessary to ultimately deliver those experiences to the retail and the commercial customers and the small business customers of the bank.","So we are seeing that happening. If you said, is it more about the using your words to spaghetti or more about the experience. It's more about the experience. But I will say that that the need to bring the solutions together is making its way back into some of the infrastructure and turning kind of some of the legacy into more modern systems. And that's going to take a long time to get done. But that's where we see people into RFPs and taking a look at what do we need to do serve, you see more end-to-end on that front.","Brett Huff","That's helpful. And the follow-up, another kind of product question is, I and I think others are excited about having a couple of these big mega deal companies kind of own, if you will, the relationship both on the funding account on the consumer side, the DDA, and then the merchant point-of-sale, and seeing maybe some interesting near-term easy wins to make transactions more frictionless, but maybe also a little more science fiction down the road. Now that you've studied this combination for awhile, can you talk any more about how you're seeing those opportunities evolve?","Jeffery Yabuki","And Brett, obviously, you know, you've known us for a long time. You know, that's one of the areas that we've been focused on really since back to 2012 when we bought CashEdge to really accelerate our focus on P2P through Popmoney, and obviously now Zelle. I mean, we're very, very excited about the opportunity to use, you called it the funding account, the transactional account as a way for consumers to interact with any of their providers in a more frictionless way. And I think that's going to manifest in a variety of different forms over the next several years. And for us, we just want to make sure that we're in this.","We think the scale of First Data with kind of roughly 40% of the merchant footprint and the scale of Fiserv with over a 100 million transaction accounts. We like that. We liked the optionality, and we're excited to work with our partners, with the financial institutions and ultimately with some corporates to see what's out there, that can deliver better service. I think for now, we're really studying that. We'll be able to study it a lot closer once we close, but we're very excited about that and we're going to continue to plant flags around areas like Zelle because we think that is one of the differentiators to make some of that. I think you called it science fiction. Some of that actually happened.","Brett Huff","Great. That's what I needed. Thanks for the time.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you.","Robert Hau","Thanks Brett.","Operator","And the next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Ramsey El-Assal","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about revenue synergies more than the context of timing. Now that you've had a little time to dig in and look under the hood, what is your kind of most updated thinking on which specific opportunities are most kind of realizable or in the near-term sort of quickly realizable understanding that you're the bulk of the benefit we'll see probably in 2020 rather than 2019? Which opportunities feel the most sort of readily achievable?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. I mean it is, when we had talked about this originally, we talked about kind of the payments and network, innovation opportunities playing an important role in the near-term, call it over the next 12 to 18 months. We are going to be very, very focused on selling. I mean we're excited to have a chance to get out of the blocks a little bit faster than we thought. We think base merchant is a very good opportunity in the near-term and the reality is, is that we have businesses like our Biller Solutions business where we do a little part of the overall acquiring with these providers and being able to bring First Data in and having them be able to bring us in.","We see a lot of, we call it integrated sales, but a lot of real high value cross-sell that can move pretty quickly. Again, we won't know until we hit the. That the problem that we have to the extent that there is a timing problem is as you know, Ramsey, we have to sell it and then we have to implement it and then it has to go live. We like to thank merchant. We think some of those things can happen quickly. Some of the network and payments opportunities we think can happen quickly. And so we see those to be a little bit faster than the others, but we're going to be focused on that and you'll hear us talk about how we're doing on that each and every quarter.","Ramsey El-Assal","Great. Just one follow-up I wanted to ask about the industry more broadly. It just seems like the Universe is scaling up through your M&A, what's your view on how this broader processing industry looks in five years? Do you think this space just continues to really dramatically pull up, so even players with the scale that you guys are sort of amassing, or get larger and larger and larger, or do you think there's some measure of stability that we've achieved with these kind of specific deals kind of having been consummated recently?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. It's a really great question. And I fear that we won't have time to go fully back and forth. I would say that if you would've asked many of the industry participants that you're referring to five years ago, they would've thought that five years later that the industry would have taken the steps that it had taken, I suspect that people would say no, and certainly you asked how quickly, if it all changed, I think you would get an absolute, you've got to be kidding me.","From our perspective, we see opportunities to deploy capital every single day, but it's important for us to stay really focused on one of the key drivers to the more than 33,000% return we've had over the last 33 years as a public company. And that's making sure we're allocating capital to drive value for shareholders. So we're going to remain focused on \u2013 what the capital allocation strategy that we've used.","And if there occasionally there's something meaningful to do, we'll certainly consider it. But we see lots of ways to drive value without having to do major scale transactions. I think we'll have to see how they come together over the next few years. We're just really, really focused on how do we drive as much cash flow for shareholders that we can and make sure we deploy that capital to build the most value possible.","Ramsey El-Assal","Very helpful. Thanks.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question is from Daniel Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Daniel Perlin","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Jeffery Yabuki","Hi, Dan.","Daniel Perlin","How are you doing?","Jeffery Yabuki","Okay.","Daniel Perlin","I had a question about the kind of the fintechs and payments and really other areas increasingly becoming these kind of quasi deposit gatherers. And here I'm thinking like a square's debit and been mode's debit card where they're clearly trapping cash now where they used to let it kind of be more of a straight through process with these entities. And so I'm just wondering, Jeff, when you look at your portfolio, what are the \u2013 one of the products or services that you've created to help kind of come back those competitive threats for your bank today?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, it's really \u2013it's an interesting time and whether you're talking about the Chimes, or the N26s and lots of other things that are going on, whether they be traditional banks or non-traditional banks, PayPal of course. And I put Venmo as hero example of what has to happen to make sure that the deposit balances are being trapped in the banks. I think that's one of them.","I think to the extent that we can make sure that we are enabling more commerce to happen at point of sale and whether that be through better decisioning models or point of sale lending, right, credit of being available at the point of thought, those kinds of things so that consumers don't go to other places. I think the whole intersection of digital experience, better decisions based on data.","I think we'll see that become very important. Venmo is a little bit of a capsule and what can you put in it and around it to make sure not Venmo, I'm sorry Zelle, what do you put around that to make sure that it's driving value for the financial institution clients and that the other thing is I think that you see us as part of the $0.5 billion that we're going to invest. I think you'll see a fair amount of that go to the points of intersection between financial experience, commerce and making sure that banks are winning with their deposit gathering.","Daniel Perlin","That's great. The follow-up question I had is \u2013 the $120 million of interest savings that you just talked about on the financing. Just philosophically how should we be thinking about that? Are you planning on letting that flow through into the pro forma model early or are you viewing that opportunity as away in which to invest more quickly in this transactions integration? Thank you.","Robert Hau","Yes, Dan. It\u2019s Bob. I would look at it as an opportunity to grow our earnings per share. From a standpoint of invest back in the company, we're certainly planning to appropriately invest as needed to get at the synergies as well \u2013 both on the cost and the revenue standpoint. And that's fully baked into the model. As Jeff pointed out in the prepared remarks, we're very comfortable that we will achieve the at least 20% earnings accretion in year one and 40% at full run rate synergies. That $120 million of lower interest certainly helps with that. It also generates some cash flow, allows us to pay debt down faster and get back into share repurchase.","Daniel Perlin","Fantastic. Thank you.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research Company. Your line is now open.","Matthew O'Neill","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My only question at this point really is just a follow-up, I think to Darrin's question earlier around the BAMS JV and how that that process is going? I know, it's still a little premature for you guys to talk about it. One thing, Jeff though that you said that I was hoping I could just glean some more color from was that there'd be no impact for three to five years.","Is there any kind of read through to that that there's view that the ownership, percentage might come down and maybe some discussion on the exclusivity ending and so certain merchants might be rolling off? Is there contracts kind of expire over that sort of three to five year phase or was that just a \u2013 this is how far we can sort of confidently see into the future for now and we'll update you more is we hear how the deal progresses?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, Matt and thanks for asking the follow-up. So what I was trying to say is, for at least the next three to five years and it really is a matter of, it's hard to look that far into the future in a scenario that is not fully baked. But there's no cliff at the end of that. It's just a matter of saying, we think that should give investors confidence that there's nothing to really worry about at this stage.","And that as the ultimate facts come to light. We'll work very cooperatively with \u2013 and no matter what the scenario is to make sure that that both sides are being optimized in what they're doing. And I do think one of the unique things here is, this is not \u2013 this arrangement, no matter how it ends up playing out. It's not a win lose scenario. It's going to be a win-win scenario. And everyone feels like that's been the case. Obviously, we haven't been in the direct conversations, but that that's really the outcomes that are being driven here.","Matthew O'Neill","Got it. Thank you very much. And then just as a final follow-up on that if I can. Has there been any sort of cross discussion with Bank of America regarding the CheckFree relationship, which I think is next up and maybe 2023, I suspect not, but figured too?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, and we just to be even more blunt. We have not had any direct conversations with the bank. We are operating as separate companies on the joint venture discussion and there hasn't on for Fiserv, there hasn't been any specific conversation pointing out that. We have a very good relationship with the bank on that front and we're always looking to make sure that we're helping Bank of America to continue to be the number one digital bank in the U.S. and that's an important part of it strategy.","Matthew O'Neill","Thanks a lot. I'll leave it there. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi. Good afternoon. Good to talk to you. Jeff, you mentioned and highlighted a Dovetail as part of Fiserv's real time payments, infrastructure offerings and efforts. Bill pay is a product that or service that is back in the news these days. And I wonder if you can just elaborate on how you think that market's evolving, whether or not the consolidator model maybe can clawbacks some share from biller direct and to what extent if any, the merger maybe adds value, and helps you accelerate that shift or drive more bill pay volume across your platform?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. Thanks for the question. That's actually one of my favorite topics. It is an interesting thing because your point of it's a little bit, kind of a little bit in the rear view in terms of people talking about it is so interesting because you see all kinds of people trying to get into the business and you wonder, well, why are they trying to do that?","And I think they're trying to do that because we all understand that the ability to facilitate payments for a consumer or for a small business, especially through this consolidated model, is way more convenient than website hopping to make that happen.","The key is, is how do you bring in the biller merchant in \u2013 the biller and merchant information to make that experience top notch. The other piece of it is ultimately having real time, money, movement, real time payment that you can consistently and constantly use across all kinds of billers, is I think the next big twist and the next big point that's going to change that value proposition.","And so again, we're working with a number of our partners. It's one of the things that we're very excited about the work with First Data. We think they've got a lot of interesting connectivity to make that happen. And I do think that it may take longer than people understand, but you're going to see bill payment be at the front of real time consumer payments.","And so whether you're using your illustrative hypothetical wallet to make a bill payment in real time, or to engage in commerce in real time, or to make a P2P payment in real time. I think you're going to see that come together. And it's one of the reasons why technologies such as Dovetail are so important as you see new clearings coming online especially here in the U.S.","Andrew Jeffrey","And as a follow-up to that. I always appreciate your insight on the subject. As a follow-up, do you see debit cards generally, or even in specific verticals playing more of a role in bill payment? Or do you think sort of direct ACH bill pay is going to be the \u2013 is still going to be sort of ubiquitous? ","Robert Hau","Again, this is a little bit of the world according to Jeff and I want to make sure that I'm clear about that. If you think about the card space as a pan-based space, right, the 16-digit number, and then you think about the transactional account as an account number model. I see them both having pluses and minuses. The connectivity to the debit card implies speed, real time, safety and securely. And I think that matters. And so figuring out how to bring them together, I think is an interesting way to look at it.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thanks a lot.","Robert Hau","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Kartik Mehta","Hey Jeff. Jeff, I wanted to ask you a little bit about share repurchase. When you look at after the companies combined, are there benchmarks that you're looking as in, is it strictly a leverage ratio issue? Is it that you've achieved a certain amount of cost savings? Is it that you've invested so much money? Is it what the economy is doing? What's the decision point for you to go back in the market and kind of do what Fiserv has always done, which is return a ton of capital back to shareholders?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. Thanks for asking that question, Kartik primarily because this was the first quarter, I think in my entire tenure where we were unable to buyback a share of stock. And I don't \u2013 for people who know Fiserv and know me, that's not what we aspire to do. So our objective is to look at our leverage ratios, to paydown debt to grow EBITDA and to deploy the capital that we're going to create the $4 billion or so of free cash flow that we're going to have a few years out, so that we can make sure that we're building shareholder value in a way that we have or consistent with how we have over the last, at least the last 14 or 15 years.","And it'll also obviously depend on our valuation and everything else and we'll continue to use the same methodology that we have historically. And so the real answer is, we'll do it as quickly as we can. As you know, we did not suspend our program. We deferred it, and so I would expect us to get into the market as soon as we have the right level of comfort that we've met our commitments to the rating agencies and that we can build shareholder value effectively and efficiently and consistently.","Kartik Mehta","And just one last one, Jeff. As you look at your community and regional bank customers, as you know, they're dealing with the net interest margin squeeze possibly, but they're also dealing with investing in all these digital solutions, but unable to get rid of some of the other legacy solutions cost continued to increase for them. How do you see them managing that and do you anticipate that the investment that they're continuing to make will \u2013 that they will be able to do so in the future?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. I mean there is a bit of a squeeze in the community bank space or whether they be banks or credit unions in the community financial institutions space for the reasons that you're mentioning. And I think one of the opportunities for us is to build products and solutions that that will allow these institutions to take advantage of digital, which is a more cost effective way to interact, but also to build revenue.","It's one of the reasons why we're even more excited today about the bank merchant opportunity because we think we can see a lot of white space out there, where community-based financial institutions are not optimizing the amount of merchant revenue that they can create. And we're looking at how do we help systemically using our technology to better optimize revenue.","So it's a combination of how do we create more revenue, there are certainly going to be \u2013 there's going to be always pressure on costs as there have been for the entire 35 years of our existence. And then lastly, it really is about how do you use this digital ecosystem to be more efficient? I think that's the Trifecta that we're at least focused on.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you. Appreciate it. ","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Kartik.","Operator","The next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open.","Glenn Greene","Thanks. My questions have actually been answered, so thanks and congrats on the close.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Glenn.","Robert Hau","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","The next question is from Timothy Willi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Timothy Willi","Thanks and good afternoon. Just a housekeeping question around the balance sheet and sort of a discussion around debt and interest. So I think you said you did $12 billion of notes across variety of currencies. First Data had roughly $7 billion. Could you just sort of any insights around that $5 billion gap in terms of that that's where the priority to pay down first or if there's possibly some other activity that will happen regarding that that we should think about?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes, Tim. Thanks for the question. We have arranged a $5 billion bank term loan that will round out the $17 billion we need to refinance. So the combination of that $5 billion a term loan and the $12 billion of notes that we raised in late June, early July will cover the full $17 billion needed.","Timothy Willi","Okay, awesome. Thanks so much for clarifying.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yep.","Robert Hau","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Our last question will be from Vasundhara Govil with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is now open.","Vasundhara Govil","Hi, thanks. I appreciate you guys squeezing me in last minute. I wanted to extend my congratulations for getting all the approvals.","Jeffery Yabuki","Okay.","Vasundhara Govil","Jeff, I just wanted to follow-up on the discussion regarding international synergies before. Did you elaborate a little bit on what type of products you are focused on there? Are we thinking about potentially setting core banking products in deforested as distribution outside or more on the payment side? And then if you could also talk about what kind of capital investments might be acquired to enable that?","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. So I would say \u2013 right now we have one core banking platform called Signature that we sell outside the U.S. We also have a \u2013 we also sell that inside the U.S. And so we'll continue to focus on that. But really we're most excited about leveraging the existing First Data footprint to try to go-to-market with some of our digital products, which we have a good footprint around the world.","Dovetail, we're very excited about Dovetail payment hubs. The modernization of the payments ecosystem is happening actually more rapidly outside the U.S. and inside the U.S. and Dovetail was a UK company, when we acquired it with most of their presence outside the U.S. and so for us, gaining more distribution is a great example.","We also have some strong cash oriented products, risk products, some fraud products, data warehousing, a number of different products that we can just add on or hopefully add onto the relationships that we have and we don't see those being significant investments.","The other thing that we have is First Data has a nice footprint of data centers outside the U.S. We don't have out data centers outside the U.S. and the ability to take some of our products and not just deliver them on a licensed basis, but deliver them on a hosted basis, will allow us to build not just revenue, but really the high quality recurring revenue that we strive to deliver.","Vasundhara Govil","Thank you. That's very helpful.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you.","Jeffery Yabuki","And thank you everyone for joining us today. We always appreciate your support and we're really excited to come Monday to close the transaction with First Data, and start the new Fiserv. So thanks everyone.

Thank you ","Peter Poillon","Thanks, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. With me today is Jeff Yabuki, our Chairman and Chief Executive; Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. ","Our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. ","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from our recent acquisitions of First Data. ","Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.","Please refer to our materials for today\u2019s call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. ","Also note that non-GAAP financial measures included in our earnings release and supplemental materials include the full quarter and year-to-date results for First Data, which have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information. ","For additional historical combined financial information, please refer to the Form 8-K which we filed on October 3. ","Finally, please mark your calendar for our Investor Day to be held on March 25 in New York City. We look forward to seeing you for this important event. ","And now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. ","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to be with you today as we share our first quarter of combined results along with our insights and enthusiasm for the future of your company. ","Financial performance is off to an excellent start following the July 29 close of the First Data transaction, led by strong internal revenue growth, expanding adjusted operating margin and growing free cash flow. Synergy work is progressing well and sales momentum continues to be strong. This performance contributed to increasing our internal revenue growth guidance to 6% for the year and adjusted EPS growth of 16% to 17%, setting us up for an even better 2020. ","Although we are a larger more dynamic enterprise, we remain fully committed to delivering upon the key tenants of shareholder value that have underpinned our performance for more than a dozen years. High quality revenue growth, operating margin expansion, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation are alive and well in new Fiserv. Along those lines, we reinitiated our share repurchase program late in the third quarter under a 10b5 plan. We are confident in our ability to both meet our debt repayment commitments and repurchase shares. ","The integration of First Data is top of mind as we focus on building a great company. Yesterday was day 100 of this transformational merger and we're really excited about the road ahead. Energy is high, teams are coming together and our integration activities are progressing well. Creating success for our clients is number one on our integration agenda and foundational to the promise of this combination. ","As I mentioned upfront, we're off to a great start financially with internal revenue growth in the quarter up more than 6% led by a very strong 10% in our GBS merchant business and adjusted earnings per share was up 17% to $1.02. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 130 basis points to 29.8% and free cash flow was more than $800 million. For the year-to-date, internal revenue growth was also 6% with GBS up again 10% for the period. Adjusted earnings per share was up 16% to $2.87 and adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points to 29.1%. ","Free cash flow through September 30 was 13% -- was up 13% to just over $2.3 billion and free cash flow conversion was excellent at 116%. We continue to be intently focused on growing high quality free cash flow and allocating that capital in a way that optimizes value creation on both an overall and on a per share basis. ","Now before I turn the call to Frank to update you on integration and synergy progress, let me share a few proof points on how the combination extends and enriches our strategic position. Account processing is a critically important business which also provides a strategic hub to further distribute high quality solutions in a cost effective manner such as our new offerings around merchant services. Along those lines, we were pleased to sign another 14 core account processing clients in the quarter, including six on DNA and have signed 41 clients year-to-date. ","We will continue to invest in enabling our account processing clients to serve their customers in a real time digitally-focused world. Unlocking client value and expanding growth across our market leading merchant acquiring business is one of our highest priorities. Our cloud based, point of sale platform Clover crossed the $100 billion threshold in annualized payment volume in the quarter, a more than 40% gain over last year. Add-on Clover services are growing rapidly and payment devices shipped is up 25% through September 30. We're also seeing significant growth opportunities across our e-commerce merchant business which on top of strong sales grew transactions more than 30% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Additionally, our integrated payments ISP partners expanded by more than 20% in the quarter. We're incredibly optimistic about the future growth potential in these digitally-centric merchant businesses. ","A key strategic focus is to extend our position as the largest merchant acquirer in the world. The combination of a highly advantaged bank merchant opportunity, rapidly accelerating growth in digital commerce, global distribution and the continued strength of our Clover platform positions us to further expand market share in this important space. ","The market continues to embrace payments innovation as the new norm. We believe our scale with more than 1 billion payment cards enforced and leadership positions in areas such as card network, electronic bill payment, ACH and Zelle combine to create meaningful growth today and optionality for tomorrow.","Last, we have a significant opportunity to meaningfully participate in global franchise growth. Whether looking at cash to card payments in India, gaining acceptance share in Brazil and Argentina or enabling more e-commerce in Europe, we are more holistically participating in the long tail of global growth. As a complement, we've identified a series of meaningful revenue synergy opportunities outside the U.S. further leveraging the solution breadth and processing scale of the combined company. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Frank. ","Frank Bisignano","Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here as part of the new Fiserv. As we mentioned earlier, we're only a 100 days into this transformational merger of two great companies. And I am even more energized today as we dive into the business and see the wide range of opportunities ahead. ","Let me first start by stating that the power of this new company has far greater reach than I imagined when we decided to put it together. That conclusion is derived from the many senior level client meetings we've had, and how well the value proposition comes together in the clients\u2019 office. We've established business units led by exceptional management teams, comprised of leaders from both companies. As you can imagine, Jeff and I carefully considered each of the leadership positions across our businesses, and put together the team which we believe will drive great results around the world. ","As you may know, I, along with the senior members of our team have had the firsthand opportunity to work on some of the more transformational mergers in the financial services industry. And we're utilizing those experiences to help ensure we execute extraordinarily well. The team\u2019s engagement model and partnership is at the very highest level I've ever seen and with a clear determination to build a great global company for the long-term benefit of clients, associates and shareholders. ","When two large and complex companies come together is essentially associates, the lifeblood of the company is highly engaged on two fronts; the business as usual operation of the company, and successful execution of the full set of integration activities. We are thrilled at how well the people of both companies have come together to focus on what matters. We're pleased with our progress on revenue synergies and confident that we will at a minimum meet the $500 million target including nearly $100 million of synergy revenue next year. Currently, we have 78 work streams in process across the company focused on delivering additional client value.","In addition to near-term value, we're also thinking about how the payments industry may evolve over the longer-term, and how we, as an industry leader can use our unique combination of assets to drive sustainable, profitable growth beyond the synergy work today. As we mentioned, one of the most important revenue synergies is to better serve the account processing client base of the original Fiserv through distributing high quality merchant acquiring solutions. ","Enabling technologies such as Clover to be distributed digitally and through the physical branch network of original Fiserv clients is a significant opportunity which is literally being validated daily. We have already signed more than 20 core account processing clients, with about half being competitive takeaways. Of the competitive wins, five had assets raising from $1 billion to $6 billion, and there are more than 200 financial institutions in the pipeline. Enabling clients to enhance the relationship with their most important clients while delivering much needed fee revenue is resonating as a very compelling value proposition. ","Based on the market reaction, we now expect to exceed the $200 million revenue synergy opportunity we originally identified for this initiative. We're also making excellent progress on our network routing and card issuing revenue opportunities, which is extending existing card and network relationships along with identifying ways to create incremental market differentiation. The combination of Star and Accel further enhances our position as the third largest network in the U.S. with important issuer and merchant clients. ","In addition, with more than $1 billion active credit and debit cards globally, we have an opportunity to innovate in new and unique ways. We have identified a meaningful number of revenue synergies outside the U.S. which go beyond our original revenue thesis. In addition to delivering merchant and issuing services globally, we're seeing momentum in areas such as payments modernization, core banking, digital solutions and risk with an important emphasis in providing hosted solution through our scaled infrastructure throughout the world. ","We have also identified numerous opportunities to provide additional solutions to clients in which one or both of the original firms have an influential relationship. As I mentioned, we had the pleasure to meet with the number of clients and in each meeting there has been substantial discussion about how Fiserv can deliver additional value as a result of the combination. ","We have completed an in-depth white space opportunity analysis for our largest clients and are very optimistic about what the future holds for delivering incremental client value and revenue growth. ","Moving to cost synergies, we are making excellent progress against our objectives of at least $900 million over the first five years, which as you know does not include interest savings. Like revenue, our internal objective is to surpass that goal in terms of both dollars and time to achieve. Our initial focus has been to identify duplicate costs across the company with an emphasis on our corporate and technology functions. We're off to a great start with high visibility and action plans in place to achieve our objective. Our goal is to streamline our overall cost structure while delivering more compelling and even higher quality solutions to our clients. ","We're also leveraging the global product development captive Fiserv built to extend the productivity of our resources while reducing overall costs. One of the larger cost synergy opportunities is design efficiency and effectiveness across our more than $4 billion of annual vendor strength. We're methodically meeting with our suppliers and engaging in productive conversations which we believe will contribute meaningfully to our cost synergy objectives. ","We have created a strong focus in governance structure to ensure we achieve our synergy objectives. With have actioned over $200 million in annualize saves against our $900 million cost target. Importantly, we expect that level to grow every week increasing the probability of outperformance over the period.","As you've heard we're highly confident in achieving our synergy targets and have an additional focus on overachieving in terms of quantum and timing. We will supply a full update including any increases to our target at our March Investor Day. ","We also are evaluating the best way to deploy the incremental $500 million innovation investment pool to create market differentiation and drive additional revenue growth beyond synergies. We are evaluating a variety of opportunities in areas such as digital commerce, card payments, risk and fraud solutions and network innovation. We will also share more on this important initiative with you in March.","Let me also provide a quick update on our progress with BAMS joint venture. As we discussed on our July 30th call, we're working with the bank collaboratively through a well defined contractual process to dissolve the JV in June 2020 and ensure we deliver great service to our shared clients. We continue to believe that Fiserv\u2019s results will be accretive over the next few years as we leverage the significant scale within the company. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide detail on our financial results. ","Bob Hau","Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon. Let me start by calling your attention to four items included in our reported results and reflected in the Form 8-K filed on October 3. First, internal revenue growth will be reported on a constant currency basis consistent with the First Data methodology. For clarity, we have not made any FX adjustments to EBITDA which is different than how FDC had reported nor to operating income or adjusted EPS. Next, First Data previously added back stock-based compensation in reporting its adjusted earnings metrics. We now conform to our practice of including stock-based compensation in the adjusted income statement. Third, First Data previously reported adjusted revenue for its joint ventures using proportional consolidation. Beginning with this quarter results for minority owned jointed ventures will mirror GAAP and no longer be reflected in adjusted revenue and adjusted operating income. ","Our share of the net income from these JVs is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. We will continue to report BAMS using proportional consolidation as we believe that approach best reflects how we will report the results of this business upon dissolution. ","Finally, we're reporting our adjusted results across four segments. First Data which reflects First Data\u2019s historic business segments; payments and financial, which are original Fiserv\u2019s two business segments; and last, we combine both companies\u2019 corporate segments into a single item. We will report our results in this fashion for the remainder of the year and expect to roll out a new segment structure beginning in 2020. ","We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the first nine months of the year and are well positioned to achieve strong full year financial performance. Adjusted revenue was up 5% to $3.6 billion in the quarter and 4% to $10.7 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was a strong 6% in both the quarter and year-to-date driven by all three business segments delivering higher growth through September 30. ","As expected, revenue synergies were modest in the quarter and will accelerate over time. Overall, internal revenue growth performance through September 30th is slightly ahead of our expectations for the year. Adjusted operating income increased 10% to $1.1 billion in the quarter and is up 8% to $3.1 billion through the first nine months of the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 29.8%, up 130 basis points versus the prior year. ","As you know, we had expected stronger margin performance in the second half of the year in the original Fiserv business as we lap much of the prior-year tax reinvestments. Operating margin also benefited by increased revenue growth and some limited benefit from cost synergies, partially offset by the Elan acquisition. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points to 29.1% with each of the segments showing increases. Given the July 29 close, actual synergy benefits realized in the quarter were modest. Revenue synergy action plans are on track to achieve our year one target of nearly $100 million and we've already actioned annualized run rate cost synergies of more than $200 million. We are highly confident that we will meet or exceed both the revenue and cost synergy targets. ","Now keep in mind that interest savings are not included in the $900 million cost synergy target. The total of target cost synergies and the expected interest savings is in excess of $1.1 billion annually. Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% to $1.02 in the quarter and increased 16% to $2.87 year-to-date. These results included a negative impact from foreign currency of $0.02 and $0.08 per share for the third quarter and year-to-date respectively. ","Overall, we are very well positioned to achieve our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In the First Data segment, adjusted revenue was up 3% to $2.2 billion for the quarter and up 2% through September 30th to $6.4 billion. These results for both periods include headwinds from last year's Q3 divestitures. Segment internal revenue growth was a strong 7% in both the quarter and year-to-date and is up more than 100 basis points compared to last year. This performance included excellent results in the former GBS segment recording 10% growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. These results also include 7% growth in the quarter for GBS North America and 6% growth for the year-to-date. ","The primary drivers of our strong growth are digital commerce, ISV Solutions, Clover and global merchant acquiring. For example, ISV revenues have grown more than 60% year-to-date and we've added more than 18,000 new ISV merchants. Overall, contracted merchant locations globally, both digital and physical, have expanded low-double-digits this year. ","In card issuer processing, we are seeing solid trends in global credit card accounts on file, which grew mid-single-digits in the quarter. This growth was driven primarily by the on-boarding of new clients and growth in existing portfolios. FTC had previously treated plastics resale revenue as a pass-through item. Given that original Fiserv provides plastics production, this is now included as adjusted revenue. This reporting change created a headwind in Q3 and becomes a bit more pronounced in the fourth quarter. ","International growth continues to be a bright spot, delivering high teens internal revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date. And growth has come from a combination of new issuing and merchant business with strong payment macros in places such as Brazil and India. The First Data segment adjusted operating income increased 5% to $667 million in the quarter and is up 4% to $1.9 billion through the first nine months of the year. ","Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 20 basis points to 30.7% in the quarter, driven primarily by strong revenue growth and cost containment offset by pressure from foreign currency. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points to 30.3%. As we enter 2020, we don't plan to separately report the former First Data segment or sub-segment growth rates. As we provide new segments, we'll supply the key financial and business metrics, which we believe best align with our strategic plans and expected financial results. ","Moving to the Payments segment, which is original Fiserv only, adjusted revenue was up 11% in both the quarter and year-to-date to $861 million and $2.5 billion respectively, including the benefit of the Elan acquisition. ","Internal revenue growth was 6% in the quarter, up more than 100 basis points sequentially and up 5% year-to-date, led primarily by strong performance in our card services, electronic payments and output solutions businesses. Adjusted operating income for the Payments segment grew 16% to $309 million in the quarter and 11% to $899 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 35.9%, up 150 basis points over the prior year and adjusted operating margin for the first nine months was up 10 basis points to 35.3%. ","Results in the quarter and year-to-date benefited from additional revenue growth and the reduction of last year's tax funded investments, partially offset by the impact of the Elan acquisition, which anniversaried on October 31st. Debit transactions grew high-single-digits in both the quarter and year-to-date. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 14% in the quarter to 9 million and Mobiliti business clients increased 18% as the U.S. continues to embrace digital banking services. ","P2P transactions, which includes both Popmoney and Zelle continued to show strong results doubling versus Q3 last year and up 15% sequentially. Zelle transactions alone nearly tripled in the quarter, buoyed by the number of live clients nearly doubling sequentially. We signed 130 Zelle clients in the quarter, more than the first two quarters of the year combined and almost 3 times the number signed in Q3 last year. ","For the Financial segment, adjusted revenue was up 4% to $596 million for the quarter and up 1% to $1.8 billion year-to-date, including the lending transaction, which anniversaried at the end of Q1. Internal revenue growth in this segment was 4% in the third quarter, up more than 100 basis points sequentially, and is 4% year-to-date led by our account and item processing businesses. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment grew 5% to $196 million in the quarter and is up 1% to $598 million through the first nine months of the year. ","Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 20 basis points in the quarter to 32.9% and up 10 basis points year-to-date to 33.3%. The results in the quarter and year-to-date are stronger than they appear, given a reduction in periodic revenue, which has been more than offset by the benefit of high-quality recurring revenue growth and operational efficiency. The adjusted corporate operating loss, which includes the combined corporate expenses of both original businesses, was $93 million for the quarter and $314 million year-to-date. Now we expect the fourth quarter corporate expenses to be generally consistent with that of Q3. ","The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.2% for the quarter, and is 20.8% for the first nine months of the year. And we expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be 24% and our full year adjusted tax rate to be about 22%. You may recall First Data has a meaningful tax NOL, which should create a -- continue to create a lower cash tax rate for the next several quarters. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter and is up 13% to $2.3 billion year-to-date with free cash flow conversion of 116%. ","As a result of our normal portfolio management process, we reached agreement to divest two small product lines for $133 million in the quarter. These businesses represent about $8 million of revenue per quarter and both closed in October. We issued 286 million shares on July 29th to complete the First Data transaction. ","And in late September, we began repurchasing shares in line with our longstanding capital deployment strategy. We repurchased 341,000 shares for about $35 million in the quarter and 2 million shares for approximately $156 million year-to-date. We have 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. ","We remain fully committed to returning to our historic leverage level over the next 18 to 24 months through a combination of debt repayment and strong EBITDA growth. Total debt outstanding as of September 30th, which is about 75% fixed, was $22.5 billion and debt-to-EBITDA was 3.9 times. ","With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. ","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks, Bob. We begin our new Fiserv journey with a far larger opportunity to deliver value to the market. Combined sales performance was up 15% in the quarter and is up 8% year-to-date. We had a number of important wins in the quarter such as signing the California DMV and its 180 locations to the Clover platform. We also had larger competitive wins in the integrated payment space such as Dash platform, Smart Service and MRI. And we added all the North and all the South to global supermarket chain store with locations across 19 markets to our e-commerce solutions. ","We were also pleased to expand our relationship with Golden 1 Credit Union in the quarter with a bundle of new value, including ATM Managed Services. We signed Western Alliance Bank with more than $25 billion in assets and TBK Bank with nearly $5 billion of assets to our dovetail payment hub. And last, DNA momentum continued in the quarter signing six new clients and competitive processes, including Landmark Credit Union, Wisconsin's largest credit union with more than $4.2 billion in assets, and Verve, a credit union with about $1.3 billion in assets. ","Our sales pipeline remains strong and importantly, the weighted pipeline of revenue synergies is approaching $100 million of annual revenue. We expect the synergy pipeline and related sales to grow as the market experiences the new Fiserv. For those tracking the original Fiserv, integrated sales was up 46% in the quarter and 17% through September 30th.","Operational effectiveness performance remained on track with $11 million achieved in the quarter and $36 million of savings year-to-date. ","Now on to guidance. We expect constant currency internal revenue growth of 6% for the year with the fourth quarter coming in around 5%, due primarily to a slightly better-than-expected Q3, a tough prior year compare, including lower periodic revenue in our Financial segment and some purchase revenue adjustments. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.98 to $4.02 for the year, growth of 16% to 17%, which includes more than 300 basis points of negative impact from FX on our full year adjusted EPS growth rate. We expect adjusted operating margins to expand by at least 100 basis points for the year, and that free cash flow conversion will be approximately 115%. ","Although we are in the midst of our 2020 planning, we will provide a very preliminary view into our expected performance. For full clarity, this is not official guidance or outlook. Those data will be provided in our February call. As of today, considering the strong performance of the existing business, expected synergies and the current view into the continuing headwind from FX, we anticipate 2020 internal revenue growth of at least 7% and that adjusted earnings per share will grow plus or minus 25% over 2019's actual performance. ","This has been a monumental year for Fiserv. We were named the World's Most Admired Company for the sixth year in a row, celebrated our 35th anniversary, and most importantly, combined with First Data to help achieve our aspiration of moving money and information in a way that moves the world. And while others have followed our lead, we are even more confident today that our solution set, global scale and significant investment capacity underpins an unparalleled opportunity for clients, associates and shareholders. ","Let us also thank our 44,000 associates around the world for their commitment and enthusiasm to building our new enterprise while continuing to serve clients with excellence. Each of you working together are truly Fiserv at our best. ","With that, Michelle, let's open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from David Koning with Baird. You may go ahead, sir. ","David Koning ","Yes. And maybe to start out, I mean, to have guidance over 7% for next year, what seems like is happening is First Data has kind of gone from a few years ago losing share to actually -- it seems like they're gaining share now. And you guys kind of called out digital ISV Clover Global Solutions all that fast growth stuff. Is North America actually kind of in an acceleration mode? And maybe how big is the really fast growth part now? Has that gotten to scale that it can accelerate the total North America growth now? ","Jeff Yabuki ","So Dave, there's a lot of questions that are in there. Let me take the first part of it, and then have Frank fill 1in the blanks and perhaps Bob will have something to add to it as well. I would say that if you start kind of at a little bit more of a macro level, you'll remember when we got on the phone in -- on January 16th and announced the transaction, that it was our belief that there was a mismatch between what was going on in the company and how investors were thinking and what we were seeing. And what we are seeing was that Frank and the management team had really put the company on the right path that they were making fantastic progress. And I'll let Frank talk about that. And it's an incredible testament to what the team has done to have delivered 10% growth both in the quarter and the year-to-date. But it was our belief that technologies such as Clover, right, with over $100 billion in annualized GPV growing at 40%, which is actually an increase from the prior year's growth rate. And then you think about Integrated Payments and ISV, and e-commerce growing 30% in transactions that, that these pockets were moving absolutely in the right direction. But don't forget, there's still a big partner solutions business. There's lots of other pieces of the business that continue to just move in the right direction. So, I think, we have a lot of room to continue to run and we'll be focused on that. The e-commerce business signed 30 new logos this year alone. ","So, we're taking the right steps and we're moving forward. And I think we believe that it will continue to grow. And also obviously, we have our international businesses that have been growing quite well. Frank, why don't you... ","Frank Bisignano ","I think the only other thing I would add is, these are technology-based businesses. Our acquisitions going back in time to us buying Clover, fully integrating Clover into the company, but letting it thrive as a Silicon Valley entity. Then the acquisitions in the ISV business, which is beginning to really show up, which were CardConnect and BluePay, and bringing that technology, integrating it in an integrated company and bringing technology on top of that to bring the best solutions that we thought technically were in the market. And then, e-com is a constant investment for us and you can count on us having continued investment in all three of these to continue a growth trajectory in those businesses. And international has been a star for us, but that was something that we started out with very little market share. And you see that as a strong double-digit grower for us. But the technical business, the partnership in this new company will just help this. I mean, if you want to ask about North America, you hear us talking about the privileged position that Fiserv had with its great core clients. And the reason why we've been able to go in, and I think you got to absorb that 20 wins in a 100-day period of time, that's from start of discussion to signing. And when you have $6 billion institutions and competitive takeaways, it's about the privileged position that Fiserv had with these clients. And I think Jeff and I have thought about good ways to bring it together, ways always that the clients are delighted with. ","David Koning ","And I'll just ask a very short follow-up. I know free cash flow and buybacks are so important to you guys. What do you think the Q4 share count is going to be just because it's confusing right now with partial quarter in Q3? ","Bob Hau ","Yes, David, it's Bob. We bought -- we started buying back in late September. We talked about we'll have some modest buyback under that 10b5 program. The way to think about it is, if you look in our press release, there's a couple of tables in there. We're about 695 million shares overall, is the way to think about it. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. ","Lisa Ellis ","Can you talk a little bit about is now you've got all of you guys together converged entity about international, a place where legacy First Data has had a lot of success. Not -- and historically a focus area for Fiserv. But as you're looking into sort of the investment priorities of the combined entity, what's the role of your international expansion? What are the priority geographies? How should we be thinking about that? Thank you. ","Jeff Yabuki ","Thanks, Lisa. I think, first of all, you -- I know that you've watched the international growth of First Data, and it was very, very targeted. And countries that we believe had a good payment economies had lots of runway in cash to cashless, and our ability to bring our skill set and tools there, and partner with great banks also. When we looked at the company, we found that the ability to take both institutions, put them together, run a very, very integrated business in each country and in each region, and then begin talking to our clients, that is one of the favorite things we like to do, visit clients, talk to them, talk to them about the solutions. So as we said before, I think there's great opportunity for us to bring merchants and issuing product into old Fiserv clients. And we think there's great opportunity to take many of the good products we have everywhere from dovetail to the way we could have hosted solutions for institutions which we have great relationships with. And I would say international, if you went to where we originally started, it's a much brighter spot and opportunity in totality, and our regional heads have been often running and doing a great job in integrating this company. ","Bob Hau ","Lisa, I would only add, when Frank and I and the teams were going through the combination analysis and looking for where were the big opportunities, we to some extent put international off to the side, because we had in the original Fiserv such a small international presence. And even though we had a fair amount of country diversity and maybe a larger amount of product diversity, we didn't necessarily think we would have the scale. And one of the things that we've been pleasantly surprised by is because of the infrastructure, the scale that First Data brought to the party, we're able to take our solutions, host them for clients and run them and create recurring revenue. And there's been a lot of energy. If you're in a local jurisdiction, you want product, and we had a lot of products. There are a lot of relationships. And so, we've got a lot more energy going back and forth. And we will now -- because of the combined company, we have reasonable scale. We will certainly look to deploy capital outside the U.S. where it makes sense strategically and for the rest of the benefit of the company. ","Lisa Ellis ","Thank you. And then, maybe my follow-up slightly related on e-com, 30% transaction growth, obviously a fantastic number. Can you give a sense for where in that extremely hot and hotly contested market you're winning? Is that -- should we be thinking this is a multinational omni-channel? Is this platforms where you're the back-end processor behind some of the big platform players? Is this small business USA? Give us a sense for sort of where you're seeing those wins? Thank you. ","Frank Bisignano ","Well, there's been a -- Jeff talked about the number of new logos, and that implication is large and accurate, which are the large institutions. You should think of them as large players who are brands that you aspire to have this business with. So we've been very, very fortunate to have notched a bunch of wins of large institutions who are heavy e-com players. And I think of it in that manner. I think also you can see us having a larger tax rate in our ISV business and other avenues where we're attaching more e-com to our small business and medium-sized ISVs. And yeah, we do have a somewhat privileged position as being a processor for some large players also, but I think when you look at the totality of what Jeff talked about in the winning space, it's been more at the front of the shop not at the back of the shop. ","Jeff Yabuki ","Yes, it's really been quite impressive. The list of names that the company has been able to bring into this table over the last couple of years, including a number of important names this year, as Frank said to some extent, aspirational names in industries that we are aware of. But there's also a fair amount of middle market, most of what we're seeing right now is in the OmniPay space, but in that middle market. So we're making great progress there. And we're building out a model where we're delivering incremental services so that we're able to create more value on a per transaction basis. So, it's early. We've had this conversation, but the momentum is, I think, far greater than certainly we understood, but as important I think more than the outside world is understood. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead. ","Darrin Peller ","Hey, guys. I just want to touch on -- look, if we hone in a bit more on the First Data growth, given the source of strength and upside versus prior rates. I mean again, you mentioned the strength in GBS continuing to trend well. If we could just break that down a little further on perhaps even in the US of the Partner Solutions business, the direct business, JVs, it seems like the partner solutions continues to really hold in their strong. And then, maybe just to add on to that, if you've seen any cross-sells on maybe -- has the Clover cross-sell into the digital banking side or just through your bank channels started yet, how has that been going? ","Jeff Yabuki ","So let me start and Frank will again add in -- will play off of each other on that. To answer your latter question first, we've seen exactly no revenue to-date from the bank channel. Lots of energy, as Frank talked about, 20 wins in 100 days and a large pipeline and lots of interest, which is particularly important now in a time where fee revenue is increasingly important and we're obviously looking to help our clients. So lots there. We are making real progress in deeply integrating the Clover technology into the digital solutions in which we control with our development shop. And so we don't have to deal with some of the exogenous factors that can get in the way of digital performance. So, from that perspective, that's all good. But again, to reiterate that's not in the numbers at this stage. It's really across the Board in merchant. Obviously, the things that we like to talk about are the digital commerce technologies and the things that are \"a little sexier\" than maybe some of the others. But partner solutions continues to be incredibly important, whether it is our business consultants who are out signing up merchants every day or signing a new ISV provider or a new e-commerce solution, it all comes together. And I think Bob in his prepared remarks talked about the fact that, that merchant locations overall are up double-digit year-over-year. And I think that really just talks to all things of what we're doing and how we're focused on driving the business in kind of one important vertical at a time. ","Darrin Peller ","And just one quick follow-up is on the bill pay cross-sell opportunity. Our checks are suggesting there's a pretty amount of white space in some of your enterprise clients at First Data still. Have you seen further evidence around that? ","Jeff Yabuki ","You heard Frank talk about the number of meetings that we've had with clients and talking about the power of the influential relationships. I mean, I think at this stage, the best way to frame it is, we're having a number of conversations that I don't think either of the original businesses will be having without having done this combination. So, we're bullish about that, but we also don't want the card ahead of the horse. We need to keep moving the processes along. But again, the conversations and the interest levels are quite high. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. ","Ben Budish ","This is Ben Budish on for Ramsey. I wanted to ask a follow-up on an earlier question on the share repurchases. So it's nice to have the confidence to kind of start doing that immediately. Just wondering what kind of pace should we expect while you're paying down debt should be kind of more of the historical norm of quarterly repurchases or maybe I'm more muted into the debt to further pay down? And kind of as a follow-up to that, given that kind of confidence in your cash flow generation, should we maybe expect to see incremental M&A perhaps earlier than expected? ","Jeff Yabuki ","Yes. So, I would say, one of the things that was in our prepared remarks is to make sure that we pointed out that we're buying under a 10b5 plan. And so -- which means that we would expect to be regularly in the market. I would say that we will not be in the market at the pace that we were at before. We are absolutely committed to making sure that we meet our leverage commitments to the agencies and we will for sure do that. And that will come from a combination of cash flow generation, debt repayment and growing EBITDA. So, from that perspective, I think we will pace it well, but cash flow is strong and we feel good about that. We also had a couple of smaller divestitures in the quarter. And so, we'll be looking to create as much opportunity as we can to deploy capital as we have historically. ","I would say that M&A itself is not a particularly high priority, differentiating and winning in the market is. And so, where there are opportunities for us to deploy capital for M&A and it's meeting our normal disciplined capital allocation deployment, then we're fine. But again, I think our number one priority is making sure that we meet our commitments from a leverage perspective. And then we take it from there. ","Operator","Thank you. David Togut from Evercore ISI. You may go ahead, sir. ","David Togut ","Thank you and congratulations on the new Fiserv. ","Jeff Yabuki ","Thanks, David. ","David Togut ","You called out 46% integrated sales growth in the quarter, Jeff, which I believe is the highest integrated sales growth we've seen at least for Fiserv standalone. Are there any major drivers to call out behind that? Is this a pickup in bank IT band, specific solutions gaining more traction? ","Jeff Yabuki ","Yes, it really has to do more with the level of investment that we have been making in our solution sets over the last few years and building product and having that product come to market. And that product has been a combination of internal builds as well as some small M&A that we've done that is enhancing our overall value proposition, specifically in some of the not surprisingly in the digital arenas. So, from that standpoint, it is really just about products that we've built. And I don't know that I would count it to be around growth in bank IT spend, but I do think it is the -- it talks to the importance of making sure you're building solutions in the places that matter most for clients. It's also around areas like deposit transformation, risk, fraud, the normal areas, mobile, digital as we talked about. And then, we believe wholeheartedly that the merchant solutions that we're going to bring the integrated solutions that Frank talked about through Clover and others will even further enhance that. ","David Togut ","Understood. And then as a follow-up, the preliminary 2020 outlook, can you give us any broad outlines in terms of what you're thinking about for First Data organic versus payments and financial, and then how you're thinking about the cadence of revenue and cost synergies flowing in 2020? ","Jeff Yabuki ","Sure. I would say that at this stage a couple of things. Number one, this is not meant to be guidance. And the more detail that we give, the more Bob will not be happy with me. So I think we're going to keep it at a pretty high level. The second thing I would say is, remember that we intend to re-segment the company. And so, when we give guidance, we'll be giving it across a new segmentation model. And so, I think again getting ahead of that wouldn't make sense. ","At the higher level, I can tell you that we feel quite comfortable that the kind of growth that is being delivered in the company is sustainable. And so, there's always going to have ranges around that sustainability. But generally, if you think about the former GBS segment of First Data, 10% growth in the quarter, 10% growth for the first three quarters. To us, that feels like a level of sustainability around that. And we think that each of our segments will continue to grow. You'll remember that it was important for us to look for, how could we continually and sustainably step-up internal revenue growth, and so we'll look to do that. And then, the last piece is around the synergies, right? And synergies, understand that -- as you know, synergies have to get sold and implemented. There are some things that come on faster than others. That's -- what I would say is, we would expect that to be more back-end loaded as some of the revenues come on. But again, we'll have to see how that all looks when we give guidance in February. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. ","Brett Huff ","Thank you for the preliminary goalposts around the '20 outlook. One thing that I'd like to know is, give us a sense of where there you could maybe do better than that, where there are kind of the tougher parts that you have to kind of perform better on it. Can you give us any -- just for instance is on the kind of upside downside drivers? ","Jeff Yabuki ","Sure. Again, Brett, remembering that we're not giving guidance, we'll give you -- we'll kind of try to give it to you at not the goalpost level, but maybe at the stadium level. So, we had talked about the fact that we expected revenue growth to be at least 7%. And there's a reasonable amount of variability as you start to move across the 50-odd line of the 7%. And that is, how does synergies come on, how quickly do they come on, how do sales go, how do implementations go. Probably the most important thing for us to lay out is, as we sit here today, a lot of things have to go right as always, but everything doesn't have to go right. And that we really thought a lot about what was going to be the right way for us to give this early visibility to '20. And so, we feel like this is a good solid number and that there'll be ways to outperform it. And as Bob will remind me later, there will be ways for us to underperform it. But we do feel on balance that we are in a pretty good place in terms of that -- in terms of the 7%. ","Brett Huff ","And then the follow-up is just more drilling down a little bit into the First Data segment. You told us about the GBS, which is really helpful. Any thoughts on the growth differential just qualitatively between the kind of the big JVs versus the more broad referral arrangements and kind of the longer tail of the bank channel. Can you give us any sense there on growth and maybe even profitability performance? ","Frank Bisignano ","Yes. It's Frank. I think you got to think about what we're doing today as continued investment and still getting better growth, right? And the JVs are always a good discussion to have. But I think you got to move to a bigger discussion, which is ISV growth, how long is that runway which is huge. This investment we made in Clover and the hundreds of people that we had developed it out that has us delivering as you heard caught in the $100 billion GPD mark and growing at 40%. So, I think it's all the elements of it, and then what you heard us talking about in e-com. So, a little bit, I'd move away from the dialogue about a JV or a bank channel and move more. And yes, we love the bank channel. You hear us talk about 20 wins in 100 days through the privileged position that Fiserv had. But I would not try to understand each one of those. I would understand the macro trends of ISV, e-com, Clover and digital distribution. ","Jeff Yabuki ","Yes. And I think Brett the thing that's important here is, remember, as we move to more of a GAAP methodology for recognizing the revenue, we were able to unshroud some of the underlying performance in certainly in GBS in the subsegment, formerly known as GBS North America. We were able to unshroud that. Now there are contributions that come in. And I would say that we have had growth contributions from the JVs that are better than they were last year. I would also guess that, that is the smallest of the contributors. And to Frank's point, the other pieces of the business are growing faster and will be faster growth vehicles not because as Frank said the banks -- the bank channel and the JVs are not important, they're critically important and we're going to do everything we can to grow them. But we think that the seeds that have been planted in First Data for the last three or four years, whether it be Clover or BluePay or CardConnect or a lot of original or internal development, that it takes time for those products to be built and come to market. And so that's -- those are really the bigger drivers, just to reiterate Frank's commentary. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. You may go ahead, sir. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar ","Hi, Jeff, Frank, Bob, congratulations on the good start to the combined journey here. ","Jeff Yabuki ","Thank you, Ashwin. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar ","Yes. So, the question I have is the velocity at which you went from start to finish was remarkable for the bank wins you mentioned. Would be great to kind of get a little bit more granular on the -- on what's feeding that pace and urgency? And is it kind of limited to this subset of clients or prospects you're speaking with? Or can we make any broader suppositions about bank IT spending from there? ","Jeff Yabuki ","Yes, let me start, Ashwin, on that. It's a couple of things. I mean, when Frank and I got together and we talked about this, one of the many points of serendipity was Frank had believed that having an access to be able to get deep integration to a core processing system was really important. And then, we are the largest core processor in the U.S. and really in the world. And so that -- the ability to drive integration, different levels of integration and access to information will allow banks to create a more compelling integrated merchant experience for their customers, and also because these are revenue-sharing partnerships be able to create fee revenue. And you know Ashwin that fee revenue right now is really important. And so you've got a convergence where we love the fact that we not only are -- we have these great relationships with clients, but we get to pay them. And that -- we think that actually works quite well. And it speaks to the 20 wins in a 100 days. I just think it speaks to the fact that as we had talked about historically, especially at the smaller end of the ranges that Frank was talking about, you have banks that really haven't paid a lot of attention to it and they see this as a great opportunity to go out and serve their customers and to create some additional fee revenue. And Frank, I think I would say it's going a little bit better than I anticipated. ","Frank Bisignano ","Yes, I mean, off to a great start. Off to a great start. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar ","Great. And then a clarification I have is what portion of the 2019 outlook raise is due to synergies 4Q -- at least within Q4 forces the components themselves they seem to be doing better at this point? ","Jeff Yabuki ","Yes. I mean, the synergies, Ashwin, the synergies are very low for this quarter. There will be something less than very low in the next quarter. But as you know, we talked about the fact that we have actioned annualized run rate synergies of a couple of hundred million dollars. But the substantial majority of that is going to pop in next year. I would say that synergy the idea of synergies in our numbers for 2019 have not had any meaningful impact on how we have set our guidance. They're an important part of next year. And I would say that probably the biggest single driver of what some people consider synergies would be interest expense saves in our numbers vis-\u00e0-vis the prior original companies. ","Operator","Thank you. Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. ","Glenn Greene ","I guess, the first question, it sounds like -- maybe I'm reading into this but it sounds like you're increasingly confident in the $500 million revenue synergy number. You've talked a bit about it but maybe the areas where specifically you see the upside opportunity relative to what you thought or incremental opportunities that you had are really fully appreciated early on that gives you more confidence in that $500 million? ","Jeff Yabuki ","Yes. I mean this privileged position that we have with the banks, until you go visit them and actually can talk to them, you're not really sure how it's all going to turn out. Now, we knew that we both had deep love of financial institutions and they were our lifeblood. But whether it would turn out this way wasn't all that clear. So, we feel good about how that's going to come out and over the long haul, be worth to heck a lot of money. I'd say, secondly, you heard us talk about international. That's probably something that most people and it's all only put the two together that we would be so bullish on. And I don't think we initially had it in our base case, so to speak, when we thought about it. Maybe we thought we'd save some money. But I think the revenue opportunity there is pretty large. And then, when you move to the spaces like our credit business and putting these two together, it becomes very clear. I'd like to say the biggest proof point for us has been the client's office, right? There's no better thing than Jeff and I have had the benefit of doing multiple client meetings together, and then obviously we do things separately. But it's so clear the power of the franchise and we always come out with more opportunities and more thought. Network will obviously, like credit will be big for us. Output is a tremendous opportunity. So, 100 days in, we feel better than we did when we saw it on the journey. ","Glenn Greene ","Yes. ","Jeff Yabuki ","And Glenn, we are -- I mean, I think you heard we have good confidence in the $500 million. And we also think it's prudent for us to wait until our Investor Day to really layout in detail how we see it coming together and where we may see opportunities to do a little bit better. ","Glenn Greene ","Okay. And then, just a follow-up question will be the bread selling environment. I mean I heard the 15% bookings growth in the quarter, but just some context on what you're seeing at a high level across the businesses. Your peers are obviously seeing really good results too. So it's kind of curious, a lot of concern about the macro economy, but a lot of companies in the sector are not seeing it. So I'm just curious what you're seeing? ","Jeff Yabuki ","Sure. So, I would say that you if you think about -- you have to think about at least for us -- for us original Fiserv people. We've had to open the aperture and we're happy to do it. We're not just serving primarily financial institutions anymore. We're serving really everyone who does something in the world of payments, commerce, money movement and fintech. And so, from that standpoint, when you think about the entire ecosystem, there's a lot going on. And what's happening in financial institutions is -- financial institutions are biasing their spend to areas in which it's most -- where it is most visible to their customers. So whether it's digital -- sorry, whether it's consumer or commercial by things that are digital, abilities to serve clients in an Amazon-like way that's really where you're seeing money go. And then, just money movement payments that entire space is just fraught with energy and innovation and everyone is looking to make sure that they're on the way. And because of the breadth of the company and the investments that we collectively have been making over the last few years, I think, we're fairly well-positioned. What we have to make sure that we continue to do is that we meet our commitments and deliver for our clients because that's really what they need most right now. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from North Coast Research. You may go ahead. ","Kartik Mehta ","Jeff, I think, I know the answer to this based on all your commentary for 2019 guidance and your outlook in 2020, but just wanted to get your thoughts. As you have conversations with banks and interest rates are moving all over the place and they're getting pressure on their net interest margin. I'm assuming that's not having an impact on their spend at least as far as you can see and that's the reason for your confidence in 2020. Is that kind of fair? ","Jeff Yabuki ","I would say -- I would say, it's probably too bold to say it's not having any impact on their spend, it is. But what we're seeing and we've seen this before is institutions are making choices. Perhaps their discretionary spend is going down or they're spending less on older systems and more on newer systems again where the institution meets the customer in the places that matter most. So, I do see that going on. And the conversations are how do we do more, and in times like this where you are a full-scale provider, you have opportunities to go in and win more business. And so, we're certainly hoping and building strategy around the fact that we think the suite that we bring on balance is the best in the market. And so, we're looking to Frank's point about how we have client conversations and there's more interest in doing things. There's a lot of opportunity to see, can you do things more efficiently and effectively as one larger enterprise. And so, that was one of the things, Kartik, that we liked about this transaction is, yeah, on one hand, there are some that say it's best to be pure play. We think being broad and the ability to put things together and integrate in new and innovative ways gives us a bit of a market advantage. ","Kartik Mehta ","And just one last question for you, Frank. As you look at Clover customers today versus a year ago, is there been a change in the type of customers that are using Clover? And as you see Clover evolve over the next, let's just -- for the sake of our conversation, take about 12 to 18 months, is that changed at all? ","Frank Bisignano ","I think the breadth of Clover continues to see it larger. I think if you go back in time, we talked about dining solutions and delivering to restaurants. So, our breadth that what our development teams are doing is continuing to build functionality that gives us more vertical depth. We've gone outside the U.S. You see us in Canada. You see us in Europe. You should expect the releases in Latin America. We've been tremendously advantaged as we were strategic in Argentina and how to capitalize on that change, and Clover was part of that strategy. I would also say as we continue to build out functionality with the combination of our ISV solution in Clover, the ability to bring the two together for a best-in-class solution for merchants who use integrated software is what you'll see happen. So, the answer -- the short answer is yes, and the rest was the description of how and where. ","Jeff Yabuki","Thanks, Kartik. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We really appreciate your support. If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great evening. ","Operator","Thank you.

Yabuki","Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. We closed out an excellent 2013 with solid fourth quarter results. We integrated Open Solutions, delivered new innovation to the market, grew sales and achieved our full year financial goals, including our 28th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Adjusted revenue increased 10%, both in the quarter and for the year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter and 3% for the full year. Adjusted earnings per share increased 14% for the quarter and 18% for the year. Adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points for the year due to high-quality growth in our recurring revenue businesses, the benefits of synergies and operational efficiencies.","Our strong financial performance translated into free cash flow of nearly $900 million for the year and a stellar 20% increase in free cash flow per share, both measures exceeding our expectations for the year.","Sales also finished strong, attaining 138% of quota in the quarter, before the strong performance of Open Solutions. Our market momentum gives us confidence in an accelerating internal revenue growth rate as the new revenue comes online.","Early in '13, we provided 3 enterprise priorities to help you gauge our overall progress, and we're pleased with our results this year. The first priority was to continue to build high quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to extend market momentum into deeper client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. And last, to deliver innovation and integration that enhances results for our clients, with an important focus on Open Solutions.","As I mentioned upfront, we met or exceeded each of our 2013 financial commitments. Our adjusted internal revenue growth rate increased to 3% from 2% in 2012. And our focus on high-quality revenue and operational efficiency allows us to drive strong earnings growth while investing for the future.","We also know that cash flow conversion matters, which is reflected in our 16% growth in free cash flow and 20% increase in free cash flow per share.","We had strong consumer transaction growth in areas such as debit, person-to-person payments and mobile. We also saw growth return in our electronic bill payment business with transactions finishing the year up 7%, primarily from new client implementations.","Our second priority was deepening client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. At our recent Investor Day, we discussed a variety of topics, including our account processing momentum in the mid to large bank and large credit union market segments. Since we met on December 10, we closed 4 more sizable wins in these important market segments, further validating our strong value proposition for these institutions. We also added more than 400 Mobiliti clients and nearly 1 million new Mobiliti ASP subscribers this year, more than doubling the number of users. Since launching our tablet ASP solution last April, we've signed more than 200 institutions and got over 100 of these clients live in the fourth quarter.","We remain focused on enabling our clients with the best-in-class digital solution as they transform the financial experience for their customers. Speaking of which, our third priority was to deliver innovation and integration with an important focus on Open Solutions. Innovation is a critical market differentiator as we partner with our clients. As one of several proof points, we filed for 22 new patents in 2013 to further drive client success.","During 2013, we also received a number of third-party recognitions for our mobile technologies and are generally recognized as having the leading solutions in the market.","In 2014, we'll go live with a new user experience for our Online Banking solution, which reflects today's consumer preferences, including a seamless design across all digital devices.","We launched Snap to Pay, which allows a consumer to take a picture of their bill and easily setup a new biller in our bill payment solution. This product leverages camera functionality and encourages increased usage. Real-time movement of non-point of sale payment transactions is a unique opportunity, where financial institutions can deliver both value to their customers and grow their revenue.","From 0, we signed over 150 institutions for Popmoney Instant Payments during the year. We believe that real-time will become the norm. And we expect to lead the charge in the new way money moves in this large untapped arena.","Speaking of moving money now, same-day expedited bill payments were up more than 140% year-over-year. And we expect this growth to accelerate as we expand availability across the 1.5 billion bill payments we process each year.","One of our highlights is the integration of Open Solutions. The market's receptivity to our acquisition has been beyond positive, which is manifesting in less client attrition, a larger add-on sales opportunity than we anticipated, and meaningful sales momentum in DNA and other acquired solutions, such as Weiland Account Analysis and CUnify for account processing.","As I shared at Investor Day, we increased our original revenue and cost synergy targets to exceed $100 million and $60 million, respectively. We beat our original 2013 synergy objectives and are well positioned going into '14.","We closed another 10 DNA sales in the quarter, bringing the total to 31 new sales as compared to only 10 in 2012. Our new sales tended to be larger, multiproduct license and outsource implementations, which will primarily go live in the second half of 2014 and 2015, which means a substantial portion of this revenue is deferred into the future.","Earlier today, we announced that Washington Federal, one of the country's 100 largest banks with 235 locations and assets over $14 billion, became the largest bank to ever select DNA. They were looking for an in-house, real-time account processing solution to anchor their technology vision. DNA, integrated with market-leading capabilities such as Corillian, Mobiliti and a variety of Fiserv's payment solutions, will provide this rapidly growing institution the foundation for a differentiated customer experience.","On that note, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional details on our results.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter and full year increased 10% to $1.2 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. Adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated to 4% in the fourth quarter. That was within the expectations we shared with you in the third quarter. Internal growth in both the Financial and Payments segments was led by strength in our high quality recurring revenue businesses.","Full year adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% was also in line with our expectations. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.79, up 14% over the prior year's quarter. And for the full year, increased 18% to $2.99. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter of 30.5% was down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Margin performance was negatively impacted in 2 primary areas.","As we previewed in the third quarter, corporate expenses were up in the fourth quarter. And given our strong finish, we also had higher variable compensation expense from both commissions and incentive compensation. Overall, the Corporate segment had a 100-basis-point negative impact on operating margin in the quarter.","For the full year, overall margin increased 30 basis points to 30%, in line with our guidance. Overall margin expansion was driven by high quality revenue growth, excellent Operational Effectiveness results and Open synergies, offset by a couple of larger headwinds coming into the year.","At the segment level, adjusted internal revenue in Payments grew 6% in the quarter to $596 million. Growth in the segment for the full year was 5%, accelerating from 2% in 2012. Segment revenue growth was led by strong performance across a number of businesses in the segment.","Although we did see some continuation of the transactions following the industry experience at the end of the third quarter, we still recorded solid transaction growth. Debit transactions grew 13%, and we recorded 9% transaction growth in our bill payment business for the quarter. We added to our Payments momentum with these mission-critical solutions, signing 44 debit clients and 96 new bill payment clients in the quarter. And for the full year, added 145 and 335 new clients, respectively.","Payments segment adjusted operating income was up 5% in the quarter to $184 million. And for the year, increased 7% to $702 million. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 30.9% is up slightly sequentially and down 50 basis points compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily due to the mix of revenue, including lower license revenue and the higher variable compensation, as I mentioned earlier.","For the full year, segment operating margin was up 50 basis points to 31%, driven by growth in our scale businesses and operational efficiencies, partially offset by the revenue impact of the Bank of America bill payment renewal.","Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 15% to $600 million and 14% to $2.3 billion for the quarter and full year, respectively, primarily due to the acquisition of Open. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 2% in the quarter and flat for the full year. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our account processing and lending businesses. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 20% in the quarter to $208 million, and up 17% for the year to $761 million.","Adjusted operating margin was strong in the quarter, increasing by 140 basis points to 34.5%, and by 60 basis points to 32.6% for the full year when compared to the prior year period.","Scale efficiencies and Operational Effectiveness savings, including Open synergies, were the primary drivers for increases in adjusted operating margin.","The adjusted operating loss in the Corporate segment for the quarter was $30 million, up sequentially and versus the prior year, as I discussed earlier. This was primarily due to higher variable compensation associated with the strong close to the year, unusually lower prior year expenses and increased expenses associated with the implementation of a new HR system.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.8%, and for the full year was 34.8%, in line with our expectations.","For 2014, we expect our tax rate to be slightly above 35%. We anticipate a number of discrete tax benefits, primarily in the second quarter, which should largely offset the combined negative impact of the R&D tax credit not yet renewed and certain nonrecurring discrete tax benefits recorded in 2013.","We recorded a gain in our GAAP results related to a partial divestiture of a business within our StoneRiver joint venture. This after-tax gain of $54 million has been excluded from our adjusted earnings per share results. Given this divestiture and other activity within StoneRiver, we anticipate our after-tax adjusted equity earnings to be down about $5 million or $0.02 per share in 2014.","Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter and at a record level of more than $1 billion for the year. Free cash flow per share was exceptional, increasing 20% to $3.33 as a result of earnings growth, improvements in working capital and continued capital discipline.","Total debt at year end was $3.8 billion or 2.4x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, which is within our target leverage ratio.","Adjusted for our December stock split, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of stock in the quarter for $124 million. And for the year, returned $587 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 12.6 million shares at an average cost of approximately $47 per share.","There were 18.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase and 256.7 million shares outstanding at the end of the year.","With that, I will turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Tom. As I mentioned upfront, sales, excluding Open Solutions, were strong, attaining 138% of quota in the quarter and 108% of quota for the full year. Excellent results in account processing and digital channels led our performance in the quarter. Actual total contract value for the year increased 6%, excluding Open, which is excellent performance, given the record number of larger bill payment sales in the prior year.","The TCV of our larger sales transactions has continued to grow, which is an important marker of future growth. The aggregate value of our top 10 deals for 2013 was 20% higher than the prior year and more than 50% greater than the value in 2011. While the revenue from these transactions tend to come on slowly due primarily to size and complexity, this tends to be high quality recurring revenue that should provide an uplift to internal revenue growth over the next several years.","Integrated sales were $244 million for the year, up 29% over the prior year, beating our $210 million target easily. Sales were strong across a broad range of market-leading solutions, including bill payment, debit, statements, Mobiliti and source capture. We exceeded our Operational Effectiveness goal of $60 million, which includes the Open Solutions cost synergy target, by 35%. We achieved $81 million of savings for the year on the strength of greater-than-expected Open cost synergy attainment and solid execution of our Operational Effectiveness objectives. Exiting year 3 of this 5-year program, we've generated $188 million of annual savings, which puts us 50% ahead of our scheduled target.","The market environment has showed continuing stability. There were only 5 regulatory actions in the quarter and 40 for the full year, which is down 38% over 2012. We expect only a handful of regulatory actions this year.","Targeted M&A continues to be active, and we expect that trend to continue as institutions look for better ways to leverage their business models. Our view of the landscape remains the same as we highlighted at Investor Day, with financial institutions focusing their technology spend on solutions that generate revenue, deal with an uncertain and complex regulatory environment or focus on operational efficiency.","Our key priorities for 2014 are generally in line with our 2013 priorities. First, to continue to build high quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings commitments. Second, extend market momentum deeper into client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients.","Now let me provide context for our 2014 guidance. As you know, our focus is to sustainably accelerate our revenue growth rate through the addition of high-quality revenue, which we define as revenue that is recurring, has high cash flow conversion and is generally accretive to our company operating margin. We are executing our plans and are pleased that our 2014 internal revenue growth expectation is within our long-term outlook.","In 2013, we increased our internal revenue growth rate to 3% from the 2% in 2012. As you saw in our release, we expect to achieve 4% to 4.5% internal revenue growth in '14, which, again, steps up our internal revenue growth rate at least 1%.","As we mentioned at Investor Day, we do have some notable headwinds impacting us this year, albeit at a reduced rate compared to 2013. In our biller businesses, we have some large client attrition, primarily associated with acquisitions of our clients. We also have a couple of large online banking implementations in our international operations that are going live, that will have a negative impact on year-over-year growth.","We estimate that the more significant revenue headwinds this year are about 1\/2 of what we dealt with last year, which provides a benefit to 2014 and should further abate next year. While we are clearly not giving 2015 guidance today, we expect to exit '14, given current signings, backlog and pipeline, pointed towards another incremental step up in internal revenue growth.","Now let's move on to our actual outlook for '14. We expect adjusted revenue growth of 4% to 5%. And as I just mentioned, we expect adjusted internal revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. We expect adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 13% or in a range of $3.28 to $3.37. We anticipate growth in revenue and operating earnings to be stronger in the second half of '14, primarily due to the mix of sales and the timing of client implementations.","We estimate free cash flow per share will be up at least 10% to $3.65 or greater, on top of our exceptional performance in 2013. We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will increase at least 50 basis points for the full year.","Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2014 is $60 million, which includes the impact of Open Solutions synergies. And last, our integrated sales target, which includes revenue synergies related to the Open Solutions acquisition, to be $250 million.","In closing, we're pleased with our 2013 performance. We acquired and integrated Open Solutions, moved our strategies forward, grew recurring revenue, delivered record earnings and free cash flow, and added to sales momentum. Each consistent with the targets we laid out early in the year. And as important, the success we had last year sets us up for additional revenue growth acceleration, along with strong financial performance in 2014.","However, none of this happens without the collective effort of our more than 21,000 associates who are committed to our clients and are truly the engine of your company.","With that, Angie, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Koning from Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess my first question just bill payment, you've done a tremendous job accelerating revenue growth there with the signings. And you've had a few quarters of high-single to low-double digit transaction growth. And I'm wondering, how much of that is from the new wins and how much is kind of underlying growth? And kind of what's the sustainable growth kind of over time in that business?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, it's a good question, Dave. I mean, we, clearly, with the size of the conversions that we had in '13, a lot of that growth came from migrating the new clients on the system. As they get on, we expect those newer institutions to move up to a more normal rate, as we would see within our base. And so we expect to have better-than-average growth from those larger institutions in '14 as compared to their peers who are more mature within our system. We have, as I mentioned, or as we've mentioned, we have some larger implementations coming on in '14, and we think that will definitely help. And we have some platform changes that we're making. There was a release that we put out in the last month or so around the gamification of our experience. And we expect that, that will actually have some pretty intriguing sustainable growth characteristics, although we won't see that really until 2015. I would say the only drag that we have, and we've had it for the majority of this year as well, is our largest client, which is, obviously, Bank of America. As we move through the repricing, Bank of America has just not grown at the level that we've seen across some of our other clients. And because of the size of that, it tends to drag on our rate a lot. But across the universe, we feel good about where we are. We feel quite good about the implementations we have going on in '14. And frankly, we ended up having a very strong fourth quarter. And those implementations will happen later in the year and then into '15 as well.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. Okay. And then I just -- just my second question. We got in touch with a bunch of banks lately, and just asked them what they thought about EMV requirements that might be coming up. And certainly, there's a lot of moving parts still on how it's all going to play out. But one thing that kept coming up is they would say, \"We'll just ask Fiserv what to do when the time comes.\" And so it seems like that could potentially be a good opportunity. But I'm wondering how to think about that. Is that something that you get paid for to kind of consult them and to send out all the new cards? How should we think about that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Sure. And Dave, I think as you know, we have a couple of different businesses in that space. We, obviously, have our debit business, our debit processing business, and we have some consulting services that are in there as well. And we're working with clients to help them optimize their revenue, reduce their fraud and deliver more profitability on a card-by-card basis. The second business that we have is our output solutions business, which is actually a plastics manufacturer. And so in that business, we, actually about 1 year, 1.5 years ago, made significant investments to prepare for EMV. So we are quite ready for EMV. And so as that occurs and as EMV moves through the system, which I believe the mandate is sometime in '15, which will take several years to actually get fully rolled out, but we do expect that -- we would expect that to have a positive impact on our reissuing of cards. It's hard to quantify exactly what that is, but I would certainly qualify that as a tailwind moving forward. I can tell you that as we sit here today, we've not assumed that the incidents that we're seeing in the market have any meaningful impact on the EMV timeframe. That said, I do expect that the outcomes of these kinds of issues will, in fact, have some impact. And I think as we move through the year, we'll be able to give you better insights into how that will impact our results.","Operator","Darrin Peller from Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to start off first with the guidance that you gave for both top line and first, I guess. When we look at the end of the year run rate and your Payments growth rate being as strong as it was at 6%, and even Financial, obviously, accelerating nice, had a fairly decent pickup. And we couple that with -- I know some of the headwinds that you had been talking about abating at the end of December, rolling off, it just seems like the 4% to 4.5%, does that account for -- how much headwinds, if you can get a little more granular with what actually rolled off from a headwinds standpoint and what's coming on from a headwinds standpoint? And then I guess on top of that, maybe you can expand further, it seems like the Payments mix, being more mobile banking, being more bill pay, more PIN debit, should drive really a better and better growth rate in that Payments segment through the year and through '15 as well, which one would think would drive a better accelerated growth rate on top of what you're seeing at the exit of this year. Is there any -- can you just try to -- maybe just poke holes in what we're seeing here and help us understand why there wouldn't be more acceleration?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, Darrin, it's Tom. And then I'll turn it over to Jeff. I think, as you know, our business model, as Jeff kind of highlighted in his comments, when we bring on this revenue, we're extremely focused on high quality recurring revenue. And it does take time to build up. We made, I think, great progress, where our guidance, as you know, internal revenue growth of 4% to 4.5% coming off a year of 3%. Just your question on the headwinds side, we indicated last year that we had a little bit -- around 1% headwind coming in on the combination of 2 events. And we have about 1\/2 of that coming into '14, as Jeff highlighted in his prepared comments, both in our biller business and in our international. So that's clearly helpful. If you wanted to articulate that, it's about 50 basis points of help in '14, but we're still growing on top of that, roughly kind of 1%, given our actual internal growth rate that we had in 2013. So that 1% is about $40 million. There's always puts and takes in every year that we have. But again, I think you'll see that momentum continue to build as we kind of go through the year. We have a lot of our new business, our new clients that are coming on from Open. Primarily, that is going to implement in the second half of 2014. And that should gives us nice momentum, again, to kind of build off that as we leave '14 and kind of come into 2015.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","And Darrin, I would say that if you take a look at the performance of the Payments segment or both segments, but really the Payments segment through the year, we, obviously, had a better second half of '13 than we did in the first half. And we would expect to see that same performance in '14. I think one of the things that is going on and one of the reasons why we are where we are in the guidance is, on top of the headwind issue, I mean, we are, obviously, dependent upon our clients to go live. And there are implementations that have moved a little bit. And in some of these cases, it doesn't take very many implementations to have some kind of an aggregate effect. So that's one of the issues. The other thing, frankly, is as we ended up the year, we mentioned we had quite a strong sales quarter. And we had actually a very strong sales year overall. But the mix of that business really biased much more to recurring revenue and more complex hosted implementations. And that has a real -- as we shared at Investor Day, it has a real impact on how we can, in fact, recognize that revenue. I think if you look at our balance sheet, you'll see that deferred revenue is growing. You can see how our cash flow looks. You just got a number of those factors that come into play. And the other piece of it, frankly, is as we sit here today on February 5, there are a number of puts and takes that we can see in the landscape. And we think that where we are right now is the best place for us to be. We feel good about the fact that we're in our long term -- within our long-term outlook. We feel good that we're going to continue to step our revenue up through this year. And as we mentioned, we're not giving guidance for '15, but we do feel good about where we see our exit rate. Just like we kind of had the 4% exit rate this year, right, on the heels of a better second half performance, we would expect to see a similar outcome, all things being equal, on February 5, 2014 as we exit this year. So we actually feel quite good about where we are from a revenue perspective. And we will see that build throughout the year.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Now that makes sense, I mean, especially as you see the increased percentage from some of the faster growth areas improve your mix. And you're right, the end of the year did certainly show up in that way.","I guess, just going one step further, and I'll turn it back to the queue. On the Financial side, we certainly are seeing momentum with RFPs. I mean, you're seeing a lot more deal signage. I'd love to hear your perspective, what exactly you think is going on in the market around the banks, and your customer base, that's really driving how much more demand today. Is it vendor consolidation, is it more just cost efficiencies that are pent-up? Can you give us a little more color on how it's become so much stronger, and if it's sustainable?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Darrin, when you talk about the RFPs, are you really talking about, on the core account processing side?","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, exactly. On the Financial side, it's definitely taken a new, sort of level of growth, and it seems to have a new life to it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean I would say, it's interesting that you say that, and Mark spent time talking about this at Investor Day, and I'll give a little bit of perspective and let Mark answer the question. I mean, I don't think we would say there's more -- necessarily more RFPs. I mean there are lesser banks in that space. There is some M&A activity, and often, when you see -- have M&A activity in that space, you end up having 2 banks come together and they decide to go to RFP. I think for us, we would say that, we had not had the success that we've had in that space. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that not only had we won, I think, 6 deals when we talked on December 10, at Investor Day, but we've actually -- in the large bank space, we actually won 3 additional since then. Was it 7? It was 7, sorry, Tom corrected me. So we -- it's really our value proposition that is resonating more, and frankly, I think that's what's starting to separate us, but Mark...","Mark A. Ernst","I got to say, I'm not sure that we would conclude that we're seeing more RFP activity. You may be kind of hearing about it in a way that you haven't historically, but the strict RFP activity looks pretty similar to what we've seen historically. It's a little bit different between banks and credit unions. On the bank side, as Jeff mentioned, when you -- we are seeing more activity when 2 banks are coming together, and we are seeing some of that. And the consequences, as many of these banks are looking for their own business plans and how they expect to grow into the future, they are, in fact, looking at their core platform and whether or not that platform can take them into the future. And I think something like WashFed that we announced this morning, is a great example of that, as they are rapidly growing. They knew they needed a different technology platform from which to enable that growth. So we are seeing that, but it's probably not more activity. It just may be more prominent activity. On the credit union side, that one I'd say is a little bit different. When we think about the credit union, I think this past year there was a lot of activity, induced in many ways by us and in our combination with Open Solutions. We don't think that is going to sustain at the kind of rapid clip that you saw last year, in terms of the amount of -- kind of activity that's noisy in the market. But that remains to be seen. Clearly, there is a bias toward kind of leading technology in the credit union core account processing world, and we think we are really well positioned with that, because of the DNA and the kind of multitude of platforms that we have that position us well to be able to meet a variety of different credit union needs. So spending -- more color than you were looking for, but I think we are pretty close to this market and feel good about where we're positioned.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Hey Darrin, I would say just -- I would make 2 other points that I think are important. One's a little bit more of a global point, and that is -- we talked about Investor Day is -- this maybe overly generous, but there's almost a democratization of the technology availability, in that these mid to large banks, who are historically have competed with these larger banks, it's been very difficult for them. Now we are making -- generally making those kinds of technologies available. And so our value proposition as these banks focus on areas like channels and payments and other kinds of things, they want that value proposition that looks a lot like the very large banks. And because of our market-leading, kind of best-in-class technologies integrated into these cores, it's a much more valuable proposition. And then the other point that's really important is the Washington Federal deal that we announced today, we could not have responded to that RFP had we not owned Open Solutions, because we actually did not have a real-time, in-house solution. And so we would have been excluded from that, and that transaction ended up being very attractive for DNA. But multiples larger because of all of the other add-on solutions that we added to that. Those kinds of things will end up not just seeding the Financial segment, but actually the majority of the revenue in that transaction will actually show up in the Payments segment over time.","Mark A. Ernst","The other thing that I'm going to add to Jeff's comment, in that large bank segment, call it bigger than $3 billion banks, maybe up to $30 billion, this past year, we won -- we landed new clients with 4 different platforms. That is the importance of having a variety of different technologies that meet different needs of different institutions, different strategies, so...","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's part of the genesis of the question I had is from your Investor Day, hearing about all the larger, $3 billion -- $3 billion to $30 billion sized banks being an opportunity for you guys. But that's been -- it's all been very helpful color, guys.","Operator","Brett Huff from Stephens Incorporated.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I just have one question, and sort of bigger picture. You guys have amassed a really good set -- suite of services, and I think your other competitors are moving along in that way as well. What is the -- can you kind of outline your strategy as it differs from others? It seems like you guys have a lot of success with the cross sale, bill pay, card processing, et cetera. I mean, are you -- is it a proprietary system that you're implementing? Is it an open system? Kind of what is the strategy that allows you to win those deals? Are you bundling, are you pricing more aggressively? I just think your string of cross sales continue to be really impressive. And so what's the strategy that's winning there for you?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I wish, Brett, I wish it were as simple as a one-size-fits-all answer. I mean, I would say that early on, if you think all the way back to 2006 when we introduced this, we were probably selling a little bit ahead of our value proposition. We were talking about integration, we were talking about what are those services that we can bring that will allow us to help our clients best serve their customers. And over the last several years, we have buttressed our integration. We have real integration advantages in our payments platforms. We have real integration advantages in our channels platforms. We've looked for places where data allows us to provide new value, and it's very early, and it's not meant to be a big data comment, but data ultimately will be very important in how this all works together. We've clearly bundled in many cases. We know that at times, we need to work with our clients to allow them to have access to more of our technologies, and we're willing to do that in a way -- we care a lot less, for better or worse, we care a lot less about the revenue that's created instantaneously. We care about the revenue that's created over time, and how do we think these clients will grow. And so we try to use more creative pricing strategies where we can and where it helps our clients step into our technology. And we've actually done a fair amount of that over the last year, and I'm really excited about some of the creativity that Tom and Mark and their teams have brought to bear on that. And then, the last piece is, our people really believe it's valuable. I mean we have -- we spend a lot of time talking about the advantages that we bring. We reinforce it. We hold people accountable to delivering this value that we know is there for clients. But at the same time, if there's a client who doesn't want our solution, we're open to integrating other people's solutions in here. It's not a proprietary -- we have many proprietary products, but it's not a closed loop. All right? We are open to allowing other solutions to come into our market. In fact, if we don't have the best solution, we would encourage other folks to -- we would encourage integration with other solutions. So that's clearly part of our value proposition. And then, the last thing I would say is, we've dramatically improved our reference ability because we've introduced a service model over the last couple of years that encompasses and brings together the fact that you can't have a single service manager anymore. You have to have someone who can manage a holistic relationship, and that was one of the challenges that we had early on, and we've seen significant improvement in that area, and much happier, much more engaged clients who are, frankly, happy to tell their friends.","Mark A. Ernst","And I'd just say, one other thing I would add to that is, and Jeff talked about the fact that we offer kind of a -- clients to pick and choose or do what they want to do. But one of the advantages that our clients regularly report to us is they see that we have the market-leading surround solutions, and because of that market-leading position that we have with a variety of these additional add-on services, it actually allows people to have confidence to take a full suite from Fiserv, rather than needing to go elsewhere, and that integration advantage that we build into our technologies that we add-on, really is very real, that brings sort of financial benefits back to our clients when they bring in Fiserv solutions.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Just one last question. Any update on the bill -- mobile banking and the peer-to-peer revenue\/business model, and I'll get back in the queue.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I'm not -- so -- I would say, if that's about real time -- Brett, are you still on?","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes. I just -- it's -- the mobile banking that you guys have had success with, is that going to be sort of like Internet banking, where it's a couple of bucks a user a month, or kind of where is the revenue model there, just on the Internet -- or mobile banking piece? Or is it really going to be the add-on services of bill pay that you've given away for free, to make money in the back end? And then the same question for peer-to-peer, I know you guys are talking about trialing different...","Jeffery W. Yabuki","As we sit here today, we have multiple ways for clients to acquire those technologies. You have a license and services model, you have a licensed services and hosted model, and then we have -- the more broad solution is an ASP subscriber-based model. And we added nearly 1 million users to that model this year. Our tablet solution works exactly the same way. We signed 200 clients in 2013, and we're -- and got -- went live with 100 of them late in the fourth quarter. And that's on a subscription basis is as well. So it's -- any of those models depend on the strategy of the institution. We see this to be economically viable in its own right, and then integrated with our additional solutions, I think one of the slides we had at Investor Day, are things like source capture, mobile capture, P2P and a variety of other kinds of solutions that are additive in the mobile wrapper.","Operator","Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess the first question, just want to get clarification on the Open sort of synergies that you're assuming into 2014. I think you sort of called out within the $60 million Operational Effectiveness and this $250 million integrated sales, has it included Open? Anyone can give us some color and give us some perspective on how much of the total Open synergy should be realized by the end of '14?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think most of those synergies were realized in '13, and we have another piece that's coming in, in 2014. So I would say again, the amount of synergy value from a cost synergy standpoint is less in 2014 than it was in 2013. That being said, we continue to have good momentum with that, and the cost synergies where we said greater than $60 million, that's going to be largely accomplished in 2 years, Glenn, to give you a little perspective of that. And then a little bit in year 3 also. We'll have some in there, in one particular area. So that's from a cost synergy standpoint. I don't know if you -- on the revenue synergy, clearly it's going to be the other way. It's going to take a number of years as we continue to build that from an integrated sales target standpoint, we've built in those revenue synergies. You saw our success in '13 and our increased target in '14. So that is going to continue to build over the next several years.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So the $250 million integrated sales doesn't assume a lot for Open in 2014, and then it sounds like you realized a fair amount of 2013 synergies already?","Thomas J. Hirsch","On the cost side.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Can you -- how much was that? Of the total $60 million was realized in '13?","Thomas J. Hirsch","I would say, it's probably 1\/2, somewhere plus 1\/2 of that. I don't have that in front of me, Glenn. But it's somewhere around there.","And there will be, by the way, there will be an integrated sales piece this year related to Open. I mean, we have some good momentum there, and so there's -- that revenue synergy, that annual revenue will have a good year this year and more momentum as we head into '15.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just a different direction. You may have referenced this at the Analyst event, but maybe for Jeff, any change in your international aspirations? Ambitions there?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","No, I mean we laid out 3 or 4 areas at Investor Day that we feel are good opportunities for us. They link to where we have competencies, they link to where we have relationships and leadership. And we shared -- there were a couple of areas in payments and some interesting areas in the account processing area. And what we said is, we expected upon execution that, that would add about 1% of incremental internal revenue growth in 2016. So we're executing that. It's early, but we remain confident that we can grow that piece of the business. Obviously, the substantial majority of our growth is coming from the U.S. operations. And so this is kind of an add-on, so when we talk about our results, just don't have a meaningful -- at the enterprise-level, we just don't have a meaningful international growth in our numbers.","Thomas J. Hirsch","We're going to be careful, as Jeff kind of hit on, around our business model, which is really again, focused on high-quality revenue, accretive to operating margins with a very high cash flow conversion. You can see the strength of kind of our business model this past year with the -- our free cash flow per share at $3.33, 10% again, ahead of our -- on top of our adjusted earnings per share. So we're going to be very focused on having the right business models internationally that are going to kind of have those long recurring revenue streams, and it's very important in our discipline in that regard.","Mark A. Ernst","The key implication of that is, even the efforts that we have underway today are not going to show up in revenue growth for a couple of years.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Understood. Makes sense. One more quick question, just in terms of the fiscal '14 organic growth. Does it assume any meaningful pickup in the cash hedge P2P business? Or sort of still, sort of working to preserve[ph] the revenue business model there?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I think it will assume meaningful increase in transactions, but not a meaningful increase in revenue. It's still quite early.","Operator","David Togut from Evercore.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Can you just quantify your expected operating margin expansion, between your Payments and Financial segments?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, we don't give guidance at that particular level on a segment basis. I think, again, we don't see anything from a standpoint -- overall, our margin guidance is greater than 50 basis points. So I don't see any large variations from a standpoint of what we anticipate in the future, any unusual items from either segment as I sit here today. So I don't think there's going to be anything unusual from a modeling standpoint.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, could you call out the termination fees in the fourth quarter of '13, and then the fourth quarter of '12?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, our overall, excluding Open Solutions, our term fees in the quarter were up about $5 million to $6 million, but our license revenue was down about the same amount. So they were up a little bit from a term fee standpoint, excluding Open and again, down on license fee. For the full year standpoint, excluding Open, yes, our term fees were flat, and our license revenue was down about $10 million to $15 million. And that again, is around, as Jeff and Mark have kind of highlighted really, a big focus on the recurring revenue, our Mobiliti platform, those types' demands in the marketplace where the license revenue has kind of come down from those levels.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. If I can just sneak in one last question, do you have any major bill pay renewals in 2014? And could you just give us an idea of how we should be thinking of bill pay transaction growth for '14?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, we don't give kind of -- we wouldn't be giving transaction growth guidance on a solution-by-solution basis. We expect to have good, solid growth in that business again this year. Each year, we have some larger renewals and this year is not dramatically different than kind of a normal year.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, we'll have a couple, as we normally do.","Operator","Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Can you update us on the Open Solutions contribution to total revenue in the quarter? Is that anything you've ever broken out or would consider?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, you actually -- I mean, for a large part, we disclose our acquired revenue. We're not going to do that on a go-forward basis, but clearly, that is the -- primarily the acquired revenue associated with Open that you see in the press release.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. Another question, in terms of the real-time payments capability, I mean Popmoney is more of a consumer solution, but it would seem like the real-time capability could really help any business that has to authorize transactions up front, only to settle from the backend with ACH later, which obviously can lead to meaningful amounts of fraud loss. So are you speaking with or contemplating speaking with any non-bank, heavy ACH settlers, I'm thinking like a PayPal or I know, Target Red card would be something where they're having to off the transaction and then settle with ACH later. I mean, how broad could your use case become for real time, outside of sort of what you're -- what you've sort of discussed to date?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","There is no question that the use case, the use case is, I mean you take something like Popmoney, right, I mean that is a very basic real-time use case, being able to have an expedited bill payment, that's a pretty basic use case. So C2C use cases are kind of the easy ones. C2B use cases get a little bit -- you kind of have that ladder of complexity or opportunity. I mean, we have thought about this very broadly in terms of the network effect possibilities. By the same token, we want to drive significant value for issuers. I mean, we certainly have relationships with merchants and billers, but we have larger relationships with issuers. And so we're really focused on the issuer base right now. We're building the capability to be used as broadly as it can be used. But right now, issuers are our primary focus. And we do see, again, talking to issuers, we talked about this at Investor Day that, I think we used U.S. Bank and PNC as examples of large institutions who were thinking about real-time, and we talked about U.S. Bank using our PEP+ direct connect capability as their real-time engine, right? If U.S. Bank decides to make that available to a merchant or a biller, that's fantastic, because they'll drive revenue from that. But we, at this stage, that is where our focus is, on the issuers.","Operator","Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan Securities.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just -- I always follow through with the pipeline, forgive me, but just wanted to ask again about sales conversions and timeliness of backlog conversion, things like that. Any change in what you're hearing on the ground there?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","No, I mean, I think actually, our pipeline is in pretty good shape. We had a big fourth quarter, and we have a healthy pipeline. I mean, we'd always like that pipeline to be larger, but I mean we're going to actually end up -- we had a very strong January. We announced, obviously, the Washington Federal deal, that was a large deal. So I mean, we're in good shape on that front. Now as we move through the year, we'll expect that pipeline to build, especially as we start thinking through some of the International opportunities. So the pipe feels like it's in reasonable shape, given where we are and the strong finish to Q4. On the conversion timelines, it's one of the things I was talking about earlier, in that we do see some slippage there, right? There continues to be some challenges, especially in the largest banks, in terms of how they're prioritizing everything from last-minute regulatory changes, to changes and challenges to the revenue model. So we don't -- we're not anticipating -- I'd say it this way, we're not anticipating any aggressiveness or acceleration in implementation timelines and, in fact, I would say, if you pressed us, we would probably say that we would see more slippage, as opposed to acceleration anywhere. And we've accounted for that, generally accounted for that in our guidance this year.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm asking because we cover some of the systems integrators as well, and we hear mixed things, but it does feel like there's a mix shift towards some of the mobility and some of the digital stuff that you're talking about. And of course, they're cutting in other areas also to reduce cost, so how does -- how do you think the Fiserv portfolio fits if that theme plays out, because you sit in a lot of different places. If you think there'll be more volatility this year or less, in terms of conversion? I caught what you said about the slippage, but just trying to understand a little bit deeper the secular implication, if that question makes sense.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, so if you take it down to the product portfolio level, clearly, since 2007, we have seen less discretionary spending across the entire portfolio. If you interject the impact of digital and specifically mobile, tablet, those kinds of things, you're exactly right. We've seen a product go from 0 to really commanding a significant amount of the incremental spend. And because we know what IT spend is, obviously, something's got to give. The good news for us is, most of what we had been doing discretion -- on a discretionary basis, has already left our portfolio. We still have, believe me, we still have plenty of opportunities to see reduction. But a lot of what we do, a substantial majority of what we do, sits in these mission-critical places like core and ACH and Online Banking, and it's all kinds of transaction processing which is just not -- it's not going to be -- that's not going to be on a discretionary basis. And because we don't have a gigantic services and license portfolio, a lot of what our revenue is, is on a click basis. We aren't seeing the kinds of big pressure that I think systems integrators may, in fact, be seeing. It does put more pressure on -- kind of the speed in which mobile and digital is moving, puts more pressure on us to invest and to continue to make sure that we have the right products. As we showed at Investor Day and we referenced again today, we've completely reengineered our Corillian ASP experience, and that experience, which really reflects what's going on in the world today, I mean that takes investment. So those kinds of things do, on the bottom side, cause us to spend more money. But I think, as I think about our portfolio versus other portfolios, I think we have a portfolio that is biased to more growth over time and, frankly, more quality growth, as Tom talked about just a few minutes ago.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. Just one quick follow-up. The Open, how did that come in versus plans?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I would say that on virtually every front, Open has outperformed our expectations. And there were lots of stories out there about the product, and you worry sometimes that, that's not product it's people. I mean this is a great group of people, we're excited that we have them in the company. The clients, I mean just -- I mean, considering it was a competitive acquisition we use to compete, the clients have been so open to the kinds of capabilities that we can bring. It's -- that's been frankly tremendous. The cost we got out, as Tom referenced, we got out a little bit quicker than we thought we would. And we have another phase of consolidation that we'll be working on this year, that'll show up next year. And then on the revenue side, we're going to sell hard and I think that will all be positive. 31 wins as compared to 10 last year and, in fact, of those 10, only 3 of them were within their own shops, 7 of them, they were actually through resellers, so that's all been great. I would say on the not-as-good front, frankly, there just wasn't as much current revenue as we were anticipating in 2013. Our current revenue was lower, and it was lower because we didn't get the level of reseller revenue that we had anticipated -- or I wouldn't even say that we anticipated -- that was built into their model. And surprisingly, the number of termination fees was dramatically less because we didn't lose very many clients. So that's bad news up front, but not having resellers in the base, not having termination fees in the base, we think it's very good, and we still feel like, as Tom shared at Investor Day, that we'll end up -- this will end up being somewhere 4 or less, on an EBITDA multiple basis.","Operator","Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Jeff, there's been a lot of talk about branch consolidation or at least banks looking to do there. Is there any positive or negative impact to Fiserv because of that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Probably some positive and some negative impact to Fiserv. I mean, I would say in the near term, as -- if you think about as banks consolidate, I mean there could be some seat implications and things like that on teller systems or source capture licenses and those kinds of things. But on balance, the notion of branch consolidation I think is a very good thing for us because we sit in a very prime spot as it relates to providing the technologies that are going to be required to interact and build relationships with consumers. And I think probably the thing that is most missed when we think about digital, is if branches really consolidate, I mean, I think the -- if you think about the key change in the model, which is probably 20, 30 years away, right, as people like me die off, you're going to have the requirement for the technology to facilitate the equivalent of a face-to-face relationship. And the dependence on that technology and the predictive ability that'll be necessary in that technology, those kinds of things will drive significant revenue opportunities for the companies who can figure that out. And, frankly, we believe that we may not be ahead of the curve, but we're on the curve, and we're focused on that. I mentioned that we have 22 patent applications filed in 2013, it's because we're creating new innovation that is focused on this converging technology. So I think over the long haul, it'll be good for us. It'll probably be good for all the providers. And it's hard for me to see how it becomes bad. I think you'll see video and other kinds of technologies play an important role in that. So right now, I would say, it's interesting, but I don't think there's a significant impact on us, so long as the institutions themselves are able to keep up with that trend.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Fair. And just one last question. Mark, you talked about RFPs, and maybe last year some of the credit union RFPs were created because of Open Solutions and maybe what you were trying to get accomplished. I mean, as you look into 2014, is there any difference that you're seeing in spending between credit unions and banks? Or is it more normalized?","Mark A. Ernst","Well, I'd say it looks different. You have much more kind of active consolidation and trends there in the banking side of the business than you do on the credit union side. But even there, you still have some of that going on in the credit union side of the industry. Probably on balance, credit unions are more likely to look at technology to better enable member service, and therefore, they may be kind of more on the leading-edge, looking for new technology. And I don't think there's any indication that's different in '14 than where it's been. But on balance, I don't know that we see different things going into '14 than where we've been, other than the fact that the issues with the Open acquisition and the various kind of financials -- credit unions in particular that were in motion, that had to settle out in '13, that's behind us now. So I think that's the big change, going into '14.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We know we went a little bit longer than we thought we would.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Peter Poillon, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Peter Poillon","Thank you, Ivy, and good afternoon, everyone. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chairman and Chief Executive; Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter and full-year are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from our recent acquisition of First Data. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.

For additional historical combined financial information, please refer to the Form 8-K, which we filed on October 3.","As a reminder, we'll host an Investor Conference on March 25 in New York City. We expect the presentation to run from about 8:30 AM to noon, and we\u2019ll also host a lunch following the program. We look forward to seeing you at this important event.","And now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. 2019 was a year of transformation, growth and excellent financial performance. It was just over a year-ago that we announced our plans to transform the industry through the acquisition of First Data and just over 180 days since we've closed.","At the announcement, we shared our belief that First Data was a stronger business than people understood and that the industrial logic of the combination was incredibly compelling. We continue to get positive market feedback as we center on creating long-term and differentiated value for clients.","Although the transaction has only been closed for a short time, we've made substantial progress against our goals and are even more bullish about the scope of opportunities for the combined company.","Our key tenants of shareholder value, high-quality recurring revenue growth, expanding operating margin, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, were on full display in 2019. Our financial performance included internal revenue growth of 6%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points, and we achieved our 34th year in a row of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.","Importantly, free cash flow was up 16% to more than $3 billion, driven by excellent free cash flow conversion of 118%. Sales were strong, accelerating to 15% growth in the quarter and up 10% for the year. We repaid debt as promised, divested several businesses and restarted our programmatic share buybacks earlier than anticipated. These outstanding results combined to deliver total shareholder return of 57% in 2019 and it was also up 118% and 226% for the three and five-year periods respectively.","Turning to 2020. Our performance outlook of higher internal revenue growth, superior operating margin expansion, adjusted EPS growth in the mid-20s and strong free cash flow is a great start to what we believe will be an outstanding decade for your company.","Results for the fourth quarter were right in line with the guidance we provided in Q3. Internal revenue growth of 5% was led by another excellent quarter in our merchant business, up 9% in the quarter and 10% for the full-year.","Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was up 18% to $1.13 and adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points to 31.4%. Free cash flow was outstanding, reaching nearly $1 billion in the quarter. Full-year internal revenue growth was up a very strong 6%, adjusted earnings per share was up 16% to $4 and adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points to 29.7%.","Free cash flow for the full-year increased 16% to $3.3 billion. We are intensely focused on growing high-quality free cash flow and allocating that capital in a way that optimizes long-term shareholder value on both an overall and per share basis.","We continue to see strategic, operational and market proof points, which taken together reinforces the power of the combination. Momentum is strong and our opportunity to differentiate is greater than ever. The privileged relationships we have in our account processing businesses are critical in our strategy to serve clients exceptionally well.","One of our key priorities is to deeply integrate high value solutions, such as our bank merchant offering, which enables our clients to generate revenue while serving their most important customers. Along those lines, we signed 24 new account processing clients in the quarter, including 10 on DNA, such as AgFirst Farm Credit Bank with more than $34 billion in assets; American Eagle Financial Credit Union, the largest community-based credit union in Connecticut with $1.8 billion in assets; and Independent Bank with $3.6 billion in assets.","Our Clover platform has continued its stellar growth, increasing its annualized gross payment volume by more than 40% year-over-year. Payment devices shipped was up 25% for the year and the adoption of add-on Clover services continues to increase across the growing base.","We recognized the strategic importance of technology-oriented merchant acquiring and are focused on sustainably growing our ISV and ecommerce footprints through both sales and innovation. We continued to see digital momentum, signing more than 80 new direct ecommerce clients for the year and 23 in the fourth quarter alone.","Ecommerce transactions were up 30% for the year, reflecting the continuing strength of digital commerce globally. Our focus on delivering customer-based digital innovation, led to the recent connected commerce announcement, enabling Exxon and Amazon Alexa to team up the gas pump, utilizing voice-based technology.","We continue to see significant growth potential in our integrated payments business, where our ISV partners grew more than 25% for the year. Importantly, ISV revenue grew by nearly 60% in 2019 and we expect to see continuing strong growth moving forward.","Our merchant business also continues to perform well outside the United States, signing Delta Air Lines for acquiring services across several international regions. We also renewed our important merchant JV relationship in January with ICICI, one of India's leading banks, which positions us for further expansion in that important growth market.","ZA Bank is one of the first institutions to have been granted a virtual banking license in Hong Kong and has chosen Fiserv to manage its card processing, and Vietcombank, one of Vietnam's leading banks with more than 17 million accounts went live in January on our flexible and scalable signature international core processing platform.","With that, let me turn the call to Frank to provide an update on our integration and synergy progress.","Frank Bisignano","Thanks Jeff, and good afternoon. It's wonderful to be here today, discussing the creation of new Fiserv to best-in-class integration. We are making great progress serving clients, enhancing our growth profile through revenue synergies, and moving the needle on cost actions.","At the same time, as you can see from our strong 2019 results, we remain focused on profitably growing our existing business to deliver shareholder value. We were excited to start the new decade by being named as a FORTUNE Magazine World's Most Admired Company for the seventh year in a row. This recognition is a testament to the hard work, dedication and commitment of our associates around the world. I am personally very proud to be part of this team.","As you know, we set initial five-year targets of at least $500 million of revenue synergies and $900 million of cost benefits. The pipeline reminds that we are highly confident in achieving these targets and continue to identify ways in which we can overachieve in terms of both quantum and timing.","We continue to advance a growing list of revenue synergies designed to deliver additional client value and incremental revenue growth. These initiatives represent a solid mix of near and long-term opportunities, which should enable us to serve clients in a way that will drive enhanced growth and profitability for Fiserv over the next decade.","We continue to see better than expected results in our bank merchant program for Fiserv account processing clients. We signed 44 new clients in the fourth quarter, more than tripling the signings in Q3 and signed over 50 for the year. We are seeing a good balance between de novo programs and competitive takeaways, which are running about one-third of the signings, higher than anticipated at this stage.","We exited the year with more than 300 institutions in the pipeline and continue to believe we will exceed the $200 million revenue synergy target for this very important initiative. In addition to make bank merchant services, there is a large opportunity to cross-sell solutions around the world where one or both of the original firms has an influential relationship. Examples include CheckFree, Dovetail, Payments Hub, DNA, credit card processing and output solutions.","We continue to be bullish on the revenue synergy opportunities emerging from network innovation. The combination of STAR and ACCEL as the third largest debit network in the U.S. provides us with significant opportunity to differentiate with issuers and merchants.","Importantly, we are on track to deliver at least $100 million of revenue synergies in 2020 and are well on track to meet or exceed our initial $500 million revenue target. We are also making excellent progress against our cost synergy objective of at least $900 million.","Our initial focus is to streamline our cost structure through enhanced efficiency, increased operational rigor, and a significant focus on our $4 billion of annual vendor spend. We attained $46 million of cost synergies in 2019 and are continuing to grow a level of annualized run rate savings. We expect incremental cost synergies of more than $300 million in 2020 and given the combination of visibility in actions to-date also anticipate very strong cost synergy performance in 2021.","We are pleased with our performance to-date and have increasing confidence in our objective to exceed the original synergy targets over the five-year period. We will provide a full update of both cost and revenue synergy targets at our March Investor Conference. Since the time of the transaction announcement, we have gotten questions on how the original Fiserv operational effectiveness program would intersect with the cost synergy program.","We see a number of opportunities to operate our business more efficiently, while enhancing our client experience through innovation, such as RPA, cloud and process reengineering, which we believe will also provide additional economic opportunity beyond the cost synergy program. And important 2020 priority is to continue working collaboratively with Bank of America on a joint venture dissolution, which is slated for June 2020.","The discussions are progressing very well and both parties are focused on ensuring the delivery of great service to our shared clients. We continue to believe that the financial impact of the VAM separation will be generally accretive to our results over the next few years.","Overall, there's nothing more important than delivering on the promise of new Fiserv. Our unifying purpose across the enterprise is to build an extraordinary company for our clients, associates and shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide detail on our financial results.","Robert Hau","Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon. Let me start off by saying that we feel great about our financial performance and have confidence in our ability to create sustained value for clients and shareholders.","Internal revenue growth was 5% as expected in the quarter and 6% for the year. We were pleased to see modest contributions from a revenue synergies, which we believe will accelerate to at least $100 million in 2020.","Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $1.2 billion in the quarter and was up 8% to $4.3 billion for the year, which includes an early contribution from synergies. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 100 basis points to 31.4%.","The improvement was driven by a combination of continued revenue growth, the lapping of prior year's tax reinvestment, and the early benefits from synergies, partially offset by the expected lower periodic revenue compared to the fourth quarter last year.","Adjusted operating margin for the full-year was up 100 basis points to 29.7% driven by improved revenue growth, cost efficiencies, and a modest impact from early synergy realization.","Adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 18% to $1.13 in the quarter and increased 16% to $4 for the year, which also marked our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. These results include a negative impact from foreign currency of $0.02 and $0.11 per share for the quarter and full-year respectively.","As you know, we intend to modify our segment structure in 2020 and we'll report our future results on that basis. We expect to file an 8-K in March that will provide the new segments along with comparable financial information on a quarterly basis for 2018 and 2019.","Now on to the segments. Internal revenue growth in the First Data segment continued to be strong at 6% in the quarter and 7% for the year. This performance included outstanding results in the former GBS segment, delivering 9% growth in the quarter and 10% for the full-year. Internal revenue growth in GBS North America was a very solid 6% in both the quarter and year.","And as we mentioned in our Q3 call, we don't intend to provide this level of sub segment detail beginning in 2020. Global merchant acquiring both at the physical point of sale and in digital markets were important contributors to our 2018 growth with strong performance in India, Brazil, and Argentina.","Additionally, we saw solid performance in our domestic business, including continuing strength in our digital commerce solutions. Our ISV partners grew by more than 25% for the year, translating to almost 25,000 new ISV merchant locations. Importantly, the number of global contracted merchant locations in 2019 expanded by double-digits.","We also continue to expand our leadership position and card issuing with worldwide accounts on file up solidly in the mid-single digits for the full-year. Segment adjusted operating income increased 6% to $708 million in the quarter and was up 5% to $2.7 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 50 basis points to 31.9% in the quarter and 30.7% for the year driven primarily by strong revenue growth.","The original Fiserv Payments segment delivered the internal revenue growth of 4% in the quarter and 5% for the year, impacted as expected in the quarter by lower periodic revenue. We saw strong segment growth performance in card services, output solutions and some early network revenue synergy benefits.","Our adjusted operating income for the segment was excellent, growing 12% to $353 million in the quarter and up 11% to $1.3 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was outstanding up a very strong 250 basis points to 39.2% and was up 70 basis points to 36.3% in the year. This increase was generally from growth in high quality revenue, the reduction of last year's tax funded investments and the benefits from productivity and early synergy performance.","Transactional businesses performed well with debit transactions up in the high-single digits for the quarter and year, and Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 11% in the quarter to more than $9 million.","P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle, continued their rapid growth, doubling versus Q4 last year and up 18% sequentially. Zelle transactions tripled in 2019 and the number of live clients increased tenfold compared to a year-ago. Zelle signings were also very strong for the year, almost doubling to more than 360, which included 112 in the fourth quarter alone.","Internal revenue in the Financial segment for the quarter was flat as expected, driven by a much lower periodic revenue, partially offset by gains in high quality recurring revenue. For the full-year, internal revenue growth was up 3% led by our account and item processing businesses.","Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was flat in the quarter at $207 million and it was up 1% to $805 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points in the quarter to 34.1% with the benefit of growing recurring revenue and operational effectiveness more than offsetting the impact of lower periodic revenue.","Adjusted operating margin for the full-year was up 20 basis points to 33.5%, which is the highest level attained in the last several years. The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter was flat to the prior year at $100 million and down 11% to $414 million for the full-year, primarily due to combination of cost synergies and operational efficiency benefits in both original companies.","The adjusted effective tax rate came in slightly better than expected at 22.8% for the quarter and 21.4% for the year, primarily due to higher than expected benefits and stock-based compensation. Due to the transaction close, we expect this benefit to be reduced in 2020 and become a bit of a tax rate headwind with the largest impact, likely in Q1. Accordingly, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 to be in the range of 22% to 23%.","Free cash flow of $984 million in the quarter was driven by a combination of strong operating results and some benefit from settlement timing in our merchant business. Full-year free cash flow was up a very strong 16% to $3.3 billion and free cash flow conversion was 118%. We expect to see continued free cash flow benefits from the utilization on the First Data tax NOL in 2020.","We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $238 million in the quarter and 4.2 million shares to nearly $400 million in the year. We are pleased to have reentered a more regular cadence on share repurchase, which should carry into 2020. As of December 31, we had 680 million shares outstanding and 22 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase.","Total debt outstanding, which is about 78% fixed rate was $21.9 billion and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.8x as of December 31. We repaid nearly $600 million of debt in the quarter and remain committed to returning our historic leverage level within 18 to 24 months through a combination of debt repayment and strong EBITDA growth.","In December, we announced an agreement to sell a 60% interest in our investment services business to Motive Partners. Along with entering into a joint venture, we expect to receive approximately $510 million of net after-tax proceeds from the sale, which will be primarily redeployed to share repurchase.","Overall, the net expected dilution from our [four] 2019 divestitures should be about $0.05 in 2020. We will continue to use our portfolio management discipline to ensure we have the optimal mix of businesses to deliver sustained client and shareholder value in your company.","In conjunction with the First Data merger, we've recorded a non-cash impairment charge and the GAAP results in the quarter associated with an international core account processing platform.","Lastly, using the midpoint of our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance, we will have already achieved approximately 25% accretion from the First Data transaction. We will remain on track to meet or exceed our commitment of more than 40% accretion over the five-year synergy period.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned upfront, market momentum continued in Q4 with a 15% increase in sales, for the second quarter in a row and with strong performance across several areas, including Bank Solutions, Card Services, Merchant Solutions, and Biller. The Q4 results are even more noteworthy considering original Fiserv sales results in the comparable period were at a record level.","On a combined basis, sales was up 10% for the year and our pipeline remains strong. We are seeing synergy opportunities grow as the market explorers the benefits of new Fiserv, which we believe will lead to incremental revenue growth in 2020 and beyond.","For original Fiserv, integrated sales was up 41% sequentially and up 5% for the year. During the fourth quarter, we achieved $11 million of operational effectiveness benefits and $47 million of savings in 2019, which completes our five-year $250 million program one-year early.","As you know, we provided a preliminary view of 2020 performance in Q3 and our actual 2020 outlook is right in line with that preview. We expect constant currency internal revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year with growth rate acceleration coming from continuing strength in our global merchant business, the cumulative impact of sales and implementations and the achievement of in-year revenue synergies.","We expect 2020 adjusted earnings per share growth of 23% to 27% or $4.86 to $5.02 of the revised 2019 results of $3.95, which reflects the net divestiture impact Bob mentioned earlier. Our outlook also contains negative FX impact of approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per share, which is incremental to the decline in 2019. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and that free cash flow conversion will be greater than 112% for the year.","For modeling purposes, we expect our Q1 results to be pressured by the comparison against last year strongest quarter, which also had a high level of non-recurring and periodic revenue. Additionally, we expect revenue growth and earnings to build sequentially throughout the year as action plans are executed and costs and revenue synergies fold into our results.","Overall, we expect the quantum of these benefits and the impact to our P&L to be sustainably higher in the second half of the year, which should also provide a strong jumping off point as we enter 2021. 2019 was a watershed year for Fiserv. We were again named a world's most admired company, achieved our 34th consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth, and most importantly acquired First Data and a market defining transaction that significantly advanced our aspiration of moving money and information in a way that moves the world.","We are excited to enter a new decade of growth and opportunity. We believe we have assembled the strongest client-centric solutions in the industry, the best associate team, and are focused on delivering above market returns for you, our shareholders.","As we close, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world who work relentlessly to serve clients and to deliver Fiserv at our best.","With that, Ivy, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We would now like to open the lines for any questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question in queue is Brett Huff from Stephens. Your line is open.","Brett Huff","Good afternoon, guys, and congrats on a nice quarter and a first annual outlook.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff","Just quick questions on as we look in kind of a numerate, and Frank, you talked a little about this. As you think about the various categories of revenue synergies, you mentioned network synergies, card issuing, things like that. If you \u2013 would you order the priority of those for us and now that you've kind of been in at this for six months or so and give us a little bit more color on each of those buckets?","Frank Bisignano","Well, bank merchant and the merchant opportunity we would put at the highest level. And you see that performing and how we're signing it up. And when Jeff and I thought about this, we always thought that that we would have a strategic advantage with the Clover platform and great privilege position in core processing, account processing and along without deep bank relationships.","Second, bringing together of these two networks is a very, very unique opportunity that takes us \u2013 we were already in some cases, number three, when you put it together, or a powerful number three. But we have this merchant business that affords our clients opportunity. So you're watching the client centricity of these opportunities that are good for our shareholders and good for our clients.","And then the ability to take the privileged positions, both companies had with the long list of the assets, Output is a very strong product. We know that we can have CheckFree and our Payments Hub, Dovetail, all those are very strong opportunities in the cross-sell.","And as Jeff talked about, the market reaction is every time we\u2019re together with a client, we get this very deep feeling of even more we can do for them. And we look forward to Investor Day talking more deeply about that.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. Brett, I would say, I think Frank is exactly right. The only other thing I would say is as we continue to have the privilege of spending more time together, we are identifying more and more unique opportunities. We currently have more than 80 different revenue synergy opportunities in play, and that list continues to grow.","And so the beauty of this is not only do we see opportunities to deliver value as we've talked about, whether it's in the Bank Merchant, Network and Output, kind of some of the nearer in opportunities, but the ability to drive continuing value through the wonderful solutions and people that we have in the organization were increasingly bullish. And again, we'll spend more time on that in March.","Brett Huff","That's great. My quick follow-up is, the bigger picture longer-term idea of owning both the funding account in the merchant point-of-sale that was I know one of the things on the list that intrigued you about the combination. As you \u2013 again, as you're six months into this, what is your view on that? Has it changed? Has it evolved at all? Gotten more concrete? Thanks for the questions.","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure, Brett. And I would say that it continues to evolve. We believe that there is, again, kind of an even more increased privileged position where you can have access to the transactional account with all of the evolution that's happening in the Payment space around real-time money movement. And we continue to see that as a very interesting future opportunity and that would be incremental to the kinds of opportunities that we see today. And so we continue to be very excited about that.","Brett Huff","Great. Thanks guys.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Next, David Koning with Baird. Your line is open.","David Koning","Yes. Hey, guys. Great year.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks David.","David Koning","Yes. I guess, my first question, when we think a 6% to 8% growth, I mean that's very encouraging and is it both segments, both Fiserv and First Data accelerating like \u2013 is Fiserv is going to be five-ish and First Data seven to nine. Is that kind of what we should be thinking of?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. So Dave, I would say that, as Bob talked about, we will be moving away from our traditional segment structure and we'll move to a new segmentation and we would expect each of those areas to continue to grow. I would say if you went back to the old kind of the original structures, we would expect to see our Payment segment have incremental growth, really driven by strength in our digital and mobile capabilities in Zelle, in Network, some of those areas, so around card processing in on-balance. So we would expect that to grow.","As we talked about before, we would expect to see some level of improvement in the traditional financial segment. But as you know that segment both produces good solid returns and margins on a standalone basis, but also does the double duty of being a hub for us to deliver future and integrated value through other solutions, whether it be Bank Merchant, Card or any of the other capabilities that we have. So a longer answer, but yes, we would expect to see acceleration in each of the different traditional segments on balance.","David Koning","Great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up, free cash flow incredibly strong over 112%. I think is what you said you're guiding to. And I know that includes a little bit of NOL. Is there a way to think of what that is without the NOL maybe on a longer-term basis? Is it still like 105 or something like that?","Jeffery Yabuki","I would say and Bob will certainly add in here. There's no reason to believe that our free cash flow performance will be below what it had been historically.","David Koning","Okay.","Jeffery Yabuki","Which is in that range, David.","Robert Hau","Yes, absolutely right way to look at it. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Dave, we've got the NOL benefit repeating, reoccurring in 2020, and have expectation of at least 112%, longstanding above 100% for the company going back many, many years. Expect to see that going forward.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. I would say, Dave, the only other caveat to keep in mind, and it's not an annual caveat, but it's a quarterly caveat, in that depending on the days that the quarters end and everything else, you could have some merchant settlement moving up and down. So you'll have a little bit more of that between quarters. But on an annual basis, we are absolutely committed to running free cash ahead of normal earnings.","David Koning","Great. Thanks, guys.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","Hey, thanks guys.","Jeffery Yabuki","Hi, Darrin.","Darrin Peller","I just want to start off the Q4 results. Hey, how are you? If you normalize for the periodic revenues you talked about, I guess what would you \u2013 what kind of impact that have on the quarters' internal growth of 5%? And then just thinking about the outlook is 6% to 8% range. I mean, what would go right for the top end of that? What do you expect to be? Are you just being conservative for the six part of it? Just a little bit more color would be great. Thanks guys.","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. So if you think about the \u2013 it's hard to talk about it in terms of the entire business, because obviously a fair amount of the periodic revenue comes out of the traditional or the original Fiserv business. But in the original Fiserv business, it's kind of a little bit more than a point of revenue growth.","We gave up because of the periodic revenue and we also have had a drag most of the year in our Biller Solutions business, where we had a large client grow over from the prior year. And so those kinds of negatives are running through \u2013 certainly running through Q4 and did have an impact.","Again, consistent with what we laid out in Q3, but on an absolute basis that would have been the case. Going into 2020, we feel really good about where we sit. We had 15% sales growth in Q4. We had 15% sales growth in Q3. And one of the great things about that is we were worried what might happen with the market freeze up and what we saw is very strong growth. And so that 30% growth in the last six months of the year, we\u2019ll start to see some of that roll in.","And one of the levers that you could move us up on the continuum is faster implementations, faster growth of those clients. As you know, almost all of our clients end up ramping up. I think the other thing would be do we see higher levels of performance outside the U.S. than we're planning for today. I think that could move us up on the continuum. And I think the last thing would be faster realization of revenue synergies.","And so as Frank talked about, whether it\u2019s Bank Merchant, Network, Output, those kinds of areas could all conspire to have higher growth kind of move us up to the top end. But nothing has changed from where we sat at Q3. We think this range is prudent, but our perspective is still the same as it was in Q3.","Darrin Peller","That's really helpful. Just one quick follow-up. The 40% growth in Clover, I mean that continues to be extremely strong, and does that still just the organic trend of follow-through from what First Data that already built or are you starting to see some benefits from cross-selling through the Fiserv banks or any other cross-sell in that front? Thanks, guys.","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. Thanks Darrin. I would say that there has been exactly no impact on the Clover GPV growth. In fact, each of the quarters for the year, Clover grew above 40%, really stellar performance and annualized run rate in excess of $100 billion. So we feel quite good about that.","And while we're excited about the progress that we've made on Bank Merchant, there's really been no contribution yet. And really I don't think we'll start to see any movement and contribution until the second half of next year.","And even that will take time to ramp as you've seen it up in Clover, historically for the great work that Frank and the team has done. But we do believe that's going to be a meaningful tailwind to growth over the next several years.","Darrin Peller","That's great. Thanks again guys.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Togut","Thanks. Good afternoon. As you sit down with your Bank and Credit Union CEOs to discuss 2020 spending priorities, first, what would you characterize as the top spending priorities for your Bank and Credit Union clients? How does your solution set match up against those? And then number two, how would you characterize the overall demand environment for 2020 in the core Fiserv financial sector based upon your conversations with the Bank and Credit Union CEOs?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. Thanks, David. I would say that the priorities for financial institutions in the U.S. are continuing as they were. I would say everything digital, whether it is on the consumer side, the small business side, the commercial side, that's really job one. Continuing to make the institutions more efficient through straight-through processing, right, digital really requires a straight-through processing. We're seeing a lot of discussion around money movement.","Frank made reference to the Dovetail, Payments Hub as one of the interesting cross-sell opportunities that we have as a result of the combination and that's really illustrative of modernizing the back office. So we continue to see that as a important priority.","And then third, I would say it's all about cyber, making sure that banks are doing everything they can to solidify their position around safety and soundness, right, which is instrumental to the banking system. So I would say those would be the top three priorities.","We're also seeing some modernization going on behind the scenes around the infrastructure that's required to operate in a digital kind of a \u2013 think about a digital real time, 24\/7 world. But that is still secondary to the first three items that we talked about. So that trend continues.","We think we are very well positioned in what we are doing today around digital. We've been talking about it for a while, whether it's around Mobiliti, our architect solution. It's helping to reenergize the account processing, the core banking space, both in the Bank and Credit Union side. We're making a lot of progress in our security solutions, and some of our other solutions that are around safety and soundness. So again, good progress there.","And third, Payments had been a big deal for us and so we continue to make progress overall. I would say that on balance to spend environment, if you would have asked me six months ago given were interest rates removing, I would have thought that we would see a more muted spend environment. The spend environment is actually held up. I think part of it is, were getting used to a lower spread world and banks realize they have to continue to spend.","You of course are seeing discretionary spending being pulled from places that may not be in the top priorities. But on balance, we remain bullish going into 2020 on the spend front with that segment of the base, including the synergy work, bank merchant and other areas, we're bullish and optimistic going into the year.","Operator","Thank you. Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line of open.","Ramsey El-Assal","Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the competitive takeaways specifically on the merchant services cross-selling into the banks. How can you kind of characterize the sort of secret ingredient to picking off those relationships? Is it Clover? Is it more just focused sales attention? Is it bundling with other services? Like what's giving you the sort of torque in those negotiations in order to sort of pick off the customers?","Jeffery Yabuki","So I would say that, we have for years talked about the importance of the core processing as a hub to a strategically privileged relationship. And so I would say at the top of the house is that relationship that we have with clients.","However, it's really been complimented beautifully by the technological innovation that Clover brings to the party and offers banks an opportunity to bring Apple like innovation to their commercial clients, to their small businesses. So from that perspective, those two items have been very important.","Thirdly, because of the privileged position we have, we've been driving deeper integration, integration into digital capability, integration into commercial cash management. And if we're working on innovation into our notify-a-learning hub, we're working on innovation that's going to allow banks to have deeper relationships with these small businesses and commercial customers.","So from that perspective, I would say that combination is what's allowed us to get off to such a good start, both as Frank talked about in the de novo space as well as in the competitive space. So on-balance good, and we're also seeing \u2013 I would have anticipated or I did anticipate that we would see smaller banks take the lead, and while they have almost 20% of the conversions are institutions that are greater than $1 billion of assets. So from that perspective, we feel good about the place and the reaction from the market.","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay, that's super, helpful. And then in light of some of the recent divestiture activity, how would you describe the collection of assets that you have now under the combined companies? Or is it sort of where you want it to be or should we expect kind of a steady stream of incremental divestitures as we move forward? ","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. Ramsey, we're still in the process of reviewing strategic fit and really making sure that we have the bandwidth to put effort into some of these businesses. So if you take the investment services business, which was the obviously the large divestiture we announced in the fourth quarter, we think that's a fantastic business.","We think with the right leadership and the right capital, that that is a wonderful business, which is why we kept 40% of the business, but we believed it needed additional management and the opportunity costs for us was too great given everything we have that Bob and Frank and I have been talking about.","So from that perspective, that was important. I would say that while you may see us do some trimming over time, we don't \u2013 we're not sitting here with a list of big divestitures that are coming. We're really looking and we like our portfolio a lot. I think we talked about it. We think we actually have the best solutions set in the industry in terms of growth capability, but really most important around client-centricity and the ability to move our clients forward with our solution.","Ramsey El-Assal","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Jeff Cantwell from Guggenheim Securities, your line is open.","Jeffrey Cantwell","Hi, good afternoon.","Jeffery Yabuki","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Cantwell","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Jeff, you just touched on this, but I wanted to ask you on something about what you're seeing right on the Fiserv side of the platform? And clearly, we've seen we've made a number of moves over the past couple of years, which you've positioned Fiserv quite well to capture market share.","And so just wondering if you could frame something for us? Where are you seeing the most significant change in client demand over time? Is it coming to you from smaller financial institutions? Is it coming from mid-size at FIs? Maybe it's coming from larger FIs. I was just curious if you can help us figure that out, because really just trying figure out, whose capturing share in each of the buckets looking at it like that. So it would be great if you could give us your thoughts on where you think you're taking share? Appreciate it.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Jeff. That's really interesting question. Yes, I would say that that we are taking share on balance in the areas where we have market strength. And I use that descriptor because it's less about is it in the small end of the base or in large end of the base, [indiscernible] the base, I mean the market, sorry.","And instead it's in places where we have solution strength that delivers value for clients. So if you are a small e-commerce merchant or a very large e-commerce merchant, and I think we indicated we signed roughly 80 new e-commerce logos during the year. Some of those are smaller and some of them are very important household names that we're all familiar with.","And so what we're seeing is more consistency around the decision making that's being made in the market. So really looking for quality more than any segment will accept something that isn't quality.","So from that perspective, whether it be a solution like CheckFree, RXP or Dovetail or our ISV solution or Ecommerce solution or Clover, you're seeing choices be made based on the quality of the solution. As it relates to kind of deeper into the segments, I would say, I feel right now across the enterprise that we're doing well, gaining share in the places that matter to us strategically, and that we\u2019re well positioned to continue to do that especially as we bring things together.","Probably the most important trend that we're seeing is, if you think about the low \u2013 below the top 60 or 70 banks, you're just continuing to see more move towards outsourcing, right. We have fantastic capabilities as an outsourcer that got even better through our combination with First Data. And so we're seeing more and more capability.","In fact, some of the more interesting opportunities that we have synergistically are in fact bringing things together with solutions that the original Fiserv had that we didn't offer on a hosted or ASP basis.","Jeffrey Cantwell","Great. Appreciate that. And then I think you said in your prepared remarks that you're growing by 25% in integrated, if I heard that correctly, which certainly sounds strong. So could you talk us a little more about that? Maybe tell us what's driving that? And also about the \u2013 maybe a little bit about the go-forward picture for yourselves in integrated? I'm just curious as to whether there's any specific verticals, for example, where are you seeing the strongest momentum and how sustainable you feel that growth is overall?","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. So Jeff, let me quickly give you the data and then I think Frank can add a little bit more color on that. In the ISV and the integrated payment space, I think we said we increased the number of ISV merchants by 25%, and revenue growth was up 60%, right, so a very strong year in that space.","We continue to make it a priority kind of taking on the way First Data that Frank and his team had done. We see lots of opportunity to grow. But let me have Frank give a little bit more color on that.","Frank Bisignano","Yes. In ISV, it\u2019s a very \u2013 as Jeff said in the earlier points, very technical product. It is not a vertical attempt tier. There's not a look at one single vertical. It's really across and it's really the technology solution. So I feel very comfortable that our solution plays in all spaces and we are winning across all spaces from car washes to retailers of different sizes and shapes. So it's not a vertical specific capability.","Jeffrey Cantwell","Okay. Thanks for all the color and congrats on the results.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks Jeff.","Frank Bisignano","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank, your line is open.","Bryan Keane","Hi guys. I want to ask about the Fiserv standalone. I know Fiserv started the year guiding to 4.5% to 5% internal revenue growth, but there's been some moving pieces with divestitures and obviously acquisitions came in. So just hoping to get a report card on how Fiserv standalone did versus original expectations?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. Thanks, Bryan. I would say that on balance, it was probably slightly lower than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year. The comparables are a little bit more difficult because upon the combination, we made some changes that had an impact to some of the revenue recognition and therefore some of the growth.","So we had some impact there, but I would say on balance slightly less than we would have expected. I would also say that when we closed in July, we've made a series of decisions around allocating resources to places that we didn't have in our sites originally.","And so from our perspective, we thought it was most important to make sure that we were getting the integration right, that we are focused on laying the track for synergies both on the cost and on the revenue side. And then third, just making sure that we're continuing to invest and have these capabilities ready to drive more growth this year, which we think they will.","Bryan Keane","Got it. Helpful. And then wanted to ask on the adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 250 basis points, how much that is from the core companies versus the synergies? Is there a way to break that out?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. Bryan, I would say that we're doing everything in our power to make sure that we're running the company on a kind of a combined single view. But the reality is, I think we said in our prepared remarks that we expected at least $300 million of cost synergies this year.","And so, therefore, a large part of the unusual gain in margin is going to come from that. I will also tell you that embedded in that, our investments that we are making that are required to drive revenue synergies that are kind of consuming some of the gains in margin.","So that $300 million is not a net number of all of the investments we have to make. But again to get to your exact question, a large part of that would be coming from the synergies, but we as a normal entity would continue to do the things that we would do to drive margin, if you think about original Fiserv, greater than 50 basis points per year.","Bryan Keane","Right. And just to be clear the $300 million in cost synergies, is that up from previous expectations?","Jeffery Yabuki","We have never guided in any year. We've said we expected to do $900 million over five years. And so we did $46 million \u2013 I think we did $46 million in the first five months that we were a combined company. We've said in our prepared remarks, we do at least $300 million this year. So we'll \u2013 and after 17 months will be roughly at least $346 million.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. Looking forward to the Analyst Day. Thanks, guys.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. Jason Kupferberg, your line is open, with Bank of America.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, thanks guys. Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up on a \u2013 I think it was Darrin's question earlier, just on the outlook for the 2020 organic. I think last quarter you had said at least 7%. Now we're refining it maybe around the edges a little bit and I guess 6% is in the equation here just \u2013 any particular reason why 6% is part of the guidance? It kind of sounds like you're thinking that the high end, the 8% is a lot more likely than the low end at 6%, but just wanted to understand the nuance there in terms of how the commentary evolved incrementally from last quarter?","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. So thanks Jason. I would say, and I tried to make this point clear in the prepared remarks that nothing has changed from our preliminary view that we gave in Q3. We continue to be confident in the numbers that we provided. We do believe it's prudent to have a range that is \u2013 that encompasses kind of 2 percentage points, and therefore, we thought 6% and 8% made sense.","The center point is not accidentally 7%. And so we feel good about where we are. And 7% is a very healthy gain over where we ended this year. And we feel like we \u2013 if we execute well and we believe we will, that we will not only increase our internal revenue growth rate this year, but we will be well positioned jumping off into 2021, given our commentary about how synergies will lay in and stronger performance in the second half of the year.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. That's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up. Digital distribution initiatives for Clover, any metrics you might be able to share there in terms of the percent of new activations that are maybe coming through digital channels now versus through physical bank branches? And how that mix is kind of evolving? I know that was a big focus for First Data heading into the merger?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. I would say, we still are very bullish on digital distribution as an opportunity for us, and we actually think that opportunity grew in the combination of Fiserv and First Data because of the fact that we now have not only more digital distribution points through the cash management and retail digital capabilities of the banks and credit unions that we will sign up, and the ability to be more targeted and on the data that we would use.","So we continue to believe that all makes sense. However, I would say that as we sit here today, the results of digital are quite low, probably immeasurable relative to the successes that we have had in other parts of the business. And so we will continue to grow that. And that the results, at least for the next couple of years are not contingent on us dramatically increasing digital distribution. We see that to be a journey. We're early in the journey and we'll continue to work at and knock it down.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust, your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate you squeezing me in here. Jeff, a lot of good stuff in terms of where you're investing in, and where you think the sweet spot is? And I just wonder if I could get your perspective on sort of the competitive environment there. There are a few things I think that have emerged of late. Temenos launched a new solution for Neobanks, a SaaS-based solution.","We saw the Worldline Ingenico deal yesterday. We saw BigCommerce, tap Barclaycard for Payments, also the rest of world developments for the most part, maybe Temenos domestic. I just wonder, you kind of kicked off this consolidation trend and now it seems like there are some new entrance. Can you just frame up your strengths and investment priorities against the competitive backdrop?","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. It's a great question. I'm not sure we can take credit for kicking off this entire trend, but I do think we can take credit.","Andrew Jeffrey","You were first.","Jeffery Yabuki","Well, thank you. I do think we can take credit for understanding between Frank and me and the rest of our team that the world was changing and that we felt like getting on the train early would be good for us, good for our clients, and obviously good for our shareholders.","And so the things that are happening right now are generally consistent with what we would have expected in terms of the overall transformation. When we think about this transformation that's going on, we see some things happening around the fringes. We see people coming together to create more \u2013 in some cases, more capacity to invest, in some cases, more unique partnerships, all of that recognizing the change that's going on.","And it's part of why we earmarked $500 million in incremental innovation to make sure that not only could we generate a significant amount of free cash flow so that we could allocate that to acquisitions and other inorganic uses of capital, but that we would be very focused on investing while we are restructuring and reshaping the company for the future.","So we actually take a fair amount of comfort in the things that are going on in the market because they do confirm for us that the world is changing. And I think you will see us look for our inherent competitive advantages. So we think we have a treasure trove of data. And so whether it's around fraud or better authorization rates or better ability to know your customer, better ability to make decisions on the basis of transactional data, we think that's quite important.","Investing in \u2013 and advancing our e-commerce capabilities, whether it is some of the voice that we talked about today, but really leveraging the unique strengths that we have because we have the ability to take advantage of the platforms that we're operating today and making them better. So whether it is moving to the cloud or using AI and RPA as ways to get there faster, we have all of that.","We have all of that capability. We're quite excited to do it. And I think we'll be able to share some of that in March. But I do think we're going to continue to see announcements that talk to the fact that the world is changing and it's incumbent upon us to make sure we're staying in front of that change, but really focused on the areas where we have strong competitive positions and that will make us stronger.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. George Mihalos from Cowen, your line is open.","George Mihalos","Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just had a follow-up question as it relates to the ISV channel and all the progress you're making there. Appreciate the commentary on the revenue growth being up. I think 60% you said, but can you actually size that business for us in terms of revenue dollars? I think the last time that First Data did that was back in 2018 when I think it was around $50 million or so?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. I would say George that compared to the $14.5 billion or so of revenue that we have, it's certainly a small \u2013 it's certainly on a relatively small base. But that relatively small base is growing quite comfortably and we're excited about that and we're also excited about using some of the competitively differentiated services that they have across other parts of the ecosystem. So it's again, a relatively small base, but growing in a very, very nice clip. And as you know, the space on balance relative to merchant acquiring globally is still quite small.","George Mihalos","Yes. Appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up, a housekeeping item for Bob. The nickel of dilution from the investment services majority sale. That is net of the $500 million being redeployed in buyback, right?","Robert Hau","Yes, that's correct. But more importantly that's actually an aggregation of [four] divestitures in total. So investment services being part of that, but yes, that capital redeployment is included in that calculation.","George Mihalos","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks George.","Operator","Thank you. And Chris Shutler with William Blair, your line is open.","Christopher Shutler","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just one quick one. Really good sales numbers again, that 10% for the year, would you confirm that is annual contract value, not TCV? And if so, could you give us the comparable numbers for the last couple of years? I think you previously reported it on a TCV basis?","Jeffery Yabuki","Yes. You're right, Chris. And we have changed our methodology to align with how First Data had talked about and reported sales. And so \u2013 but we have not talked about the quantum. We've always only talked about percent growth. But I would say that that percent growth is, obviously up 10% for the year, but importantly, up 30% over the last six months.","Christopher Shutler","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research, your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Hey, good afternoon.","Jeffery Yabuki","Hi, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta","Jeff, I wanted to just ask a little bit about the First Data SMB portfolio, especially in the U.S. I know, Frank, in the past you've talked about the attrition and core retention rate of that portfolio. And I'm just wondering where it stands today and just your opportunity to maybe improve the yield in that portfolio.","Frank Bisignano","Yes. As you probably remember the long journey that we took, but today we're in a much different place than when we started on the journey. I think we talk about being a gainer of share and growing our portfolio here.","And I think when you look at what attrition rates have done versus when we first started on it, they're practically in half. So we have a much different portfolio than when I talked two years ago, and I think you see it in the growth of the merchant numbers that we have in total.","Jeffery Yabuki","And I think Kartik, one other things that's interesting when you dig in and look at the data is you \u2013 not only is Clover really an attractive vehicle in the acquiring market. But the fact is that we see better retention and the beauty there is it's our platform, right. So we have add-on services that we talk about. So better retention, more services, happier clients. So it really is both sides and it's one of the things that the First Data team \u2013 the original First Data team had done quite well.","Kartik Mehta","And then just one last one, Jeff. Just as far as capital \u2013 use of capital is concerned. I know you said you're going back to buying back shares. I'm wondering what\u2019s your thoughts are on repaying debt in 2020. Well, maybe if you have a goal or something in mind for the debt for the company as we end this year?","Jeffery Yabuki","So Kartik, I would say that we've been very consistent since the time we announced that we were going into this transformative combination that we would repay debt and grow EBITDA at a healthy clip to get our debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to our historical levels. And I think we said we would do that over an 18 to 24-month period.","We ended the year at 3.8x. Bob paid down $600 million of debt in the fourth quarter. And so we'll continue to move down that path. The good news is we were able to move back to our programmatic buying at the very beginning of the fourth quarter. And so we think we have the firepower to do both and certainly we'll meet our commitments to the agencies.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thanks, Kartik.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, thank you for squeezing me in. I think you mentioned that you've signed 80 new direct-to-merchant e-com wins for the year in 2023 in the fourth quarter alone. This isn't a metric that First Data historically reported. So is this kind of growth a change from the historic win rates on direct-to-merchant e-com? And if so, I assume it is. What are you doing differently? And are you executing against a specific strategy to diversify away from processing for PayFac and going more direct-to-merchant in that business? Thank you.","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure, Lisa. Thanks. I would say that while we have not \u2013 while we have not shared that metric previously, as you know well, we think it's important that people understand that not only do we have strength through our very important joint venture partners.","But that on a direct basis, we are able to win business worldwide, and we think the fact that we won 80 logos for the year, and this is 80 new logos to the firm, which I think is quite important, again, 2024 in Q4, a range \u2013 granted a range of size of merchants, but some very important names.","So from that perspective, I would say it's a continuation of the strategy that Frank and his team started. But we have been putting more \u2013 and I don\u2019t what I mean me, I mean the collective company just putting more focus and energy, part of it is having a stronger technology platform, part of it is more focused on innovation, part of it is more sales focus, part of it is better service to existing clients, and so it's the entire gamut that Frank and the team started.","We're continuing to make it a high priority, as you and I have discussed. E-commerce and technology-based acquiring on balance is a very high priority for the company, just like SMBs and everything else. But obviously, this space is important and being a consistent share gainer is our absolute objective.","Lisa Ellis","Thank you. And then maybe my quick follow-up. On the issuer processing business is realizing, there's still sort of split in the current reporting across a couple of different segments. Can you just provide a little bit of color on how the combined issuer processing businesses are doing, and specifically combined revenue growth trajectory and how you're tracking so far on these synergies that you've been expecting across those two businesses as well, both domestically and internationally? Thank you.","Jeffery Yabuki","Sure. So Lisa, I would say that it probably will make more sense to cover this in-depth in \u2013 a little bit more depth in March. But at a high level, we are not \u2013 we have not combined our respective original issuer processing businesses. They run different platforms or different value propositions. We are looking to combine capabilities and move them more ubiquitously across platforms where it makes sense.","We're looking to make sure that we have the right clients on the right platforms where it makes sense. And so we liked the fact that we now both sides of the original organizations have more tools in the tool chest to go out and serve clients and win business.","I would say that that on the traditional, the traditional \u2013 the original First Data issuer processing business, specifically on the credit side, we're seeing some really interesting opportunities in the market. It's one of the places that you will see us invest kind of in thinking about more as next-gen \u2013 next-gen capabilities there. So very important, specifically on the credit side.","And also we're seeing a better than anticipated responsiveness in the Fiserv original clients both domestically and internationally in providing those kinds of capabilities, whether they be more integrated into the core systems in the U.S., but outside the U.S. sold into our larger signature or other relationships, we're seeing that to be a little bit better than we would have expected at this point.","Lisa Ellis","Excellent. Thank you. Thanks a lot.","Jeffery Yabuki","Thank you. And thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your support. We're excited for the future. If you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great evening.","Operator","Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line and have a great day or great evening."],"9578":["Fiserv, Inc.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","And at this time, I will turn the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Paul Seamon - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives, and the impact from tax reform. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons.","All of the share and per-share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials, and our comments are adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split completed in March of this year. Also, the 2017 full year, year to date, and quarterly adjusted earnings per share amounts have been adjusted for the impact of the sale of the majority interest of our Lending Solutions business that closed in March.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone.","Our business performed very well in the quarter, further positioning us to meet our financial commitments for the year and providing momentum as we look into 2019. Internal revenue growth in the quarter was 6% for the second time in the last three quarters and is 5% for the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points in the quarter and has expanded in line with expectations at 20 basis points for the first half of the year. Adjusted EPS grew 32% in the second quarter and is up 27% through June 30. Sales was up 6% in the quarter and increased 13% sequentially.","We remain steadfast in our commitment to shareholder value through capital allocation, with a focus on consistent share repurchase. During the second quarter, we crossed the $10 billion threshold in total share repurchases since initiating the program in 2005, including nearly $800 million so far this year. And for those keeping score, we have retired 48% of the shares outstanding over that period at an average cost of just about $22 a share.","As you will recall, we have three key shareholder priorities for 2018, which are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.","We continued our focus on expanding high-quality revenue, recording 6% internal revenue growth in the second quarter. Revenue growth was driven primarily by acceleration in our card, biller, and core account processing businesses, which also included strong license revenue in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points in the quarter and is up 20 basis points for the year to date.","Part of the benefit of an easier adjusted operating margin comparison in the quarter was diluted somewhat, as expected, by our recent acquisitions along with the costs of ramping up new internal revenue. Adjusted EPS was up a stellar 32% in the quarter and 27% for the first half of the year, as a result of higher revenue, lower taxes, and disciplined capital allocation. We are highly confident we will achieve our financial objectives for the year.","Our second priority is to enhance client relationships, with an emphasis on digital and payments solutions. DNA's modern architecture and true real-time processing continues to be a market differentiator. In the quarter, we were pleased to welcome a legacy federal credit union with over $1.4 billion of assets to the Fiserv family. A legacy chose in a competitive process our DNA platform along with a suite of solutions to modernize its infrastructure and to deliver further innovation and quality to their members in a rapidly changing world.","We exited the second quarter with our largest sales pipeline since acquiring DNA in 2013, which has a strong bias to larger institutions. We had 11 clients go live on DNA in the quarter and expect nearly 30 to go live for the year, roughly half which are institutions with assets over $1 billion.","We continue to see sustained growth as consumers adopt more digital services. To that end, Mobiliti ASP subscribers continued to grow, adding 24% more users in the quarter, to now be over 7.5 million.","As digital experiences take hold, interaction models are changing across the growing digital ecosystem. Notifi, our enterprise alerts and events platform, allows financial institutions to leverage digital channels to provide real-time information and access along with transaction security. Like many of our digital solutions, we anticipate this capability to grow and evolve over time, bolstering the relationship between FIs and their customers.","By the end of the year, we should have more than 300 clients in production, which is a roughly sixfold increase for the year. We believe this enabling capability, which increases in value based on the number of integrated solutions a client uses, will grow meaningfully over the next three to five years.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Just a year after its launch last June, Zelle is quickly becoming the go-to solution for sending money. We remain focused on building our footprint through sales, implementations, and transaction growth. Demand for our turnkey Zelle solution remains high, recording 35 sales to financial institutions in the quarter, which represented nearly $100 billion of underlying assets. In addition, we were pleased to expand our relationship with NCR's Digital Insight solution to offer our turnkey Zelle solution to their digital and payments clients.","We had five institutions go live later in the quarter, including Zions Bancorporation, Comerica Bank, Bank of the West, and Navy Federal, the largest credit union in the world. Zelle transactions in the quarter were up more than 40% sequentially, and through June 30 were up more than 15 times the prior year's level. We fully expect growth to accelerate as more clients go live and users adopt this real-time payments service.","Cyber risk and security remain top of mind for institutions of all types and sizes. To further advance this important opportunity, we recently announced an exclusive strategic partnership with the next-generation cybersecurity firm BlueVoyant. We have integrated their capabilities into a unique managed services offering, providing clients with an innovative leading-edge security platform. The market reaction to this comprehensive offering has been very positive, leaving both a strong pipeline and early incremental sales. We are quite bullish on this opportunity.","We also had Blue Shield of California go live on our BillMatrix platform in the quarter, which enables a variety of health payment options across multiple platforms and channels. This launch by one of the largest Blue plans in the nation is a great example of expanding our biller network and adds to the momentum of our integrated biller strategy.","Lastly, we recently announced a long-term agreement with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks to be the naming partner for a new state-of-the-art arena designed to showcase the latest in technology and entertainment experiences. Fiserv Forum, which is an intentional nod to our annual client conference of the same name, provides an unparalleled opportunity to elevate our brand, support our communities, and engage our people. We believe this step further strengthens our leadership position and reinforces the need to consistently deliver on our brand promise in a time of rising expectations. We fully expect this arrangement to deliver incremental value to clients, associates, and you, our shareholders, in an extremely cost-effective fashion.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob for more detail on our financial results.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.","Our adjusted revenue was up 2% to $1.4 billion in the quarter and grew 3% to $2.7 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was excellent at 6% in the quarter and a strong 5% through June 30. As Jeff mentioned, our strong internal revenue growth in the quarter was buoyed in part by license revenue.","As we've previously indicated, we anticipate that periodic revenue will be down on a full-year basis, driven by significant decrease in termination fees in Q4. Overall, the 5% internal revenue growth for the first half of the year is slightly ahead of our internal expectations for accelerated growth this year. As a note, had we restated our results under ASC 606, our year-to-date internal revenue growth rate would have been 70 basis points higher than we reported.","Adjusted operating income for the quarter and year to date grew 4% to $439 million and $883 million respectively. Adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points in the second quarter and is up 20 basis points for the first six months. Normalizing for the impact of acquisitions and dispositions on our results, our adjusted operating margin would have improved by 170 basis points in the quarter and 150 basis points year to date. Consistent with our plans, we also began deploying the incremental investments from tax reform savings in the quarter, with the majority of the spend expected in the second half of the year.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $0.75 for the quarter, and was up 27% to $1.51 for the first half of the year, in each case compared to 2017 results adjusted for the impact of the Lending Solutions transaction. We are very well positioned to extend our streak to 33 consecutive years of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.","The Payments segment's adjusted revenue grew 8% to $771 million in the quarter and 7% to $1.5 billion through June 30. Strong performance across the majority of businesses in the segment, highlighted by card services and biller solutions, drove internal growth of 5% in both the quarter and the first half of 2018.","Transactions and customer usage remain an important element of our business model and future growth. Debit volume growth was in the high single digits. P2P transactions, including Zelle, grew nearly 30%, and Mobiliti ASP users increased 24% in the quarter, all contributing to steady growth trend in our digital and payments solutions.","The Payments segment's adjusted operating income was excellent, increasing 13% to $270 million in the quarter and 9% to $542 million year to date. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 170 basis points to 35% and is up 50 basis points to 35.2% for the first half of the year, as our businesses continued to produce high-quality revenue. Those results are even stronger when considering the headwind from acquisitions that are primarily in this segment.","Moving to the Financial segment, adjusted revenue decreased 5% to $590 million in the quarter and decreased 3% to $1.2 billion for the first six months due to the impact of divestitures on our results. Internal revenue growth was a very strong 7% in the quarter and 4% in the first half of the year. Growth in the quarter was driven by solid performance across much of the segment businesses along with an additional boost from increases in license revenue in the quarter. Although planned for the full year, there was some timing benefit for the license revenue in the quarter, which had been anticipated in Q3.","The Financial segment's adjusted operating income decreased by 6% to $201 million in the second quarter and 2% to $403 million for the first half of 2018, due exclusively to the impact from divestitures. But for those transactions, operating income in both periods would have been up high single digits.","Adjusted operating margin decreased 30 basis points in the quarter to 34%, which includes the Lending transaction's negative impact on adjusted operating margin of 140 basis points. However, year-to-date adjusted operating margin in the segment is up 40 basis points to 33.4%, including the headwinds from the divestiture.","Corporate operating loss was up $3 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% and was 21.2% for the first half of the year, consistent with our outlook. We continue to expect our full-year adjusted tax rate to be between 22% and 23%.","Free cash flow for the first half of the year was down 12% to $491 million, which includes the impact of the Lending Solutions divestiture. Free cash flow conversion through June 30 was lower than anticipated at 78%, primarily due to the timing of both working capital and CapEx spending in the period. These results do not include the approximately $470 million of proceeds from divestitures that closed in the first quarter. We expect to see stronger free cash flow conversion in the second half of the year.","The debt outstanding was up a bit to $4.8 billion as of June 30 and remains at the lower end of our target range at 2.2 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 5.4 million shares for $390 million in the quarter, contributing to the $10 billion of program repurchases Jeff mentioned earlier. Over the first half of the year, we returned $789 million to shareholders, repurchasing 11 million shares. As of quarter's end, we had 406.1 million shares outstanding and 10.4 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.","Now with that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","As I mentioned earlier, sales in the second quarter grew 6% and has increased 9% year to date. Quota attainment was 82% in the quarter and is 87% through June 30. Integrated sales in the quarter was up 11% sequentially to $67 million and is up 9% to $128 million for the first half of the year. Our domestic pipeline increased 20% in the quarter, as institutions are actively considering investments to better serve customers and grow their top line. We continue to expect to achieve our full-year sales targets.","We achieved another $14 million of savings from our operational effectiveness initiative in the quarter and for the first half of the year have booked $32 million of savings. We are on pace to meet our goal of $50 million of savings for the year.","Financial institutions are generally performing well, and we expect that to continue with interest rate increases and continued tax benefits ahead. In addition, a number of institutions have made public attestations of incremental technology investments, with a focus on digital experiences and payments transformation, both of which are near and dear to our heart. We continue to see larger M&A front and center as institutions look to leverage acquired technology investments and gather deposits. We feel very good about the direction of the market and the longer-term benefits these trends hold for our focused and leading solutions.","Overall, let me reiterate that we are in a strong position to achieve our financial goals for the full year. We continue to expect our internal revenue growth rate to increase a minimum of 80 basis points to at least 4.5% for the year. We expect adjusted EPS for the year of $3.02 to $3.15, representing growth of 22% to 27% over the adjusted $2.48 for 2017 and anticipate that our full-year results will be above the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range. We anticipate that full-year adjusted operating margin will expand between 10 and 30 basis points and that free cash flow conversion will be in a range of 106% to 111% for the full year.","In closing, we are pleased with our results for the quarter and are on track to achieve our commitments for the year. And while we understand the importance of financial results in any period, we are equally focused on delivering strategic and operational progress that further positions Fiserv to deliver long-term value for our clients, associates, and you, our shareholders. We know that we are a product of every one of our 24,000 people around the world who contribute daily to our success. It is their unrelenting dedication to our clients that enables us to deliver Fiserv at our best. We are fortunate to have them on our side.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys, great growth and congrats on the Fiserv Forum.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So I guess my first question, the growth was great in the Financial segment, 7%, I think the best in many years. But sequentially, the dollars of revenue was down. Is that the new just the sequential trajectory that's going to be normal now post-Lending? Maybe talk through what was happening there.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes, Dave. That actually is the impact of the Lending divestiture. We had that business through nearly the very ending of the 29th of March when that transaction closed. So you see the revenue materialize in adjusted revenue and then, of course, go away for the second quarter. So you won't see that same sequential dynamic going into future quarters.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you, my mistake. I got you. It was in most of Q1. That makes sense. And then I guess my follow-up Q3-Q4, is it a mirror image of Q1 and Q2? You mentioned the tough comp in Q4. So should that look a little more a like how Q1 was and then Q3 look a little more like Q2?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah, I think the way to think about it, Dave, is we closed out the first half of the year in pretty good shape relative to our full-year guidance. And we expect the second half to look very similar, roughly in line with the first half growth. To your point, given the difficult comp on the term fees in the fourth quarter, you'll see that headwind materialize then.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you, great. Thank you, good job.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, good afternoon and congratulations on the strong acceleration in organic revenue growth.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Just to follow up on the drivers of the 7% internal growth in the Financial segment, which I think was probably the best in more than a decade, if you could just unpack the drivers of that growth, let's say breaking it down between recurring revenue growth, software license growth, and then year-over-year changes in contract term fees.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So let me start and then Bob will add in, David. You know the business well. For us to have that kind of growth in the quarter, we definitely had an increase in periodic revenue, with a bias to license revenue. We had a very strong license quarter. A little bit of that was movement throughout the year that bunched up in the quarter, so it ended up being slightly better. Think we indicated that in our prepared remarks. It was slightly better than we thought it would be in the quarter, not for the full year, but for the quarter.","And I would say that we continue to see success in driving recurring revenue in the segment. You've been tracking our progress with solutions such as DNA. We had 11 go live in the quarter alone, and we expect nearly 30 for the full year. So it is more of a bias to periodic revenue moving the needle to the right, but it continues to complement the level of recurring revenue and sales that we've had in the segment for the last couple of years.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","You called out 11 DNA conversions that went live in the quarter and 30 expected for the full year. How did the balance break down between DNA conversions expected in Q3 and Q4?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I don't have that in front of me, but I'm going to guess that Q4 will actually be meaningfully larger than Q3.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. And then given the strength you've called out in bank IT spending trends, what's the appetite specifically for cross-selling and upselling, and what are the most in-demand solutions for cross-selling and upselling?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So we talked about the fact that our integrated sales are up about 9% year over year, and that's a good proxy for existing clients buying existing add-on solutions. We're seeing a lot of focus on digital, on payments, on risk, cyber, those kinds of products, a lot of interesting movement on authentication. And then we're quite enthusiastic about a newer offering that we have around deposit transformation. As rates go up, we're seeing more and more institutions focus on how are they going to fund assets and being very focused on driving deposit gathering and deposit optimization. So we're seeing that as well, but a good appetite.","And as a reminder, as you know, David, it's a process. People get interested and then they look and then they hopefully buy, and then we eventually implement. So the bullishness this year is part of why we said even at the beginning of the year that we expected to see a step up in 2019, and we continue to feel good about that visibility.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","I appreciate that. Quick final question on Zelle. You called out 40% sequential growth. Can you help dimension for us what the revenue contribution from Zelle might be? And then bigger picture, where is Zelle in its development as a product? Are there more features to be added, for example, social, which is a big component of the main competitive product?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So we would continue to say that transactions, while growing fast, are on a smallish base. Revenue is starting to become measurable but the contributions are not meaningful, if you know what I mean. But the bulk of demand to get into the network is quite high. We indicated there were 35 signings in the quarter alone. And so we see a lot of demand, and you can see in the big banks significant growth in transactions, and we know that will move its way through the rest of the ecosystem.","As far as product development goes, there's a focus on enhancing the consumer experience, and there's also a focus on using Zelle in new and more innovative use cases. And so we're excited to be participating in all of that.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks for that, congratulations.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question. You just touched on this and you talked a little bit about this in your prepared remarks, but the Payments revenue in this quarter, looked like results were better than expected. I just want to ask one on Zelle specifically in a slightly different way. Some of the big banks have been saying they're seeing a significant step up in volume this quarter and last quarter as well. So is the uptick that you're seeing noticeable right now? And along those lines, I'm just wondering if perhaps Zelle-based revenue could contribute more meaningfully in the back half of this year. If you have any color as to the size of impact for us there, that would be very helpful.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So I would reiterate my comment about it being measurable but not meaningful at this stage yet. But we are seeing that aggregate effect, so more institutions going live, more transactions being created, and the network is expanding. One of the reasons why I believe that the larger banks are able to show these very high levels of growth is it has more to do with the closed network utilization that's going on intra-bank where we are a little bit more dependent in terms of getting the real movement to see much more interbank network. And so the more banks in the network, the better that will be. And when I say banks, I really mean banks and credit unions, so financial institutions in general.","So I have a very high degree of confidence that based on the path that we can see right now that the second half of 2018 will be more than the first half of 2018, which was more than the second half of 2017. And the second half of 2018 will be less than the first half of 2019 and the second half of 2019 bigger than that. And so we're going to continue to get this network effect and this growth much like we've seen happen in other transactional businesses, whether that be the card processing businesses or the BillPay business. I think the BillPay business is quite a good proxy for this solution. And given our footprint, we think this will in fact become an important growth driver, and that will for a fairly long period of time based on everything that we can see right now.","Jeffrey Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I appreciate that, and then just a high-level one. You touched on this in your remarks earlier in terms of your own state of the union as far as the health of the banks and credit unions. If we look at FI's results this quarter, it looks like profitability is on the rise and the tenure has been ticking back up towards 3%, which should be positive for bank NIMs overall. The question is how would you frame what banks and credit unions are open to spending more on? You talked about cyber et cetera. I just wanted to get your thoughts there. It would help us think through the back half of this year, and then what type of trajectory you might have heading into 2019 as well.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So, Jeff, I would say there are a few different categories. The first category \u2013 and I should say that these apply equally to both retail and commercial\/business customers, so everything around digital experience. So the branch in your pocket or your personal payments device, being able to transact more fully and holistically in a safe and secure way on a device, I would say that's number one.","Number two is really around deposit gathering, everything that can be done to create more funding for assets given the ticking up of the tenure and the cost of money. So we're hearing more and more about banks really of all sizes looking at setting up separate deposit gathering vehicles and different ways to expand their reach.","And then third, it's really around putting the money to work, so different ways to think about lending, different ways to think about origination and servicing. We're seeing a fair amount of discussion, especially on the upper end of the asset size base, around RPA, automation, cognitive, whatever you want to say, but basically where data starts to meet robots and how can we use that to create more customized experiences, more efficiency, those kinds of things. And then you always have the risk wrappers and everything else. But the investments tend to be more of the former of that conversation.","Jeffrey Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And, Jeff, I'm going to be looking for you on TV when Giannis and the Bucks play at Fiserv Forum, okay?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I appreciate you taking the question.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Jeff, is it safe to say that as your pipeline grows that the composition looks pretty similar to the growth drivers we saw in this quarter, or are you starting to see a skew perhaps more toward Mobiliti and software? I'm just wondering if there's a tipping point at which some of these newer solutions start to inform the growth as opposed to say a single point solution like Zelle or something like that, sort of an aggregate view.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Andrew, I would say when you bifurcate it via growth drivers and pipeline, we're actually seeing more larger transactions building our pipeline as opposed to smaller \u2013 we've got plenty of smaller deals. But those kinds of solutions, whether they be Mobiliti or Architect or other, those tend to be transactions \u2013 I'm sorry, those tend to be solutions that are based on transactions. And so we tend to sell those in, but the revenue will mature over time.","And so a lot of the growth that we're seeing coming in right now has to do with sales that were well in the past. I think one of the things we talked about is Mobiliti subscribers being up 24%. If you go back and look at the last three years, I think the plus 20% is where it's been, and that compounds quite quickly when you've got 12 or 16 quarters that are running at that kind of pace.","Our pipeline, on the other hand, has larger, more complex kinds of projects that will actually convert to revenue faster than some of these transaction building solutions that we're seeing benefit from right now. So I feel actually pretty good as we think about 2019 and 2020, assuming our pipeline matures the way we expect it to, that that will drive different layers of recurring revenue that is complementary to what we're seeing driving our results currently.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And with regard to BillPay, it's good to hear that as a call-out growth driver. Do you feel like BillPay is having a little bit of a renaissance? I know the consolidator model that I guess a lot of folks thought would prevail when you acquired CheckFree has perhaps given way a little bit to Biller Direct over the years. Do you see new use cases that can breathe perhaps new life into that BillPay business of yours longer term?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","We do, Andrew. We're quite bullish. We've been spending the last three years working on how to create a more powerful linkage between the experiences at Biller Direct and what we can do in the consolidator model. So that's one thing on the experience side. And we're seeing more interest from the larger institutions on taking this capability because of the importance of the digital experience. So that we feel quite good about it if you think about it from a distribution standpoint.","I do think that one of the ancillary benefits of something like Zelle is the more consumers do within the mobile experience, the more predisposed they'll be to do things like use consolidated BillPay as long as they're in doing that. And Zelle \u2013 the Zelle energy will create more electronically originated payments out of the bank channels than frankly we've seen for a long time because, for the most part, with the exception of a little of account-to-account transfer, BillPay has been the only real killer app that's out there. If all of a sudden Zelle is a killer app, I think they will complement each other and drive growth on both sides.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, guys, nice results,","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Let me just start off. Starting off, you mentioned, Jeff, the 300 clients by the end of the year using digital offerings. I guess I just wanted to get a little more color on whether these are \u2013 how many of these are the existing clients that are adding \u2013 either they're taking on more of your services versus potentially new clients? And I guess to me, it seems like that's clearly where the technology environment is trending towards across all IT services, with banks being no exception. I just wonder how big of an opportunity this could be. How big are these clients? How much can they actually spend on these initiatives around digital that you referenced earlier first?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So for clarity, the 300 or so clients that we would have live in production by the end of the year, we were referring to our Notifi platform, which is a technology that allows events, two-way alerts, actionable alerts, digital interaction between financial institutions and their customers. That is alongside of the probably 3,000 or so clients that we have today that are using some of our digital platforms.","The beauty of Notifi is the more solutions that are Fiserv solutions, the higher the quality of the alerts and events that we can communicate out. And so not only are we wrapping a service around the data, the transactional data on a customer-by-customer basis, but that data is exponentially more valuable if you're using a debit platform and a mobile platform and a risk platform and a bill pay platform and everything else. So you've got the different pools of data being reviewed for information that's important to the customer.","So that platform we think will eventually be across the entire mobile base because it will be the way consumers expect to be dealt with. And so over time, that will continue to add on. I would also say that virtually every new core account processing deal we sell has Notifi in the package.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","All right, that's helpful. I guess at the end of the day, when you couple that with the new DNA platforms you're signing on, I guess the bigger question probably ought to be how much of a capture you have from core to all the other ancillary technology offerings that you now offer on the payments side as well. And I guess how much have you ever disclosed how much cross-sell you've actually accomplished on your existing clients yet?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","It's a number that's in the billions in terms of annual revenue. But what I would say is, if you look at the attach rates, they've more than doubled on average over the last 10 or so years that we've been doing this. But if you look at a new client, they tend to be in the 20 to 30 incremental products on top of each account processing technology. And that is \u2013 sorry, solution. And that is the basis of the integrated biller strategy that we introduced at our last Investor Day, taking that exact same model, and we're starting to see that strategy pay dividends, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Bob, just a really quick follow-up, I may not have heard it, but did you meant quantify the license revenue benefit that helped the quarter out?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","I actually did not. For the quarter, it was mid-teens, which gets us year to date high single digits, $6 million \u2013 $7 million benefit year over year. That is periodic revenue in total.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Great, all right. Very helpful, guys, thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","Our next question will be coming from Matt O'Neill from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Matthew O'Neill - Autonomous Research","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Most of them have been answered around Zelle and some of the product initiatives. I was just wondering from a housekeeping perspective if there's any seasonality to the Lending business. I'm just trying to figure out if the base year adjustment was I guess $71 million versus $64 million in Q1. It seems like maybe $10 million shifted from the Lending business into the corporate line. If you could just help with the confusion there.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes, we did see some growth. There is a bit of seasonality. The second half would typically be a little larger. But of course, that's out of our numbers now going forward because that transaction closed right at the end of first quarter.","Matthew O'Neill - Autonomous Research","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Brett Huff of Stephens, Incorporated. Your line is now open.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","One is a housekeeping question. I think you mentioned this. The ASC 606, can you give us the ASC 606 impact again? It would have been a little bit better, I believe.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","For the first six months of the year, it would have been about 70 basis points higher.","Paul Seamon - Fiserv, Inc.","Right.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And did you disclose that for the quarter? I just want to make sure I didn't miss it.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","No, we didn't. We did disclose second quarter. Order of magnitude it's about \u2013 excuse me, we disclosed it in the first quarter. Order of magnitude is about the same.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, thank you for that, and then just a bigger picture question. Given all the money that it sounds like the big banks are starting to spend or at least saying they're starting to spend and use up some of their tax benefit, the numbers are really large, billions and billions of dollars. Have you seen a reaction in the folks that you focus on in your smaller and medium-sized banks to what is effectively a big offensive push on the digital front typically? So what is the reaction? And then what is the thing that they're asking for, particularly in response to that if that's a reaction?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So, Brett, I would say \u2013 I would answer your question two ways. First of all, we are fortunate enough to not only serve the small and medium banks, but we also serve a number of the larger banks, as you know. And so we're actually in some of those conversations as well.","I would say as you start to move through the ecosystem, it's the things that we've been talking about, digital payments, cyber security, deposit gathering. There are some conversations around loan origination, some conversations around wealth management. But I think the real \u2013 what they need and want from us is to help them be prepared digitally to compete with the larger institutions that are spending obviously very significant dollars and setting a high bar. And so they're looking for us to make sure that we're keeping up with the proverbial Joneses.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful, and then last question for me. When you do the integrated payments system that you talked about last Investor Day and you think about incorporating Zelle and a new enhanced BillPay and things like that, are there any of your bank customers that have taken that product on? And do we have enough data to see what the consumer behavior really is around that? Are they choosing Zelle over BillPay for certain transactions? Is there any insight there for us? Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure, Brett. It's a little early. I would say we have a couple of clients that are out there right now, and so we're learning. Demand is quite high. So we're moderating that right now as we learn and develop. But we're going to be very pleasantly pleased with the results once it's out there.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks, good afternoon, good quarter. Just on the licensed product side, I was curious, anything specific that was in high demand in the second quarter? I guess that commentary is a little counter to what FIS says. I was just trying to reconcile maybe what's in demand and what's not.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Tien-Tsin, I would say it's across two or three different parameters. You've got risk products that you see movement in, see account processing where we're seeing movement in and in some of the cash and deposit areas, I would say. On top of the normal, we have many, many products that fit into the license category, the smaller licenses that get bundled up. And for us, I don't think we're dealing with some of the things that you may have heard this morning. And so I think it's less a sales environment than it is the implications of some of the changes that went in earlier this year.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Understood, that's helpful. And then just maybe on the margin front, I wanted to ask if your view has changed at all in terms of where you might fall on the margin spectrum of 10% to 30% versus, say, 90 days ago; any change there?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I think the simple answer is no.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, okay. Thought I'd ask anyway. Then quick last one, just on the, Jeff, I wanted to ask you, just the whole \u2013 I'll bundle them together. This direct challenger, digital bank movement, if you will, are you seeing more activity from this group in terms of trying to go after the market? Are they starting to fill up into your pipeline, and does Fiserv have a strategy specifically to go after that market?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So I would say that there's more conversations going on right now and exploration. We do have a solution that we have created that we think is actually quite strong for the market using DNA and several of our other solutions to create a digitally advantaged product set. But I think it's too early to know how it's going to turn out except to say that there's a real focus in the end market on deposit gathering.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks for your insight.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering. Within digital, does your comp set or your competition change at all when you go after those dollars? And what edge do you feel your company brings?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure, Joe. So I would say that the digital space is probably one of the most competitive segments of the market because you are dealing with a number of competitors that can range from a quasi-startup all the way up to some of the biggest providers in the world, technology providers in the world providing digital solutions. So it is a more competitive space.","I think where we are advantaged is we've been a leader in digital banking for going on 20 years. And we have a significant understanding of the market. We have new and modern technologies, and we have some of the best experts in the field. So from our perspective, we feel quite good about our ability to compete in that space, and I think our advantages show up in our win rates, which are pretty attractive.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And then can we get an update on the overall cost take-out program? I just wanted to see where we stood and maybe thoughts about renewals in the future, et cetera.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So I think, and Bob will correct me when I'm wrong on this. I think we're roughly $32 million or so...","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","That's correct through the first half.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","...for the first half of the year. And I think Bob had mentioned in a previous setting that we would be renewing our program at the end of the five years.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","So we're right now actually exactly halfway through the five-year program, two and half years now in. We are better than halfway through our five-year goal of $250 million. And we've indicated a few times, whether it was Investor Day or other forums like this type of a call, where we fully expect that we'll complete what is now Phase 3 that we're in the midst of in another couple years and then launch Phase 4 and perhaps someday Phase 5. So we feel good about the results year to date and program to date. We feel good about the opportunity into the future to continue.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it, and last one for me on the capital allocation side. I imagine you're looking for assets within digital. What's particularly attractive to you in that particular arena? Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. When you talk about capital allocation, our minds quickly go to share repurchase because it's our benchmark. I would say when we think about acquisitions as part of our capital allocation strategy, we do bias to areas, payments, digital, especially in the commercial side. I think that's an area of which we continue to have an interest. But the payments ecosystem on balance is we think very important and will become more important over the next several years as the plumbing starts to change. And so we're focused in those areas.","And then I would say the other area that is of interest is just around data, the importance of data into the future. I don't think anyone can underestimate how critical that will be when you think about new decision models that financial institutions will embrace over the next three, five, seven, 10 years.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I was wondering if you could maybe renew your thoughts on the prospects for bank M&A in the sweet spot of your customer set in terms of bank size. It seems like on the larger side at least, there has been a little bit more activity. So can you maybe share with us your thoughts on directionally where those transactions might go up, down, or sideways? And then more specifically on ones that have actually been announced, what your conversations have been like so far in terms of their willingness to keep on your platform versus go with something else?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So I would say, exactly to your point, there have been some larger transactions that have been announced this year. And I think that is indicative of larger institutions \u2013 really all institutions feeling a bit emboldened by the combination of rising interest rates and lower taxes, and also understanding that as institutions get larger, they have a need to put more money into technologies and creating cost leverage. So we're seeing the same kinds of things that you're seeing, and we expect that to continue for a bit.","In the lower \u2013 in the smaller space, there's much more of a concern about valuation levels, and so we're not seeing as much activity as we anticipated. In fact, we've been saying all year we actually expect our termination fee revenue to be meaningfully down. And that's really a product of what we're seeing on the acquisition front \u2013 or on the merger and acquisition front. So from that perspective, we are seeing that.","And then the last piece is typically the acquiring bank is always going to have a leg up because it's their technology. And every once in a while, you find an opportunity to win one where your client wasn't the acquirer. But that is much more the exception than the norm. And I would say that for us, for the last 30 years we've been dealing with about the same 4% to 5% shrinkage in the number of buying units, and I suspect that will continue for the next foreseeable future. So it's just part of what we have to deal with on a regular basis.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Helpful color, thank you. And then maybe to follow up, I know there were a lot of questions asked on Zelle, but I just wanted to ask in terms of the implementations. I think you've talked about 35 Zelle sales this quarter. I think you talked about 10 prior to this, so I'm not sure if 45 is the correct math or not. But can you maybe talk about over what timeframe you plan to bring those online because we've heard some data points which suggest there have been some delays in actually physically getting a lot of the new FIs onto the network?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Jim, I think we're on the record of being one of the people who have talked about the fact that there are delays. The only real constraint we have at this point is being able to log them in as members on the network. Now of course, it's much more difficult than that. I think so far, we've communicated around 70 or so sales of Zelle, and we're at about 10 live, so we're pretty early in our process. I think the sales will continue to increase. And then we're working quite closely with EWS, who is the management of Zelle, to increase capacity, and we're optimistic that that's going to happen over the next several quarters, which we think will be fantastic for the industry.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Jeff and Bob.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Ashwin.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. So I wanted to ask about digital transformation, obviously a big driver in terms of the nature of demand changing. But as you put in more and more of your digital solutions, the question really is can you also affect your cost of delivery or changes to your sales organization? And can you flatten the cost curve, so to speak, because of data delivery, and any way to size the impact over multiple years, any help you can give there?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, Ashwin, you were breaking up a little bit in there. But I would say that we've done I think a pretty reasonable job at flattening our cost curves in any number of ways over the last dozen or so years. I think we've taken out somewhere in the area of $700 million of costs or in that area, and we're continuing to look at more ways to do that.","As clients take on more and more solutions, there is a need to be able to increase the throughput for them because clients are going to need to move we think faster. And so we're looking at automation, whether it be robotics or other ways to automate more, so that clients can go live faster and pull in more content into their systems to meet the changing demands of the market. So we are working on those fronts, which we think will create some efficiency for us that frankly allow the pipes to get larger and larger.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it, and then a question on the free cash flow conversion. It normally flows through as you go through the year. The year-to-date free cash flow conversion percent seems a bit on the low side, and I wanted to ask about the puts and takes as well as whether by the time the year is done you'd be closer to 100%.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes, Ashwin, we indicated it actually in the prepared remarks up front that the 78% conversion rate we've seen through the first half is lighter than we would have expected. There are really three things to point to. Number one, ASC 606 doesn't impact cash dollars but does impact cash ratio or conversion rate. And that would have been about 83% to 84% had we not had the ASC 606 impact. But more directly, again, as we mentioned in the opening comments, we see some impacts of timing of working capital as well as CapEx that at this point we expect to reverse in the second half of the year. And we see a second half conversion much stronger than we had in the first half of the year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Ashwin, one of the things that we talked about is you can only be in 105% to 110% cash flow conversion for so many years. And then sometimes there's a little bit of a breather, and you never know when that breather is going to be. We believe we'll end up above 100%, but that does happen every once in a while. And it's just about building of working capital and the convergence or the conspiracy with CapEx and all that. But we're quite comfortable that the model remains to be strong and above earnings on a regular basis.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And if I could squeeze one more in, regulatory change has always been a friend. I want to ask if the easing of complexity, particularly small and midsized banks, whether it's helping. And just looking out a couple of years whether CECL [Current Expected Credit Loss] is likely to be meaningful for you guys, any specificity around that?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure, so I would say that the regulatory relief in the smaller parts of the market has been quite welcomed as well as on the upper ends of the market. And so that's created some continuing momentum as people think about where to invest and is lowering the investment threshold in those kinds of products, so that's quite positive. And so overall, that's just another momentum builder.","I would say that as it relates to CECL, we do feel quite good about that. Now the smaller banks really have until late 2019, early 2020 to be using the technology. But I would guess that we'll measure the number of clients in the thousands for that as opposed to in the handfuls just because of the need and because of the proximity to the core account processing systems.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Thanks for the support and have a great evening.","Operator","Thank you very much.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question and answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.","Stephanie Gregor - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of Fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results, highlighted by the sequential acceleration of our internal revenue growth rate to 5%, excellent adjusted margin expansion, and a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share. These results were consistent with the ramp we expected this year and are indicative of the financial performance and continuing internal revenue growth acceleration we previewed at our June Investor Day.","Adjusted earnings per share is up 15% for the first nine months of the year, due to strong adjusted operating income growth and disciplined capital allocation. As a result, we have raised our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $3.84 to $3.87, an increase of 14% to 15% over last year.","Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, and in the face of equity market volatility in the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares. We remain very committed to that strategy, and through September 30 had already returned over $1 billion to shareholders. Sales in the quarter was up sequentially over Q2 and came in at 86% of quota. This is a solid result in light of a tough prior-year comparison and heightened expectations for increased performance. We're set up for a very strong finish to the year.","Now let me provide an update on our 2015 enterprise priorities, which are, first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments. Next, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. And, third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients.","Our first priority centers on building high-quality revenue in areas that support client value, margin expansion, and earnings growth. Third quarter internal revenue growth accelerated 5%, with strong performance across both segments. Businesses with high recurring revenues such as account processing, payments including card services, lending, and biller solutions all performed well. For reference, our reported results include a negative currency impact of 70 basis points in the quarter and was 60 basis points year-to-date.","Growing revenues in areas where we have operating leverage along with flexing our operational efficiency muscle led to a 190 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin in the quarter, and was up 150 basis points for the year. We believe our business model will produce continued operating margin expansion into the foreseeable future. We're pleased with our financial performance and are on track to meet our shareholder commitments.","Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships, with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. One of our key strategies is to partner with financial institutions to drive higher levels of digital engagement for our clients. We continued to gain momentum with our industry-leading mobile solutions in the quarter. With over 2,000 financial institution clients now live on Mobiliti ASP, we have seen a more than 50% increase in subscribers to nearly 4 million users as of September 30.","We expanded our overall mobile footprint in the quarter, adding 100 new clients to the family. We were pleased that First Hawaiian Bank, with $18.7 billion in assets, selected a full suite of digital banking, payments, and personal financial management capabilities from Fiserv, including Corillian Online, Mobiliti ASP, CheckFree RXP, and Popmoney. These solutions will provide best-of-breed digital engagement to their customers and a lower total cost of ownership.","At our Investor Day, we also discussed opportunities to utilize payment speed and efficiency to create solutions that deliver unique value for consumers, financial institutions, and billers. During the quarter, PNC, the eighth-largest bank in the U.S., selected Popmoney for disbursements to do just that.","This solution utilizes our Popmoney capabilities to simplify and expedite the business-to-consumer payment experience. In a test of payment receipt options, nearly 50% of consumers opted to receive funds via Popmoney. This use case is an important part of our integrated payment strategy and is one of the distinctive growth opportunities embedded in our DDA-based payment approach.","Seven DNA clients went live in the quarter and we remain on track for 30 installs this year. Importantly, we anticipate that six institutions with assets greater than $1 billion will go live in the fourth quarter, including Columbia Bank, with $4.6 billion of assets, and the $14.4 billion asset institution, Washington Federal, all contributing to increased growth in Q4 and well beyond. We continue to be very pleased with DNA's momentum.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients. One of our primary areas of innovation are solutions that create revenue for our clients. We recently highlighted our new CardValet product at our fall client Forum. This solution enables debit cardholders to take control over their spending patterns through the comfort of their mobile device. The early indications are extremely positive, with CardValet users adding an average of five incremental debit transactions per month.","On top of deeper customer engagement, financial institutions should also benefit from additional interchange revenue. Although early, over 200 clients have already signed up for CardValet. When live, this group of FIs will further empower their more than 4.5 million underlying debit cardholders, which should translate to new revenue over the short and mid-term.","We're also excited about our Immediate Funds solution, which provides financial institutions tools to allow consumers real-time access to deposited funds across branch, ATM and mobile channels. This is another example of a Fiserv solution which creates value for consumers and new revenue for our clients.","EMV continued to progress in the quarter, with an additional boost from the October 1 liability shift date. As you know, Fiserv both manufactures and personalizes EMV cards, giving us a competitive advantage along with multiple sources of revenue. Although demand has picked up, we only recognized about 10%, or $1 million, of the incremental EMV revenue generated in the quarter. The remaining $9 million will be deferred until the manufactured cards are personalized. We expect to see incremental revenue growth from EMV in the fourth quarter and well into 2016.","Lastly, we were very pleased to sign our first Agiliti client, Think Money Limited, in October. Think Money, which has been in existence for more than 20 years, provides a broad range of innovative financial products for personal financial management, mortgage and insurance services across more than 100,000 personal accounts today. The Agiliti pipeline remains strong and we expect additional signings before the end of the year.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thanks, Jeff. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our performance in the quarter. Internal revenue growth accelerated sequentially to 5%. These results included a 140 basis point negative impact due to a combination of unfavorable currency impacts and the EMV revenue deferral that Jeff mentioned earlier.","Adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 20% over the prior year, to $1.03. Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $3.7 billion in the first nine months of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% year-to-date. Our continued focus on recurring revenue acceleration was highlighted by a 6% increase in processing and services revenue this quarter offset by a decline in product revenue due primarily to lower card reissuance revenue in Output Solutions.","Combined license and termination fee revenue benefited revenue growth by 60 basis points in the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date. Adjusted operating income growth was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date to $411 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Adjusted operating margin was up 190 basis points in the quarter to 33.1% and year-to-date was up 150 basis points to 32%. Margin performance across both segments was primarily driven by revenue growth in our scale processing businesses and cost efficiencies, including savings from our operational effectiveness program.","Now on to the segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payment segment was 6% in the quarter versus our strongest prior-year quarter and up 5% year-to-date. Growth in our card services and Biller businesses led the segment performance.","While EMV production in our Output Solutions business increased, much of that revenue, $9 million, was deferred to future periods due to cards which have been fully manufactured as of quarter-end but not yet personalized.","We have added nearly 100 new debit clients through September and have a solid pipeline of future activity. Our double-digit transaction growth so far this year remains ahead of the market. Our integrated debit value proposition along with continued solution innovation, such as CardValet and CardFree Cash, is resonating well with the market.","Bill payment transaction growth remained in the low-single digits and we saw good traction in value-added services, such as same-day bill payment, which has transaction growth of 36% over last year. Mobile users continue to grow, as we approach 4 million Mobiliti ASP subscribers at the end of the quarter. We continue to believe digital transformation is still early in the cycle and expect to see even more growth in the future as demand for digital services continues.","Payment segment adjusted operating income grew 8% in the quarter to $217 million, and year-to-date is up 9% to $616 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points in the quarter to 33.7%, and through September is up 110 basis points to 32.7%, driven primarily by growth in our scale recurring revenue businesses and cost efficiencies.","Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by strength in our account processing and lending businesses along with the positive impact of higher combined termination and license revenue partially offset by currency.","Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 13% in the quarter to $218 million and up 9% to $631 million in the first nine months of the year. Adjusted operating margin was 35.5% in the quarter and has increased 180 basis points to 34.8% year to date. Strong margin performance in the quarter was driven by scale business growth in areas such as account processing and lending, higher one-time fees, and benefits from our continued focus on operational efficiency.","Corporate segment adjusted net operating performance for the quarter and year to date are both in line with our expectations and consistent with the comparable prior-year results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter, and year to date is up 100 basis points to 34.7%, resulting in a $0.04 per share negative impact year over year. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximate 36%.","Free cash flow was $666 million through September 30. Results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the timing of working capital, including a $60 million increase in tax payments compared to 2014. Our free cash flow does not include a $32 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver venture in the quarter. We anticipate stronger fourth quarter results due to working capital favorability, including lower tax payments. Free cash flow per share is up 5% year to date to $2.77. Total debt at September 30 was $4.2 billion, or 2.3 times our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.","We are deeply committed to creating value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation. We repurchased $514 million of our stock in the quarter, nearly equaling the amount in the first half of the year. For the first three quarters of the year, we have allocated over $1 billion to share repurchase, acquiring 12.9 million shares at an average price of $81 per share. As of quarter's end, there were 229.5 million shares outstanding and 6.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom. As I mentioned up front, sales in the quarter were 86% of quota. Actual sales performance was down a bit compared to the prior year's results, primarily from deals pushing to future quarters. Pipelines are solid across the board, including good traction with our newer solutions. We expect to finish our sales year strong, leading to excellent momentum going into 2016.","Integrated sales in the quarter were $57 million, led by solutions such as debit and credit services, mobility, bill payment, source capture, and statement processing. With integrated sales of $168 million through September, we expect to meet our $250 million target for the year.","Operational effectiveness savings were up sequentially in the quarter and now at $44 million year to date. In addition to solid in-year performance, we are building the foundation to achieve the new $250 million target we shared at Investor Day.","We were pleased to complete the construction of our Alpharetta campus in the quarter. 80% of our nearly 2,000 Atlanta-based associates from a number of locations are now housed in our new state-of-the-art facility. In conjunction with this project, we also consolidated two of our largest data centers, which we also expect will generate meaningful savings.","Although the financial institution environment remains generally stable, the conjecture and implications around interest rates were front and center in the quarter. M&A activity is progressing at elevated levels, which we expect will continue. While regulatory inefficiency remain in focus, we are starting to see early movement by financial institutions towards revenue-focus solutions that deliver end-user value at the intersection of real-time, digital, and evolving consumer expectations.","As I mentioned up front, we are well positioned to achieve our 2015 financial objectives, which include our third consecutive year of increased internal revenue growth. We are tightening our internal revenue growth guidance to 5% for the full year, which would translate to approximately 6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That performance would cap off a strong second half of the year and serve as an attractive exit run rate for 2016.","We have raised our full-year adjusted earnings per share target to a range of $3.84 to $3.87, which at 14% to 15% growth is above the top end of our previous guidance of $3.73 to $3.83. We also expect that adjusted operating margin will increase well over 50 basis points for the full year, and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year.","Although we are in sight of delivering our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, we are far more excited about the future. We are providing a unique set of solutions that enable our clients to best serve their customers, which should drive high-quality revenue growth for Fiserv into the future. We know our success is dependent on the more than 21,000 talented associates who partner with our thousands of clients around the world. We are grateful for the difference they make each and every day.","Speaking of talented associates, earlier today we filed an 8-K announcing that after more than 20 years at Fiserv, the last 10 of them as CFO, Tom Hirsch intends to retire on March 31, 2016. Tom is leaving for personal reasons and does not have plans to pursue comparable employment outside of Fiserv. He will also be available as needed after March for special projects and to ensure a smooth transition. Tom is a stellar executive with deep business acumen and tremendous passion for the company and its clients. He has been instrumental in the transformation of Fiserv, working with the team to deliver strong results and set an even more attractive course for the future.","On a personal note, Tom has been a great partner, confidante and friend. In typical form, he will be more than fully engaged until he walks out the door. And when he closes the ledger for the last time, he will be missed. With that said, transition and change breed opportunity. Tom and his family will embark on a new chapter of their life, and so will the company. We intend to consider a full slate of internal and external candidates for this highly desirable role. We have a strong finance leadership team, which we believe will ensure a smooth transition. And we expect to make a decision on a new CFO no later than January 31.","With that, Cindy, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. And our first question's coming from Mr. Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer Company. Sir, your line is open.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good afternoon, all of you. And, Tom, sorry to see that you're leaving.","Thomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thanks, Glenn.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. I guess the first question would be maybe, Jeff, if you could give us a little bit more in terms of the environment and the sales outlook. It sounds like the sales was okay in the quarter, not great. Maybe a few deals were pushed out. Maybe just more about the \u2013 just from a bigger-picture perspective, the sales environment, not only into the fourth quarter, but heading into 2016. And then I got a follow-up.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Glenn. And I would say that while sales were a little bit lower than obviously 100% in the quarter, we've had two really great years in a row, kind of two record years. And I think to some extent we are focused on transitioning from a lot of the things that we've sold historically. We had a big burst of energy right as we brought DNA in. We're in the midst of bringing those live.","And we're getting some very strong traction with some of the newer solutions that I talked about today, whether it be Popmoney for disbursements or immediate funds, CardValet, a number of different products. So while the first few quarters have been a little bit light, we expect quite a strong fourth quarter. We typically have had larger deals in the middle of the year. This year those deals have been a bit bifurcated. We had a little bit early. We expect to see several of them late. And we feel very good about our pipeline and the momentum going into next year across \u2013 really across the entire company.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then could you just remind us where you are in the conversion pipeline, both for DNA and the account processing pipeline? Sounds like you're going to complete 30 of the DNAs this year. What's the balance going into 2016? And then just an update on the account processing pipeline too, conversion pipeline.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Absolutely. I would say still the majority of our larger deals have not yet been converted in this year. I mentioned that we've got six $1 billion-plus institutions going live on DNA alone in the fourth quarter. We haven't given any visibility yet into what next year's conversion cycle looks like. We'll give a little bit more visibility into that when we get into February, when we give guidance next year. But we're making good progress.","Our biggest clients \u2013 I mentioned Washington Federal, which is our largest DNA conversion. That'll go live in the fourth quarter. So much of that revenue will start to show up in Q4, and then turn into next year. And across the rest of our platforms, most of our larger conversions are going into next year, so we will not have benefited from them in 2014 \u2013 2015. I'm sorry.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So you still have the comfort and the visibility to think that organic growth will further accelerate in 2016?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely. We stand very clearly by our conversation at Investor Day. We're going to see \u2013 we're going to exit the year, as we said, at approximately 6%. And we expect to have that be a good foundation for our growth going into next year.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Great. Thank you.","\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question's coming from Mr. Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nSure.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs\nI was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the margins and the sustainability of them. Obviously some good upside and I guess some one-time items in the quarter. But can you maybe talk about what really drove that upside? Was that purely the incremental margin contribution from the payment site business, or were there also some ongoing benefits from data center consolidation that were in there in the quarter?\n\nSo you can see on the cost dynamic that our overall costs have increased this year-to-date about 2% only. And, again, we have a lot of factors that contribute to that. High-quality revenue, we have a scalable model, and our operational effectiveness including, as Jeff talked about, some of our data center consolidations, which are actually going to have a greater impact as we look out over the next several years. So we continue to be confident and continuing margin expansion over the next several years as we kind of go into our next phase of operational effectiveness.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs\nThat's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe one for Jeff, just to follow up on the sales question. Can you maybe talk about the types of deals that pushed out into Q4 or into 2016? Were those mainly on the core processing or DNA side? Or were there more ancillary things like bill pay and Popmoney?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, the deals that you manage from a slippage perspective tend to be the larger, broad solution multiple-solution deals. So they did bias to the account processing, the core processing side. We had a couple of other deals slip on the lending side, but it's really on the account processing pieces of the business.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs\nOkay. Thank you.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah.\n\nOperator\nThank you. Next question is coming from Mr. David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut - Evercore ISI\nThank you. Good afternoon.\n\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nHey, David.\nDavid Togut - Evercore ISI\nI'm not sure whether or not to congratulate you, Tom. But you'll certainly be missed.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nOkay. Thanks, David. I appreciate that.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nDavid, we're going go for congratulations.\nDavid Togut - Evercore ISI\nOkay. Well, definitely a bittersweet moment.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nYes.\nDavid Togut - Evercore ISI\nQuestion on DNA. I know with sort of the previous generation product, Acumen, one of the big challenges you faced was much-longer-than-expected conversion timeline. What are you finding on these big DNA wins in terms of timeline to convert versus your expectation?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nNo, that's a very good question, David. We are actually very, very happy with the implementation work that's happened with DNA, especially given that this was new to the family just in early 2013. And we have meaningfully ramped up their implementations. I would guess that we'll do more implementations in the fourth quarter than that business did in the prior 12 to 18 months. So we have ramped it up nicely.\nAnd we are finding to the extent that there are any issues, and there have been very few, but if there are any issues, they are not coming from us. They're coming on the client side. And these have also tended to be larger, multiple-product implementations. Again, so they've got a level of complexity, and the team has dealt with them beautifully. Most of the clients are referenceable, if not on day one, on day three or four. So we're feeling very good about the implementations to date. And that's one of the reasons why we have great momentum in the market.\nDavid Togut - Evercore ISI\nGreat. And then do you have any data on attach rates? You've highlighted your surround strategy with DNA. Any data on attach rates for products like payments and so forth?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nI would say that we're seeing at or better than what we've seen across the enterprise. If you remember, when we acquired Open Solutions, one of our strategic hypotheses was that because Open didn't have the value of the surround set, that there was something that had been missing from that value proposition.\nAnd as we brought it in, as we shared at Investor Day, we've been very happy with the level of both sales within the new DNA wins since we've acquired it, but even more important have been the ability to penetrate the existing base. So we're not going to give that data right now, but I would say we remain as optimistic and with the same level of conviction as when we talked in June and when we talked prior to that.\nDavid Togut - Evercore ISI\nYour cost savings appear to be running ahead of plan. As we see these big implementations of DNA, should we expect the operating leverage of the business to improve even further?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nSo I would separate the cost savings from the point of operating leverage. Primarily when we're talking about operating leverage, we'd be talking about the ability to add new revenue to our scaled businesses at a pretty low incremental cost, a very high incremental margin.\nAnd at the same time, at some point we will likely be able to reduce the size of our implementation team within DNA, but frankly that's the last thing we want to do. I'd like nothing better than to be building that implementation team out even further, because we're winning lots of deals there. The majority of this next phase of $250 million of operational effectiveness saves is going to come from looking to become more efficient in our real-estate footprint, looking to bring together some of our disbursed data centers and also looking for ways to get better leverage out of our disbursed workforce. So those are the big three ways that we see that we're going to knock down that $250 million.\nRemember also in our operational effectiveness savings, they're going to be a little lumpy by quarter. And so we had a very good quarter this year. I think we're just about $5 million, $6 million away from our target for the year. Hopefully we'll stay ahead of that as we can, but we continue to build that muscle and we feel good about our ability for the next few years to use that to create supplemental margin moving forward.\nDavid Togut - Evercore ISI\nGot it. Just two quick housekeeping questions. Can you give the debit volume growth in the third quarter? And then if you could call out the termination fees standalone outside of the software license fees and what the year-over-year compare is?\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nYeah, David, I don't have that in front of me. But the year-to-date is around 10%. I think in the third quarter, it's somewhere in the high-single digits...\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nFor debit.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nFor debit, exactly. And roughly around 10%, I believe, on a year-to-date basis. Again, good growth in that particular area.\nRegarding the termination fees, I know, David, as you well know, it's kind of a normal part of our business and they vary period to period. The combined license and termination fees were up about $6 million to $7 million in the third quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year.\nTo your question specifically, termination fees overall were up by approximately $10 million year-to-date and for the quarter. This was offset, however, by a decrease of about $5 million in license fees year-to-date and for the quarter.\nAnd just as a reminder, we had negative currency impact in the quarter of about $8 million and $20 million on a year-to-date basis, which more than offset those increases. And as Jeff highlighted, we had to defer about $9 million of EMV revenue in the quarter due to the fact that we've completed the manufacturing element but have not personalized the cards, which is a smaller part of that, which will happen. And so with that, that's the numbers on the termination fee side.\nDavid Togut - Evercore ISI\nThank you very much.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Dave Koning at Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)\nYeah. Hey, guys. And congrats, Tom. A ton of good quarters in the last 10 years for sure. And I guess my first question, the EBIT growth on an organic basis, you could say it was about the strongest it's been in probably the last eight years or so, maybe even longer. And so I know you isolated high-quality revenue and some cost initiatives and stuff. But it was so strong relative to the last several years that is it more on the just high-quality revenue? And maybe what's changing compared to the last several quarters?\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nYeah, I think, Dave, I don't always look at one quarter. There's always puts and takes in every quarter. But if you look at a year-to-date basis, our operating income is up 9%, which is very strong. Our expense base is up a couple of percent. And I think it is a combination of all those factors that we've been really focused on. And there's not one thing, as you well know, that drives us from a results standpoint.\nIt's a combination of all the things that you talked about. It's the revenue mix of high-quality revenue. It's the operational effectiveness areas that we're making good improvement on. It's selling the right things that are dropping that through. And just continue to focus as an organization on continuing to be more efficient across the board. So, again, there's not really one or two things that stand out. It really is, when you look back at it, the overall business model and just making sure that our teams are executing that business model as well as we possibly can.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nHey, Dave, I would just add one thing. To your point of this notion we talk a lot about high-quality revenue. And in the quarter, we had lots of different discrete benefits: high-quality revenue, Mobiliti users, some one-time revenue, were able to offset some smaller license revenue. You have all kinds of things going on.\nI guess the only point I would make is because of how we've shaped the model, whether that revenue comes in through a Mobiliti user or it comes in from a one-time or occasional revenue, the drop-throughs are going to get better and better because of how we're managing the cost base overall. And we like that because obviously it gives us some margin and some business model expense leverage, but it also gives us the ability to invest at times where there are opportunities for us to invest.\nAnd, as you know, we're committed to raising margins 50 basis points to 100 basis points a year. And when things are going a little bit better, we'll look for ways to invest to take advantage of those where the perfect storm comes in our favor.\nDavid J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)\nGot you. Okay. Well, that's helpful. And then I also looked back, it looks like your guidance is for EPS to be down just a bit in Q4 sequentially. And I looked back, the last time that happened was Q4 2007 it looked like. So is Q4 a quarter where you're going to invest some of that away? I think you paid some bonuses a few years ago or at different times to spend a little extra away. Is that maybe what's happening this year?\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nThat's a good memory, Dave.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYes, it is.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nThat's a good memory. I think that was Q4 of \u2013 was that Q4 of 2007 or Q4 of 2008? I think it was an interesting time.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, yeah.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nWe do have a couple things going on in the fourth quarter that are going to have those expenses a little bit higher than what we had in Q3 here. There's a couple investments there. We do have a couple \u2013 a little bit of business mix. We're also going to experience higher commissions, as Jeff indicated earlier on. We're going to have some strong sales results in the fourth quarter. We also have our Fall Forum Client Conference in the fourth quarter.\nAnd then last but not least, we are self-directed or self-insured for our health claims, Dave. And we're going to have a pretty significant ramp in the fourth quarter this year compared to the other quarters. There's normal seasonality there, but it's going to be much bigger. And so those are all kind of four or five different events that are kind of impacting our Q4, a little bit higher expense level than we normally would have. And so, again, none of these things are really \u2013 when you look at it from a year standpoint overall, it's just kind of the way that things are kind of hitting that quarter.\nDavid J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)\nOkay. Great. Well, great job as usual. Thanks.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nThanks, Dave.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question's coming from Mr. Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and, Tom, you certainly will be missed. No question about it.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nThanks, Andrew.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.\nJeff, one of the things you've talked about as one of the sort of overriding themes from a strategic perspective is real-time payments. Could you just step back as you talk about high-quality revenue and the margin improvements you've been enjoying, and certainly disbursement is an interesting new offering and new functionality. Generally speaking, faster settlement, real-time settlement, is this all part of everything that's going into Fiserv's sort of innovation when I think about Mobiliti suite and so forth? Or is there a separate callout that we're going to be talking about a year from now or 18 months from now around a real-time payment suite of products?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nWell, I mean, we started to talk about that, Andrew, at Investor Day -\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.\nRight.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nAnd we've used a label of NOW to try to capture this notion of real-time beyond point-of-sale. Right? There's a big war that's going on at point of sale, whether it's MCX or whatever's going on out there. There's a lot of that. And we're really focused on the DDA-based payments beyond point-of-sale, and that's both payments and deposits. And so the product that we talked about that was Immediate Funds; that's around deposits. The disbursement product, that's not necessarily leveraging real-time, although certainly the businesses will have the opportunity to decide if they want to use a real-time rail to make that payment.\nAnd I only set that up as context, because the answer is I'm optimistic that over the next several years, we'll have lots of conversations that talk about leveraging all of the construction that's going on in the real-time space and linking that construction into our front-end applications and weaving that construction into the back end of our real-time payment system. And that will, whether it's Mobiliti or Popmoney or RXP or Immediate Funds or something that we haven't thought of yet, all of the different functionality that exists in the DDA \u2013 I think the example we used at Investor Day was being able to make a payment through bill pay and get immediate credit at a bank where a consumer has a credit card account. We see that all as options and ways to help consumers use the real-time networks that are being built right now.\nI think one of the confusions, as you well know, is which rails are going to be built. And so while we are to some extent in the business of constructing those rails, we also don't think that there's a single ubiquitous rail that we can build. We think we can enable people to use some of our technologies, and we will connect to other people's technologies. But we \u2013 our ambition is to bring that real-time capability to our applications to enhance the consumer experience, to hopefully drive revenue for the financial institution and value for the different users. So I know it's a longer \u2013 maybe a longer answer. But that's how we're thinking about it right now.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.\nOkay. So more to come in terms of this theme of really giving your customers or FIs the ability to drive more revenue in their businesses.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nExactly. And we've been planting a lot of those seeds, whether it was through the 2,100, 2,200 Popmoney institutions that we have today or the 6,000, \u2013 5,000, 6,000 RXP institutions we have today, and now bringing Mobiliti, right, all kinds of those. So the flags are being planted, right? The rails have to actually get caught up to allow more ubiquity in the back end.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up, with regard to International, are there assets out there that might make sense for Fiserv in terms of a significant step-up in international exposure? Is that still something that is central to the long-term growth plans?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nWell, I mean I would say that we have never said that international is essential to our long-term growth plans. What we have said is we see a couple of discrete opportunities \u2013 Agiliti is one of them \u2013 where we can create a boost to our internal revenue growth rate. But at the end of the day I think we have 6%, 7% of our revenue is international. It's going to be hard, even if you're adding a percent of internal revenue growth, it's going to be hard to call that essential to the company.\nTo date we've not seen large international acquisitions \u2013 I assume that you're asking a question around large \u2013 that that would make sense for our model. Frankly, we have seen so much opportunity in the U.S. right now that that's where our focus is. We certainly look at some of the assets that become available. But for right now the majority of the opportunity that we see international beyond the 6% or 7% of revenue that we're focused on today is really trying to make the world smaller, right? So allowing money to move more simply between the U.S. and Australia or the U.S. and India or the U.S. and wherever and back, right? And so looking at different technology solutions that may make that easy so that banks and others can facilitate the global movement of money simply, easily, and securely.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.\nHelpful Thank you.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Next is coming from Mr. Tien-tsin Huang. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nHi. Great. Thanks. I guess I want to ask \u2013 build upon Dave's question just on the margin front. I'm curious, given that you guys have outperformed year to date, and I caught the fourth quarter commentary. Have you considered sort of changing your investment sort of philosophy or the discretionary versus nondiscretionary mix, for example, just as we look forward into 2016 and 2017?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nWell, I think, Tien-tsin, what we said is that when \u2013 historically where we have been meaningfully outperforming our margin guidance, that to the extent that it makes sense for us and our shareholders and our clients, that there are ways that we can further invest and still ensure that we meet our financial commitments, we'd take a look at that. I think Tom was also talking about some of the timing of expenses that we believe that will hit us in Q4.\nBut that said, one of the things that we've talked about over time is the combination of the revenue model that we're building and the benefit of the operational effectiveness program really gives us more capacity to invest and grow the business \u2013 or frankly, not invest and let it flow through to the bottom line. So we're looking at that all the time, quarter on quarter, year on year, month on month, depending on what's going on.\nNow, you know well that we don't make large \u2013 it's hard for us to decide in a heartbeat to make a big capital investment. Most of our investment is through our P&L. It's linked to labor. So you have to hire people. So you can't make big decisions to change \u2013 I can't make a big decision to change my expense trajectory next week. But you can be sure that we have investments keyed up that we have an idea that where it makes sense that maybe we should deploy money in a different way.\nTien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nOkay. Understood. That's what I was thinking about longer term, because re-sketching that I know is tough in the short term. Just on the core system conversion side, I wanted to ask a question there. I know there's been a lot of DNA wins. You've had some big wins also like First Hawaiian and et cetera, including some Corillian stuff. I'm just curious. Year's almost done. Have you seen in hindsight here a bigger appetite for conversions? And how does that feel going into next year on the conversion side?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nSo we have seen more activity in the larger end of the base in 2015 than we have probably in the last five or \u2013 at a minimum, in the last five or six years. We have \u2013 there's more discussion and movement on the real-time core processing side of the house. We are not seeing a lot more activity below that level. We're seeing a lot of competition in the smaller \u2013 kind of in the $1 billion and below \u2013 in the below space, and so there are a lot of activity there. But we are seeing processes, RFP processes, evaluation processes going on. We've been pleased that we've been involved in that. We've actually been down-selected once or twice in pretty big evaluations, which is something that we would not have been able to do, frankly, had we not acquired DNA. So we are seeing some activity there. I think that'll manifest over time.\nOne of the beauties to that is the institutions that are doing the evaluation tend to know us because they're \u2013 maybe they're a Corillian client, they're very likely a bill pay client. In that space, we've got a number of really important solutions at PEP+, PEP+ clients, so they're using our technologies, and so we have a relationship with them. Whether that will ultimately get us over the finish line, we'll see. But we do think it has them give us more consideration than if we were one of the new kids on the block.\nTien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nGreat. Okay, thanks. That's good color. Appreciate it. And, Tom, thanks to you and obviously wish you the best.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nThanks.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question's coming from Mr. Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC\nHi, guys.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nHey, Ramsey.\nRamsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC\nOn EMV, I'm trying to understand better whether that $10 million in EMV revenues in the quarter, putting aside for a second the deferral issue that you pointed out, does that represent the material increase versus EMV revenues last quarter? What I'm trying to get a better sense of is, does this result signal any type of ramp that we're finally seeing this delayed EMV ramp, or is it just still business as usual?\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nYeah, I'll take it first and then turn it over to Jeff, Ramsey. I think we are seeing a tick-up, clearly. We didn't have this activity in the first half of the year. And clearly in the third quarter, it's building as we anticipated. So we did $10 million of incremental EMV manufacturing in the third quarter, which is much more significant than the second. We had to defer $9 million of that to future periods.\nBut as we laid out on Investor Day, as Mark laid out, 2015 is going to be the low water point. And it's building nicely as we look out into 2016 and 2017 and so that's the way I would phrase that.\nBut, Jeff, I don't know if you wanted to add something else to that?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, probably just a little bit more context. So the $9 million that we ended up deferring, we ended up deferring it, first of all, we had to defer it because it was the first time we had really meaningful EMV activity. But if you think about the $10 million of production for the quarter before the deferral, 10 times 4 is 40, that's $40 million in a year. If you go back and look at what we laid out for Investor Day, that would have been the start of a very attractive run for us.\nSo the answer is, yes, we saw a lot more production. We ended up needing to defer the $9 million of the $10 million. And we believe that that deferral will stay constant for a while. And so if you look through that, we would expect to be able to recognize a more normal amount of revenue moving forward.\nRamsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC\nOkay. Okay, got it. Changing topics here, ClearXchange had a recent change in ownership. It seems like the banks are trying to use (51:39) it up with some sort of fraud and risk-related assets that they have and potentially maybe focus a little more on the real-time side of things. Does this change the competitive landscape at all for you guys in that space?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, it does. Actually, I would say it does more than change the competitive landscape. I think it's quite a positive move for the landscape in general. Early Warning is famous for having very high-quality risk and analytics. And they do a great job. We announced a partnership with them at our Investor Day.\nWe're doing some very interesting work on the real-time side. Now, they have not traditionally been in the real-time payment world. They're in the real-time data exchange world and they're going to build out some capabilities. We're building a nice partnership with them and we expect this to be quite positive for the industry.\nRemember, ClearXchange is really the back-end of the process where they're enabling some of the engines for those institutions. Those institutions still need front-end applications. A number of those institutions that are in ClearXchange as well as more than 2,000 around the system use our front-end. So I'm hopeful and optimistic that this will move the industry closer to more ubiquity in allowing consumers to move money at the speed of their choice. So we're quite excited about it.\nRamsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC\nA rising tide lifts all boats mentality it sounds like, which makes sense. One quick last one from me. On Agiliti in the UK, is the rollout there still tracking to your expectations? I think you mentioned potentially rolling a customer out there towards the end of the year and the beginning of next year. Does that still sound like a reasonable goal?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, we would expect to be live \u2013 I would say at this stage because it's taken a little bit longer to get this first contract signed, it's a little bit more difficult when you're building a business from scratch, subject to all the regulatory approvals and everything else. But I would expect us to go live in the first half of next year with multiple clients. So we're really excited about that.\nRamsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC\nAll right. Terrific. And congratulations, Tom. And that's all from me.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nOkay. Thanks, Ramsey.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from George Mihalos of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\nUnknown Speaker\nHi. This is Allison (54:16) in for George. Tom, let me add my congratulations on your retirement. I just had a quick question within the Financial segment. I'm curious, and you can disaggregate a bit what growth trends you were seeing across core processing, item processing and the loan servicing businesses, I'm wondering if it's fair to say that the core processing business is growing above total segment revenue growth, while the other businesses are below?\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nI would say in the Financial segment, as you're aware, the larger share of our revenue comes from the core processing area. So clearly that's growing faster than our areas like check processing, which is in decline. So that is correct.\nI think the other areas that we have in there, lending has been growing nicely. But we have been impacted \u2013 our international business is in there, so our currency has negatively impacted that segment. And we should, over time, continue to see international contribute to that. But, to your point, item processing's a bit of a drag. The core is the big piece of growth that's in that particular area, along with our lending area.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nYeah. I would say, I mean just for clarity, that we have both seen some good growth trends coming out of the lending businesses and that we would expect, over the next couple of years, to see lending itself be an important part of how financial institutions are obviously going to drive revenues. So those trends, we think, will look better moving forward than they have historically, as people have not really been spending in that space.\nUnknown Speaker\nGreat. Thank you.\nThomas J. Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary\nThank you.\nJeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your attention and support. If you have additional questions, feel free to contact our IR team. Have a great day.\nOperator\nThank you. And that concludes today's conference.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. You may begin. Thank you.","Stephanie Gregor - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions, and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis of planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, the performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. Also, please note that we will hold our Investor Day on June 20 in New York City. Please watch your inbox for additional information.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Stephanie and good afternoon. We punctuated 2016 with 16% adjusted earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth in the quarter was 4% led by our domestic businesses, which performed in line with our expectations offset by a revenue miss in our international operations.","Adjusted operating margin, free cash flow and sales results were all strong in the quarter. We extended our double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth to 31 consecutive years by registering 14% growth for the full year. Internal revenue growth was 4% for the year, led by strong performance in our Payments segment.","Adjusted operating margin for the year was up 50 basis points to 32.2% which is even more impressive when considering the margin headwind from acquisitions during the year. We achieved record free cash flow in 2016 of $1.1 billion, which translated to a 14% per share increase to $4.84. Sales performance was also a major highlight, increasing 21% over the prior year.","Let me summarize our progress for each of you against our 2016 key shareholder priorities, which were first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments. Second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. And third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.","We continue to add high-quality revenue to our book of business, even as our 4% internal revenue growth was below our initial guidance. Our 2016 performance was led by Payments segment internal revenue growth of 6%, which included strong results across a number of our businesses.","As we noted in Q3's call, full-year results would be impacted by the timing of revenue, primarily from implementation and product delays, which as I mentioned was further compounded by a Q4 revenue shortfall in our international business. We believe our strong sales for the year combined with the benefit of client and product implementations coming online, support a step-up in our internal revenue growth rate in 2017. Company-wide adjusted operating margin expanded for the fourth consecutive year. The combination of gains and high-quality recurring revenue, combined with our strong operational effectiveness performance led to a 50 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin for the year.","Importantly, this increased performance has been achieved organically, as our recent acquisitions have actually been margin dilutive, which we expect will improve as we integrate and scale these new solutions. Our 14% growth this year in both adjusted earnings and free cash flow per share, clearly demonstrates value creation at the intersection of the hallmarks of Fiserv, a strong business model, operational discipline and consistent capital allocation.","Our second priority was to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. During the quarter, Salem Five Cents Savings Bank a $4.2 billion institution, selected DNA in a competitive process, along with a full suite of digital solutions from Fiserv, including Corillian, Mobiliti, CheckFree RXP and debit processing. Salem Five has also decided to adopt our newest solution, Messenger Center, for both large commercial and small businesses from Online Banking Solutions or OBS, which we acquired in December.","Messenger Center is an award-winning, sophisticated cash management solution differentiating on a mix of digital experience and leading functionality, which fits the size and complexity of the customer. We are pleased to have been selected by Salem Five as a partner on their go-forward vision of next generation technology and expanding commercial capabilities.","We were very pleased to have a more than 20% increase in DNA signings as compared to 2015. And importantly, we implemented 20 new DNA clients during the year including seven institutions with assets greater than $1 billion. We signed more than 220 clients to our Mobiliti ASP solution in 2016 while growing subscribers over 30% to 5.5 million. While we are pleased with our growth, the current subscriber base still represents less than 15% of the underlying deposit accounts served with our ASP product.","Mobiliti business also continued to prosper, more than doubling the number of live clients on the platform this year and nearly four times the number of end users. We remain very bullish on the size, scale and importance of the digital opportunities. Our third priority was to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. A huge priority in 2016 was to meaningfully enhance our upper end commercial solutions to better enable clients to serve their most important customers.","Early in the year, we bolstered our commercial services portfolio through a partnership with AFS to integrate their sophisticated commercial lending services with our account processing platforms. And as I mentioned earlier, we recently announced the acquisition of Online Banking Solutions, which meaningfully extends our sophisticated cash management, digital business banking and secure browser capabilities for large commercial and small business clients.","Today, OBS serves 13 of the top 100 banks, which is strong evidence of the quality of their suite of services. These cash management and digital banking services are already integrated with several of our account processing solutions and we are excited about the enhanced value we can deliver to our commercially focused clients.","We continue to see very strong client interest in Architect, our integrated online and mobile banking solution that serves both retail and business customers on a single platform. We have more than 150 clients live today and have grown the sales pipeline to six times the level it was when we acquired the solution nearly a year ago.","We handily beat our first year sales expectations and integration is progressing as expected. Last January, we acquired an innovative billing and payments platform that now serves as the basis of our next-generation solution dubbed BillMatrix Next. This platform is being extended to include the best of our current Biller platform, providing flexible multichannel billing and payment solutions for all size businesses, along with enhanced functionality for our large billers, and all with much faster implementation times.","We are also making these market-leading services available to our account processing clients to help them better serve their customers. As an early proof point, Bank of the Ozarks a $19 billion asset institution, chose BillMatrix Next in the quarter and was able to go live in less than 30 days versus a historical process, which could have easily taken six months or longer. We are excited about this new opportunity to serve the biller market more broadly and faster than ever before.","Towards the end of 2016, we also went live with Notifi, which empowers our clients to a highly customizable alerts engine that allows real-time communication with their customers. So far, over 50 clients have selected this differentiated product and are beginning to go live. Notifi is already integrated into several of our account processing platforms, online banking platforms and Mobiliti.","These are just a few examples of the new innovation we are bringing to market, to better enable our clients to win in the markets they serve. We expect our new solutions will scale over time, and make meaningful contributions to internal revenue growth acceleration over the next several years.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter increased 5% to $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.16. Internal revenue growth of 5% was led by strong performance in our Payments segment.","Overall, the revenue growth in the quarter was generally in line with expectations with the exception of international business, where revenue growth was negatively impacted by slower sales and some deal slippage.","These deals were concentrated in license revenue which created a rather large impact revenue hit for the international business in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to 32.1% in the quarter, due primarily to an easier prior year compare as we mentioned during the Q3 earnings call.","We marked the 31st consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth by achieving 14% for the full year. Full-year operating margin was up 50 basis points to 32.2% driven by primarily by Payments segment performance and a continued focus on operational effectiveness.","As Jeff mentioned, this performance is even better when considering the 30 basis points of dilutive margin impact from acquisitions. Our Payments segment continued to produce strong internal revenue growth of 6% for both the quarter and the year. Performance in the quarter was led by Card Services, Output Solutions and our risk management businesses. Adjusted revenue, which includes the results from acquired businesses, grew 9% in the quarter to $728 million and 10% for the full year to $2.8 billion.","Debit transaction volume growth remained in the high single-digits, and for the year was accompanied by a 10% increase in new client signings to more than 160 institutions. P2P transactions grew more than 30% for the full year, aided by a meaningful increase in Popmoney Instant transactions, which were up a stellar 375% over the prior year.","We further expanded our digital footprint, adding more than 220 Mobiliti clients and more than 350 bill payment clients during the year. Mobiliti ASP users were up 30% to 5.5 million subscribers for the year and they were up nearly 90% over the last two years.","And as Jeff mentioned, we're still on the early stages of helping our clients capture the unique opportunities presented by digital transformation. Payments segment adjusted operating income increased 8% in the quarter to $241 million, and for the year, was up a very strong 13% to $946 million.","Adjusted operating margin was down 50 basis points in the quarter to 33.1% due primarily to the dilutive impact of acquisitions. For the full year, adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to a new high watermark of 33.8% driven primarily by strong revenue growth in scale businesses and operational efficiency, which more than offset the 60 basis point negative segment impact from acquisitions.","Adjusted Financial segment revenue was $644 million in the quarter and $2.5 billion for the full year, which translated to a 2% internal revenue growth in both periods. We saw solid contributions from our lending and account processing businesses in the quarter, offset by the weaker performance, including FX, in our international businesses mentioned earlier. Although the Q4 international results were disappointing, a portion of the operational shortfall is timing based and should improve the results in 2017.","Adjusted operating income for the Financial segment was $217 million in the quarter and $823 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 33.7%, up slightly sequentially, and our strongest margin performance for the year. As a reminder, we mentioned on our last call that the Q4 2015 operating margin was unusually low, resulting in a comparative benefit primarily from business mix and timing of some of the larger expenses last year.","Full-year adjusted operating margin for the segment was 33.2%, declining 60 basis points primarily from the very strong prior-year performance comparison, the international shortfall, and incremental investments in some of our newer innovation-based solutions such as Agiliti and Notifi.","In the past few years, we've increased investments in the Financial segment and still the Financial segment adjusted operating margin has increased 60 basis points over the last two years. Corporate and other results were in line with expectations, and generally consistent with the comparable prior year's results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 35.6% in the quarter, up a full point over the prior year and the full year rate of 34.5% was essentially flat to the prior year.","We adopted the new rules on accounting for excess tax benefits for share-based compensation on January 1. As a result, we estimate our adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 to be slightly below 33%. And while the actual adjusted tax rate will vary each year on the basis of excess benefits realized, we anticipate our tax rate to remain generally at this level for the foreseeable future.","Our strong business model generated a record $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2016. Free cash flow per share increased 14% to $4.84, 9% higher than our adjusted EPS of $4.43 and $0.14 higher than our minimum free cash flow expectation for the year. We received a $10 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture in the fourth quarter and $150 million (sic) [$151 million] (16:07) for the year, both of which are excluded from our earnings and free cash flow results. Over the life of the investment, StoneRiver has produced more than $1 billion of cash distributions.","Total debt outstanding at year-end was $4.6 billion or 2.3 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, well within our targeted leverage ratio. We repurchased 2.6 million shares of stock in the quarter for $265 million. And for the year, we repurchased 11.9 million shares returning $1.2 billion to our shareholders. There were 215.5 million shares outstanding at year-end, and including a 15 million share repurchase authorization announced in the fourth quarter had 20.5 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.","Finally, earlier this week, we jointly announced an agreement to sell our small Australian item processing business to Genpact. This business is part of our international operations included in our Financial segment and represents less than 0.5% of our annual revenue. Given the end market and the standalone nature of this business, we felt another party could be better suited to run this business. The financial impact of this business is de minimis and is incorporated in our 2017 guidance.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Sales bounced back strongly in 2016, allowing us to print a record sales year. Sales attainment was 108% in the quarter, and increased 22% over the prior year.","Sales were up 21% for the full year, achieving 103% of quota. Q4 sales were led by our account processing and Output Solutions businesses. And domestically, were generally strong across the board. We saw a healthy increase in the number of new large deals signed for the year. And most important, even after a record sales year, our pipeline is very solid entering 2017.","Integrated sales were excellent in the quarter, increasing 17% to $105 million and up 14% for the full year to $292 million. We continue to see solid demand in areas such as Card Services, bill payment, custom statements and digital solutions.","We realized operational effectiveness savings of $64 million, meaningfully exceeding our $40 million target for the year. Savings were led primarily by procurement and workforce optimization. We also made very good progress on our data center consolidation, combining 18 locations during the year. Our operational effectiveness target for 2017 is $60 million.","There is palpable optimism in the banking market on the heels of the election, with increased conviction in a rising rate environment, coupled with regulatory reform. While it's hard to translate this positive sentiment to near-term results, we do believe that it could bias favorably for technology spend over the mid to long term.","For 2017, we expect clients to focus their spend on a broad combination of digital services, risk management, and in particular, cyber along with a return to investing in more revenue centric technologies, such as cash management and all forms of lending.","Lastly, we remain optimistic about bank focus and commitment on P2P through the Zelle consortium. We are excited to play a leading role in the ultimate system-wide adoption of this important initiative.","With that, let's move to 2017. At the start of each year, we provide context to help shareholders assess our overall performance. For 2017 our three shareholder priorities are, first, to continue to build high quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payments solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.","Financially for 2017, we expect our internal revenue growth rate to expand and be within a range of 4% to 5%, which as you may recall, includes any anticipated impact of foreign exchange. We expect our internal revenue growth acceleration to come from a combination of sources, such as the positive impact of higher sales, the recovery of the delayed implementations we talked about in Q3, less EMV deferral, and stronger organic transaction growth in some of our payments businesses such as Biller Solutions.","Given the natural ramp of new revenue and the number of larger sales transactions, we recorded in 2016, we expect Q1 to be the low revenue growth point of the year, and that the overall 2017, internal revenue growth rate will be higher in the second half of the year. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to grow in a range of 14% to 17% or $5.03 to $5.17 for the year. And that the growth pacing through the year would generally near the revenue growth trend. We also anticipate adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points for the year.","Lastly, we expect 2017 free cash flow per share will be at least $5.45 or minimum growth of 13% per share over last year. We exit 2016 with another year of strong financial results even as revenue was light of our expectations. We delivered our 31st consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, expanded operating margin, and achieved record free cash flow and sales.","Our business model continues to deliver high-quality results and we expect revenue growth expansion to be back on track for 2017. We thank our more than 23,000 associates around the world who work tirelessly, with passion and commitment, to deliver differentiated value for clients and shareholders alike.","Finally, we've named Paul Seamon to lead our Investor Relations team as of February 28. Paul has been at Fiserv for 10 years in a variety of financial-oriented positions and is well-suited for this new role. I want to thank Stephanie Gregor for her dedication in IR over the last three years and wish her the very best as she leads our financial planning and analysis organization.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. One moment please. Our first question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Great job again.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And I guess, first of all, you mentioned the sale to Genpact. I was just wondering about the acquisition in January, any metrics around rough size of revenue and if there is some margin pressure expected from that acquisition in 2017.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Dave, it's Bob. Overall, we're excited about the product and the solution that that brings to us. But from an impact to both revenue and EPS, it's a relatively small acquisition. And so you won't see a real impact. And of course it is fully anticipated in our guidance for 2017.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","And Dave, it's really a substantially a product acquisition. They have a nice footprint of clients and we expect that to be both sold \u2013 continue to be sold directly, but also \u2013 and the most important element of it in our current value proposition is to integrate it into other platforms to make our commercial services proposition substantially more robust.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you. Okay. And then your business is so steady and like every quarter is good basically. So, maybe if I just think long-term about margins, they keep going up. Is that mostly a function of where the most growth is coming from, is it just the highest incremental margin and maybe some of the lower growth products that you have might just be lower margin? Is that the main thing or is it just that you're cutting costs in certain areas and allowing margins to go up that way and maybe how sustainable is this over time, because it's been so good?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, that's a great question, Dave. And we'll probably tag team this a bit. It is \u2013 we have the very good fortune of having a business, which has any number of scaled businesses, whether it'd be an account processing platform like Premier or our debit processing business or bill pay, we've got a number of towers of businesses where we put lots and lots of money into the infrastructure. And as we invest, we can move those investments over large blocks of clients and large numbers of transactions. And because they're large processing engines, they tend to have higher incremental margins on the way in. So, that's number one.","Number two, as you know, we have had \u2013 we're in our third phase now of operational effectiveness, and we've done a pretty good job. We got, I think we got around $64 million in 2016 in terms of taking cost out of our infrastructure. Some of that drops through to the bottom line, but a lot of that goes back into product and allows us to invest into product in a more substitution way or pattern instead of it just being incremental. So we've got that as well.","And then the other thing is, several years ago, you may remember we were investing in some technologies like mobile, where we were having to invest in front of the curve. Because we tend to build these larger technology stacks and infrastructures, we have to build them before the revenue comes on and that compresses our margin. When the revenue starts to come on, we make it up here. It's one of the reasons why in Bob's prepared remarks, he mentioned that we are now starting to put more money into the Financial segment.","And so, we would expect to see Financial segment, which has really grown rapidly over last several years, maybe start to moderate a bit because we're putting these big investments in or putting the investments in there, some of them are larger, and then over time that will scale back up.","But we've said for a long time that we believe that we have a lot of room to continue to grow margin over time, even in the face of competitive pressure, because of the proactivity we have frankly in managing our cost base and some of the towers of scale technologies.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","I mean the only thing I'd add to that is things like datacenter consolidation, this is something Jeff commented on in the \u2013 or Bob maybe did in the prepared remarks, but we are really in year two of a five-year process. There is a lot of opportunity remains and something like that. There are any number of these things where we know we can become much more efficient and it actually enhances the delivery that we have for our clients, because of the efficiency that we're able to put into our operations. So I would agree. We got a lot of room to run yet.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. Great. Well, thank you, nice job.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you very much for taking the question.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Jeff, I'm just wondering if you can comment a little bit, in the U.S., I'm thinking particularly about the credit union market, but generally on the competitive environment and whether you've seen a change there. You've obviously done very well with DNA. So maybe you can discuss takeaways and maybe in pricing perhaps on some of those wins. I'm just trying to get a general sense of what you're seeing out there.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. And when you say credit union, Andrew, I assume you mean the core account processing piece of the credit...","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Exactly, right.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that across credit union and bank, and frankly everywhere, the market is competitive and it continues to be competitive. And as we've talked about on several different occasions, there's a dynamic in the market where there are more competitors chasing less financial institutions, and that's a pretty good formula for intensity.","And so we continue to see that. It is one of the reasons why we have been investing in the way we have in some products, such as Architect, as we mentioned earlier. And in fact, even Financial Messenger by OBS will also \u2013 our Messenger Center by OBS will also allow some of the larger credit unions to provide commercial services to their clients. So I think that's \u2013 we are looking to build a broader formula for differentiation around our account processing core value proposition.","Frankly, we think that DNA is the strongest \u2013 what's the right way to say it, is the strongest account processing engine facing off to the credit union market today because of the modern elements of the platform and the workflows, et cetera, et cetera. And frankly, we're going head to head with competitors that I'm sure you can imagine on a regular basis.","As far as takeaways, we typically don't give those numbers. But we're winning over our fair share of the beauty pageants that we're invited to participate in. So we feel good about where we're going in that space.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And don't let anybody ever say you're not good looking, right? Would you characterize the environment competitive we have as, I know you said consistently it's competitive, has it gotten more so in your view in the last 12 months?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So again, one of the problems is because all of us, all of the core competitors have both core and other products, it depends on what you're talking about. If we're talking about digital, everything digital is very competitive in terms of, you've got some competitors that you know about, you've got seven kids in a garage building new technologies, and it's pretty easy to put stuff out there.","So those, the fringes of the core processing platforms or the value \u2013 some of the interesting value elements of the core processing platforms are more competitive. And even in the credit union space, there are companies such as Corelation that weren't in the mix. A couple of years ago, you've got some folks coming in from outside. So I would say that the processes are more competitive. I frankly don't see a lot of different movement in the market as we sit here today, but it is incumbent upon companies like us, and I can only speak to us strategically, that we're building value propositions that will allow us to continue to prosper over the mid to long term.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And one quick one, Bob, could you perhaps quantify the benefits in your EPS guidance from the excess tax benefits from SBC?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I think the way to think about it is the slightly less than 33% tax rate is call it 1.5 points below what we've seen over the last couple of years, so 34.5% in 2016, 34.5% in 2015. That equates to in order of magnitude about $0.13, $0.14 benefit in 2017.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","And again, as we mentioned in the opening comments, that is something that we expect to see for the foreseeable future. So this is a step down and then holds for that \u2013 for a period of time.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's the non-GAAP tax rate, that 34.5%, okay. (32:34).","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","It's an adjusted tax rate, that's correct. But this change in accounting is GAAP driven.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you very much.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Good evening. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","For 2017, could you please quantify expected organic revenue growth and margin expansion between Payments and Financial segments and maybe just call out the drivers?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. From the standpoint of the 2016, we actually don't break that out \u2013 2017. We don't break that out between the two segments in our 4% to 5% guidance for the internal rate of growth. You can certainly expect like we've seen for the last several years, our Payments segment will grow faster than our Financial segment. But we don't give specific guidance between the two segments.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. What percent of your customers have completed the EMV card reissuance and maybe if you can just tell us what that breakdown is between credit and debit?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So you'll remember that, we're substantially a debit provider. And most people know that debit was kind of in the back seat relative to credit issuance, because of the differentials and potential fraud risk. We would say we're kind of in the middle innings of the reissue and we expect to continue to see benefits this year and next year. We also mentioned earlier in the year that we had our first major institution go to contactless. And we expect that that will also start to create a little bit of momentum in the market going towards the end of 2017, but certainly into 2018 and 2019.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And one last one from me, if you can just call out term fees in the fourth quarter and how that compares to last year, and your expectations for 2017?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","So, for term fees in the fourth quarter, as expected, we did see some growth year-over-year for the quarter. But on a full-year basis, as we described in our Q3 earnings call, we did see term fees down year-over-year. Overall license and term in aggregate was up call it about $10 million on a full-year basis. For 2017, again, we don't give that specific guidance.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Okay.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","But certainly incorporated in our overall internal rate of growth of 4% to 5%.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Christen Chen - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good evening. This is Christen Chen in for Ramsey. I guess maybe to piggyback off of Dave's question, just on the 2017 guide, aside from operating leverage and operational cost initiatives. Are there any other items to call out in terms of impacts on margins? I mean, potentially the acquisitions you all made in 2016 that was dilutive. Could make some contributions or are there any other items that we should be thinking about? And then also, does your guidance assume any share buybacks?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, on the margin question specifically, our guidance for the year is at least 50 basis points. We would expect that as we grow the acquisitions that we brought into the family that they would probably have some fairly de minimis impact on margin this year, because we have to sell and then it has to convert to revenue.","There could be something small, but the majority, the substantial, substantial majority of the margin is coming from a combination of revenue growth against scaled solutions and our efforts against operational effectiveness.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","And on share repurchase.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. All of the uses of capital that we contemplate during the year would be included in our guidance.","Christen Chen - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just switching gears a little bit, we've seen some of the PIN debit networks get more aggressive in terms of rolling out PIN-less debit and kind of authentications solutions that are relevant to signature. How far along are you all with that kind of process in terms of being able to handle signature transactions, and how do you guys see that debit market evolving now that Visa has backed off of some of their EMV related routing strategies?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. That's a really good question. We have been working on this technology for a couple of years in preparation for a day when the market could be more open and so we're, let's say, well prepared to take advantage of those opportunities where they exist. And we're excited about how the market is moving.","Christen Chen - Jefferies LLC","All right. Great. That's all from me. Thank you very much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider. Your line is now open \u2013 of Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Apologies. Can you hear me?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Jim.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sorry. I guess, apologies if this was already answered, but can you maybe talk about the outlook you see for bank consolidation this year and whether that's any kind of factor in terms of your outlook for this year and kind of maybe the impact further on out?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, we don't anticipate bank consolidation to be any, in any way meaningfully different than we saw in 2016. Although there is certainly significantly more optimism at this stage of the year than there was last year, the banking business is still tough. And there will continue to be winners and losers in the acquisition and merger wars, and we'll continue to win and take, hopefully, our fair share of those. So we haven't accounted for it specifically.","We don't sit here and say, that there's going to be a significant change in both termination fees or anything else. And specifically, with regard to 2017, because of the timing on deconversions, typically we have a good idea already of what that's going to look like. And so we would have factored a lot of that into our numbers already.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful color. Thanks. And then, not sure if I missed it or you mentioned it, but can you maybe talk about the DNA wins that you kind of achieved in 2016 and whether you expect 2017 to be better or worse than that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So wins in 2016 were roughly 20% \u2013 a little bit more than 20% greater than they were in 2015 in terms of number of institutions. 20 institutions went live. Of those institutions that went live, seven of them had assets greater than $1 billion. We did sign our largest DNA client ever in 2016 in terms of asset size. So we're quite excited about that installation. It actually opens up a new segment of the market that we're focused on right now.","Momentum in DNA is very strong and the combination of DNA, coupled with the steps that we've taken to enhance our commercial services capabilities, we think is a winning combination. So we expect to have pretty good pipeline building during the year and hopefully a few more wins. But over time, we expect that to be a very powerful combination, the pairing up of real-time straight-through processing commercial capabilities that already links up to our, what we would say is, best in the market retail proposition.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Hi, Jeff. Hi, Bob.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Ashwin.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I guess my first question is with regards to CapEx and what are the top two, three areas of investment that you're doing. I am specifically asking this question because, Jeff, you highlighted innovation, so that's where I want to go with.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I would say Ashwin that probably that the largest by a good amount right now is the data center work that we've got going on, both in terms of the consolidation, as well as improving the overall efficiency of those data centers and actually preparing to lower cost in the short-term, as well as gain scale in the long term. As we consolidate those operations, we build in best of class capability, as well as scalability.","So, we see some long-term benefits of that investment. That definitely would be the highest one we've got right now for 2016 and 2017 for that matter.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","And Ashwin, we are making a lot of different investments in innovation, make no mistake about that. But for better or worse, almost all of the investments that we make in innovation tend to be around people and we have a pretty conservative posture that we take on cap software, and therefore it's running through the P&L.","So, that's one of the things \u2013 one of the reasons why we highlighted the margin, the change in shift from the Payments segment, so starting to move some incremental investments over to Financial, because they \u2013 we don't capitalize the majority of them and they run through the P&L. That's where they're going to be seen.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. And then going back to the topic of competition and I appreciate the answer you gave a short while ago but when core deals come up for renewal nowadays, do you still expect that the percent won by incumbents would stay relatively consistent? I mean, there are, at least the way I look at it really the top two, three players tend to win most of the stuff that comes up and that's how it's been. And is that going to change? I mean, I'm kind of wondering why you brought up the topic of competition, heightened competition and FIS had done the same so.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I only brought it up because someone asked a question. Ashwin, I would say again it depends on the market. If you were talking about mobile banking, there could easily be 30 or 40 competitors for mobile banking, where frankly six years ago there were probably the account processors, the core processors and Digital Insight. And now it's a much broader space and that has spread to some of the payments capabilities and everything else that gets dragged along.","There is more competition on the credit union side of the house, certainly around core processing. And we have some non-U.S. competitors in the larger end of the market that we were not seeing before, who are in the market trying to take share. Conversely, what I would say is, at least, our data would say that less clients are switching nowadays. And so, the incumbents do have a \u2013 they do have a strong position, in that people are saying, I'd rather not switch my core because there's all these other things that I need to do, whether it's put in a new commercial cash management system or a new mobile experience or whatever the case may be, that's tending to take more priority than swapping core.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. My last question is with regards to, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how banks are at least beginning to look at some, let's call it, I think the term you used was, revenue centric demand which is a great term.","I guess the question there becomes, as your clients invest in this demand, is it more advantageous to potentially sort of lead with some sort of consulting or people-based capability? Do they look for that kind of thing? Being focused more on revenue growth, does it produce (45:54) any kind of benefit on pricing? Could you answer those sorts of questions perhaps?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So, I'll give you my perspective and others may want to add as well. It really depends a little bit on the size of the institution and what's their DNA. There are some larger institutions that do everything through or do \u2013 make a lot of their bigger decisions using a people-based consulting services to help them get to a place where they can make a technology decision.","And sometimes those consultants will have an impact or bearing on the actual technology that's ultimately selected. But for the majority, the substantial majority of the market, these decisions are not made via kind of the people-based services that you're talking about. Sometimes there are independent third parties who are helping the institutions to intermediate the buying decisions, they're running processes, buying processes and things like that.","But for the most part, on the kinds of products that we're talking about here, whether they'd be new commercial cash management or commercial lending or some of the consumer lending types of products, the solutions that are going to drive real tangible revenue could also be digital account opening, those types of capabilities, we're not seeing a lot of intermediation there. Mark, I don't...","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","I think that's exactly right. We just don't see that going on very much in the market. I mean, certainly there's anecdotal situations where that occurs. But it's more, far more the exception when we see it, than it is any kind of a trend. And as a result, we don't feel compelled to have to solve that problem.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","Our next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hey, how are you Jeff, Bob and Mark?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Jeff, you talked about, in the beginning of the call, banks feeling better obviously interest rates improving and also them hoping for regulatory relief. Has that yet resulted in better spending or is it that the banks just are anticipating this and when it happens, you'll see the spending?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","It would be more the latter than the former. It is right now, manifesting in conversations. So for example, I've had a couple of conversations this year with CEOs that I haven't had in a while and the conversation went something like this. So why don't you tell me what you have that can help us build our business? That's a different conversation than, why don't you tell us what you can do to help us save some money on our technology spend.","And that, that \u2013 I'm using that only as an example to say that, that is the feeling in the market right now. But as we said in the remarks as well, I see this to be much more of a mid to long-term benefit because, first of all, some things are going to have to happen. I mean opinions are changing, but something is going to have to happen that has people say, all right, I'm going to be able to lock in some benefit and now I can do something different with it.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","At this point, this is a 60-day phenomena.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","I mean \u2013 and we think it's going to continue, because of where rates are going and because of the prospect of regulatory kind of easing, but there's a long way between there and spending.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","And I would say that right now as we sit here today, our guidance clearly does not contemplate any kind of meaningful change in buying behaviors in the market.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And Jeff, if you look at the momentum behind the organic growth improvement for you in 2017, compared to 2016, is that the result of innovation, is it the result of that the banks needed to spend on things that you're offering? And just to take it one step further, what would change that momentum into 2018?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, the big drivers going from 2016 to 2017, probably the first \u2013 the most important item is sales. We had a pretty weak 2015, we had a weak Q1 and we had a very strong Q2, Q3 and Q4, and we have a fairly strong pipeline entering 2017. And so, a 20% increase in sales which obviously will have to get implemented over time much of those sales get implemented over time. We feel like that is something that is on the shelf, and now it's a matter of us getting implemented and having making sure that clients and the way we partner with clients gets that done. And we talked about that in Q3, how that actually had a little bit of a negative effect on us because we got delayed.","But that's point one. Point two is, we have some products that we talked about today, Notifi, being one of them. But Notifi, and Instant Issue, CardValet, IPS some products that we expected would have bigger benefits in 2016. And we're seeing some continuing aggregate demand there, and we expect that that will now start to come online and help us for better or worse coming off a lower compare in 2016 than we had originally anticipated.","We also, as we mentioned, are having some good traction in products like BillMatrix Next and Architect, which were previously not treated as organic revenue growing products, because they were in the first year of acquisition, and so we'll get some tailwind from that, little bit more EMV. Mobiliti will continue to grow, and then, probably the last thing I would say is, Zelle, right.","Zelle is predicted to go live in June, and if it goes live, we'll get some benefit. But the beauty there is, it has everyone looking at their retail payment strategies and how they fit. And some of our technologies like our IPS experience, which is a single-landing idea for account-to-account transfers, bill pay and P2P. We expect things like \u2013 technologies like that to have an impact. We talked about Popmoney Instant transactions I think being up nearly 400% for the year.","I think those are the areas that give us some comfort going into 2017. And frankly, the thing that could derail us is if something happens in the market where clients freeze up and they're not implementing or they're not moving forward. That is where I see the big risk in our numbers this year.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it, Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, good afternoon.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","So I guess, first, just wondering what happened in the quarter in international, maybe just a little bit more detail there. I'm assuming it was around Agiliti, but maybe just quantify what happened in terms of the shortfall over how much was timing versus something else. Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. It wasn't Agiliti at all.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","In fact, Agiliti, we had a couple of go-lives in Q4, which actually went pretty well and Agiliti is longer tailed revenue. So, an issue with Agiliti, we would have known. It was all really license-oriented revenue. So, high amounts of sales converting to impact revenue. The majority of those got pushed into 2017. And so we'll look for that lay in, in 2017, all things being equal.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then on DNA, would you mind just running through those numbers with us again and I'm curious how many of the DNA signings and implementations have been new clients versus existing ones?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, sales in 2017 were up 22% \u2013 institutions in 2016, sorry, were up 22% \u2013 20% (54:10) versus 2015 and implementations were at 20 and seven of those implementations were assets \u2013 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion. On the credit union side, it is you have a little bit more migration of existing platforms to new, but definitely we have new. And on the bank side, it's almost all new.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Got you. And then lastly, Jeff, when you talked about sales, sales were up I think 22% in the quarter. So strong number. Is that sales number measuring TCV sold in the quarter or is that kind of an annualized revenue from sales? I'm just trying to understand that.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","It's TCV.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Could you give us some sense of the annualized revenue growth? I just \u2013 I asked because I know that in the market, there have been a lot more sales that have been in kind of longer \u2013 longer and longer timeframes?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we don't provide that information. I will say that, that \u2013 the \u2013 the best way to think about it is the implementation cycles for the things that were sold, there were a couple of items we mentioned \u2013 a couple of big sales we mentioned in Q2 that we thought we were going to have shorter cycles. And lo and behold, they're going to end up being 12 to 18 month cycles. So I would say for the most part, the tracking of the implementation cycles is about on par with where it has been historically.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Guys, this is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us maybe some color on some of the new initiatives, CheckFree, DNA, Mobiliti, Popmoney, and even some of the newer ones. Does one of those, do you think, have opportunity to move the needle this year, maybe more than some of the others?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","We're all sitting here, thinking, we're contemplating the question. I think in the aggregate, they'll move the needle. The ability for any one of \u2013 I mean, the beauty of our model is it's a recurring revenue model and it builds in transactions over time.","The difficulty in our model is it's a recurring revenue model, which builds in transactions over time. And so, from our perspective, we care a lot more about how well are we doing at building the products and putting them into the market and having them drive value, so they're going to be adopted and drive revenue.","So yes, in the aggregate, they're going to move the needle a bit in 2017. But when you think about 2018 and 2019, that's where it's going to matter. And I would use Mobiliti as an example. I think Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks that Mobiliti users have grown 90% over the last two years, and that to 5.5 million.","To the extent that some of these products have the ability to do that and they do, in fact, products like Notifi are much broader based than something like Mobiliti. They can have meaningful impacts on the company for a long period of time, in terms of driving growth. But more importantly, they create differentiated advantages for our clients \u2013 for us, and therefore, our clients and that's why these solutions are so important.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","But the net effect of that is almost nothing can kind of pop in a given year and move the needle.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","In those kinds of products.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","In those kinds of solutions.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Individually.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes, that's right (58:11).","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And then keeping it on 2018 then, do you think that could be an acceleration year if the momentum continues? And then what would be an early indication of that taking hold?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, the answer to the first part of the question was, yes. And the answer to the second part of the question is, I think that's a better discussion at Investor Day.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Good to catch-up. I jumped on a little bit late, but just I guess, Jeff, following up on your comment around the potential for freezing of client spending, that makes sense, which reminded me to ask, is compliance revenue \u2013 how big of a contribution has that been in terms of new sales in the last couple of years and how big is it in terms of revenue now? I'm curious if that's an area where you could see some delays or deferrals.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So while compliance was at the top of everyone's list, I was frustrated that we weren't moving fast enough to put products into the market against that demand. So now when we think maybe compliance products will be a little bit more out of vogue. I'm not too concerned about the impact on our revenue.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, good. And I figured so much. And then just overall big picture, just thinking about visibility, I know you've gotten a lot questions around it, but just thinking about visibility in this environment today versus 12 months ago. How would you characterize that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Revenue visibility?","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, I'm sorry, revenue visibility, earnings visibility, however you want to handle that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Pretty, I mean, pretty high. We are blessed with, again, a business model that as you know has a pretty high degree of recurring revenue. And for the most part, we can see what's coming. The beauty of any number of the products and services that we've been building is, we're selling them fairly early. They're getting queued. The biggest issue that we will have is, if clients make decisions that delays implementations, especially large ones.","Yeah. That's \u2013 and to the extent that some of these products are dependent upon consumer adoption. Obviously, you've got an issue because of the intermediary role that the institutions play. But on balance, I think we're in reasonable shape.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good, good. Thanks, as always, for the update.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Condra of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, everybody. Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones, I guess, you didn't size that impact on the international kind of timing issue in the Financial segment?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","No.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, you mentioned dilution from the acquisition. Can you quantify that, the amount of margin impact? I'm just kind of curious how much you outgrew (01:01:24) that.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. So we talked about it, in terms of the full year impact in 2016. Had we not had that dilution, the margins for the overall company would have been up by about 30 basis points. For our Payments segment alone, it's about 60 points.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Okay, great. And should we think of that 50 bps as kind of continuing into 2018 the way to think about continued margin expansion?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes. And what we have said, Paul, is that we believe as part our long-term guidance, that we have the ability to increase our adjusted operating margin by generally at least 50 basis points per year on average.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Perfect. Okay, great. And then one just kind of broader question, I mean a lot of focus on H-1B visas and I'm curious if you have any kind of \u2013 like your mix of employees that work with those visas and how you're thinking about changes to that program and any impact you might have?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I think at this stage, we're paying attention to what's going on and we'll likely see how it all settles out.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Brett Huff of Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'll be quick.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Can you talk a little bit about the commercial cash management or Treasury Management, however, we wanted to talk about it. All of a sudden, it seems like there's a lot of focus on that. Jack Henry is starting to build their own. You guys bought a nice asset. What's the driver for that? Is it just sort of time or is it that banks are refocusing on that or have we just under invested in it, kind of what's changing in the market that's driving that do you think?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. So, Brett I would say that, it's a combination of factors. If you look at surveys, right now, of bank executives, who are making technology decisions or maybe business technologies that are enabled by technology, near the top of the list, you're going to see commercial cash management and commercial lending.","And so those capabilities, because they are serving the most important clients in the bank, have always been important, but they're becoming more important. And they're becoming more important because the retail profitability of the banks is getting compressed. And, therefore, banks are going to the places that they know, and that's serving their commercial clients. And the further up you want to move in the size of the institutions, so as you as you break through $1 billion or $3 billion or $5 billion or $10 billion, the commercial capability is the most important part of the \u2013 often the most important part of the analysis, the buyer analysis.","And so, that's why I believe you're hearing people talk about it. For us, we made a decision that said, we have been looking at building and we have built out our product meaningfully over the last three or four years. But our decision was, it was time to leapfrog the market. And we \u2013 the solution that we bought is a solution that the guys who did the business had been actually was the original magnet (01:04:52) guy, Dan Myers and he \u2013 this has been his life and he \u2013 they know how to build cash management.","It has gotten fantastic reviews. We heard it. We kept hearing about it from clients and it was a little bit of, if you can't beat them, join them. And instead of having to wait three, four or five years to build something and get into the market, because you really \u2013 this is an area where you need to have deep, deep, deep functional expertise. And we thought this was by far the most prudent way to go. And we are thrilled with the responses that we've gotten from our clients and prospects as it relates to this acquisition.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then just last one on P2P, I know it's been discussed a little bit. Any updates on your view on the game between bank-driven versus non-bank-driven peer-to-peer with PayPal starting to work more together with banks, I think, the distinction maybe got a little bit murkier. Any additional data or any additional thoughts you have on this peer-to-peer as it evolves, number one. And then number two, monetization of peer-to-peer other than express payments or is this more of a relationship we want to make sure our customers stay within our digital footprint?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, Brett, I would say, and Mark may want to add on to this. I would say that, it's been our belief that if you give a consumer a choice, would you rather move your money through a regulated financial institution or a company that is a merchant acquirer that they probably won't know what a merchant acquirer is, and they'll likely go with the regulated financial institution.","Now, I'm \u2013 it's a little tongue-in-cheek because Venmo has done well and those folks have done a nice job with it. No question about that. We are very aligned with what's going on with Zelle, and we are optimistic that, that through Zelle and Popmoney and any number of others that banks will end up being the primary place in which payments move from one person to another.","Our revenue model is based on transactions, and so while there may be no consumer-based transaction, as is the case in many other examples, we are providing a very safe and very secure product that allows that money to move with complete confidence to the consumer. And we've invested lots of money to make sure that we have the leading product in the market and we do. And we're excited about that. So we do see monetization there on top of the real-time instant opportunity that we talked about.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I'd add is, we do a lot of research and we are tracking the market and consumer attitudes around this whole space pretty regularly. We have not seen any change in the fact that consumers, by a large margin, prefer their financial institution, their existing bank or credit union, to be the provider of this service. And they are looking for a common network or a common brand through which to do that. And so we \u2013 that's why we are so excited about the prospect of the Zelle capability coming online.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. That's what I needed. Thanks again, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to give us a call. We also look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day later on in the year. Have a good night, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Ms. Gregor, you may begin.","Stephanie Gregor - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer.","Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.

Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.

These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.","Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. At last month's Investor Day, we shared strategy, our focus on annually increasing our rate of internal revenue growth, further expanding both operating margin and cash flow. And, most important, our plans to deliver compelling and differentiating value declines. We are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities ahead.","We delivered another quarter of solid results, including 4% internal revenue growth, strong margin expansion, and excellent free cash flow. Importantly, our results were in line with our plans and we remain on track to achieve our full year financial performance outlook.","Adjusted operating income growth was 8% both the quarter and year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin performance was exceptional increasing 120 basis points in the quarter to 31.8%. Adjusted EPS was up 17% in the quarter and is up 12% year-to-date. Free cash flow totaled $439 million for the first six months of the year and importantly, free cash flow per share through June is up a very strong 18% for the period. We also gained sales momentum recording a sequential increase in sales value of 11% in the quarter and a 10% increase over the same period last year. We are poised for revenue acceleration in the second half of the year and expect to exit the year positioned to increase our internal revenue growth rate again in 2016. Each quarter, we update you on progress against our three strategic focus areas, which given our recent Investor Day will be a bit more abridged than normal.","The three areas are; first, continue to build high quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solution; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients. We've executed well in the quarter and year-to-date, delivering 4% internal revenue growth, despite more than 50 basis points of foreign currency headwinds in both periods. Our high quality revenue strategy supported strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 140 basis points in the first half of the year.","Our focus on market differentiation breeds high quality revenue and that helped us sign Synchrony Bank with over $35 billion of assets to our signature account processing platform in the quarter, along with a broad suite of payment solutions. Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships, with an increased emphasis on our payments and channels business.","During the quarter, we added more than 100 new retail and business clients, to our Mobiliti ASP solutions, and exited the quarter with more than 3.5 million retail subscribers. Our focus on digital services has us positioned to deliver unique client value for years to come.","At our Investor Day, we shared our strategy for expanding biller services, as part of our commitment to further adoption of real time payments. We moved the needle in the quarter, by significantly expanding our on-demand payment relationship with Direct Energy, one of the largest utility companies in the nation.","We also signed a top 40 financial institution for our eBill and BillMatrix solutions in the quarter. And lastly, U.S. Bank, the fifth largest bank in the country selected Biller Advantage to provide electronic billing, presentment and payments to a broad range of its business customers.","We were also excited to announce that United Way, the largest privately supported non-profit organization in the world, will now allow any of the roughly six million U.S. donors to use Popmoney to make contributions directly from a digitally enabled bank account.","Interest in DNA remain strong, across all size institutions and charter types, which was again evident in our sales result. For example, Georgia's Own Credit Union, a $1.9 billion institution with over 180,000 members selected our DNA platform for its advanced technology, strong commercial capabilities and an open architecture, that will enable enhanced service to its members.","We have 11 new DNA clients go live in the first half of the year versus 15 in all of last year. We remain on pace to double the number of DNA implementations this year. As many of these clients have selected a full suite of Fiserv solutions, we expect to see revenue benefits across both reporting segments.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation for our clients. Our new Agiliti Solution was recently included on the innovators list for Transaction Services by Global Finance Magazine. This recognition is for banks and FinTech providers that use cutting-edge technology to disrupt the transaction services market.","We also had five clients recognize that the Retail Banker International Awards for initiatives executed in conjunction with Fiserv. These highly regarded awards focus on organizations that deliver excellence for their customers. We are pleased to partner with each of these organizations to provide technology and innovation that enables best-in-class results.","Real-time money movement is at the forefront of many financial industry conversations, which is right in our wheelhouse. We provide real-time processing capabilities for a number of clients, and accordingly real-time transactions grew over 40% in the quarter, and are up nearly 50% year-to-date. We also announced a strategic partnership with Early Warning services to further extend our real-time reach and capabilities.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon everyone. Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $2.4 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and for the year-to-date. Growth on a constant currency basis was 5% in the quarter, when excluding the 60 basis point negative impact from foreign currency. The net change in license and termination fee revenue was not material to our result, in either the quarter or year-to-date period.","Our focus on high-quality revenue growth and optimizing efficiency in our business model continues to pay off. Adjusted operating income increased 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date to $390 million, and $761 million respectively. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 120 basis points over the prior year to 31.8%. First half adjusted operating margin is up 140 basis points, driven by high-quality revenue and scale benefits across both segments, along with continued operational efficiency savings.","While we continue to expect strong margin performance, we have a more difficult margin comparison for the balance of the year, as the second half adjusted operating margin in 2014 was nearly 100 basis points higher than the first half of 2014.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.95 in the quarter. And, for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up 12% to $1.83, even with a $0.05 headwind from a higher year-to-date tax rate.","Now, I will move onto the segment detail. Internal revenue growth in the payment segment accelerated sequentially to 6% in the second quarter from 4% in the first quarter. Adjusted revenue was $627 million in the quarter, led by strength in our card services, biller, bill payment and digital channels divisions.","Results in our Output Solutions business were relatively flat compared to the prior year due to benefits from larger than normal breach reissuances last year and lower than anticipated EMV related revenue year-to-date. As we indicated at Investor Day, we continue to invest in preparation for EMV and enter the second half of the year with a good size production order book. However, we continue to see variability around the timing of EMV revenue especially in debit and prepaid, which is the majority of our secure card client base.","During the quarter, we further extended existing relationships with our market leading payment solutions signing 40 debit and 70 bill payment clients in the quarter. Transaction growth rates held steady with debit in the low double digits and bill payment in the low single digits.","As Jeff mentioned earlier, we continue to have success across our recurring revenue, Mobiliti ASP retail and business solutions. Payment segment operating income was up 12% in the quarter to $208 million and year-to-date was up 9% to $399 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment expanded 190 basis points to 33.2% for the quarter. Through June 30th, segment adjusted operating margin is up a very strong 130 basis points to 32.2% driven by high quality revenue growth and strong operating leverage.","Adjusted revenue in the financial segment grew 2% in the quarter to $609 million and 3% in the first six months of the year to $1.2 billion. Segment revenue growth led by our account processing and lending solutions divisions was partially impacted by a 70 basis point negative currency impact in the second quarter.","Operating income in the financial segment was up 3% in the quarter to $209 million. And for the first half of the year was up 6% to $413 million. Despite a very difficult prior year comparison, adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points in the quarter to 34.5%.","Through June 30, the segment adjusted operating margin is up 130 basis points to 34.4%. Our strong results have been driven by scale-centered growth in our account processing and lending businesses, along with benefits realized from our operational efficiency programs, partially offset by solution investments including our Agiliti platform.","Corporate segment net operating performance for the second quarter and year-to-date are in line with the prior year. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.6% in the quarter, which was slightly lower than the prior year. The adjusted tax rate of 34.9% through June was 180 basis points higher than the prior year's rate of 33.1% due to larger discrete tax benefits recognized in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect a 35% adjusted effective tax rate for the full year.","We are pleased with our strong free cash flow performance in the first half of the year. Free cash flow increased 11% to $439 million, and on a per share basis grew 18% over the prior year to $1.82. We anticipate much higher tax payments in the second half of the year, which will likely compress free cash flow growth in that period.","We took important steps to improve our long-term debt structure and flexibility in the quarter. First, we extended the maturity on our $2 billion revolving debt facility to April 2020. We also raised $1.75 billion of proceeds in a public offering of 5-year and 10-year senior notes, primarily to refinance nearer-term obligations. These transactions significantly extended our debt maturities, while lowering our weighted-average pre-tax cost of debt to 3.3%.","We continue to focus capital allocation on share repurchase; our total payout ratio was 121% of adjusted income. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of stock in the quarter for $245 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased 6.9 million shares at an average cost of $77 per share, totaling $535 million. At quarter's end, there were 235.2 million shares outstanding, and 12.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom. As I said upfront, sales in the quarter were up 10% over the prior year, 11% sequentially, and were 85% of quota. We saw a strong pipeline growth in the quarter across the company, including several of the areas we discussed in detail at Investor Day. We expect strong sales performance in the second half of the year.","Integrated sales were $67 million in the quarter, which puts us over our $950 million five-year program goal, about six months earlier than we originally anticipated. Our continuing strong performance speaks to the value of our integrated solutions, combined with compelling market opportunity. We've recorded $111 million of integrated sales through June or 44% of our full-year target. We've also realized $27 million of operational effectiveness savings to-date, in line with our goals for the year.","Going forward, we remain bullish on the opportunity to enhance our infrastructure through projects such as the data center and real estate consolidation in Atlanta, which is our largest domestic market area. We are pleased with our progress, and anticipate completion in Q4.","As we shared at Investor Day, the FI market remains stable. We continue to work with clients to leverage opportunities arising from the eventuality of interest rate gains, new sources of non-interest income and enhanced operational efficiency. Both financial institutions and merchants are marching cautiously towards compliance for the October EMV liability shift date and there continues to be a heightened level of discussion on faster payments.","As I mentioned up front, we remain on track to achieve our full year financial outlook, which includes another step-up in internal revenue growth. Internal revenue growth for the full year is still expected to be 5% to 6%, and as I've shared at Investor Day, will likely move towards 5%, primarily due to slower than anticipated EMV adoption and negative foreign currency impacts.","We still expect adjusted earnings per share growth to be 11% to 14% or $3.73 to $3.83, with a bias above the mid-point of the range for the full year. We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will expand more than 50 basis points, and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year.","For modeling purposes, we expect much stronger revenue growth in the fourth quarter, due primarily to the timing of EMV and license revenue, prior year comparisons, and revenue impact from new client implementations.","We're pleased with our results through June, and fully expect to deliver on our full year financial expectations. We are executing well in our existing businesses and making strong progress with innovation based growth. When taken together, we believe this will contribute to further acceleration of our internal revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. This only happens as a result of the incredible contributions of our 21,000 associates around the world, who work tirelessly each day to deliver quality, service and innovation to our clients.","With that Tori, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our first question comes from Mr. David Togut, calling from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is now open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Thank you. Good afternoon, Tom and Jeff.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Hi, David.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Jeff, you called out much stronger revenue growth expectation for the fourth quarter of this year. I gather that's from some of the DNA implementations that are coming on stream. Can you dimension for us, for example, what the 11 implementations mean for the back half of the year and additional implementations you might be seeing coming on stream in Q3 and Q4?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we had said that we plan to double the number of implementations for the year, which would put us in the 25 to 30 range for the full year. We did 15 last year. We're 11 to-date. So, obviously, we're picking up some of the revenue from those 11, but we expect to continue to \u2013 for those 11 we'll get call it in a range of somewhere between six months and eight months on average.","But we'll also get revenue from each of the remaining implementations that go live in the second half of the year. And that's both in DNA as well as all of the surround solutions that go with it. We've been fortunate that a large majority of the clients who have selected DNA have also selected a broad suite of our solutions to go along with that.","In addition to that \u2013 to DNA, we also have, as you'll remember from our last couple of Investor Days, talked about the large \u2013 the progress that we made in the large, in the large \u2013 primarily in the large bank space. And so, a number of those clients we also anticipate going live in this year, so we're starting to get the benefit from again the account processing platform revenue as well as the surround revenue that goes with them as well.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Putting that all together, should we expect the financial segment revenue growth to exit the year closer to the mid-single digits, closing some of the gap we see with payments, which has been by far the fastest growing segment this year?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah, Dave. We're going to continue to see acceleration in both segments in the second half of the year. So, yes, I mean clearly the segment is impacted by license revenue and different sorts of things like that, but we are clearly going to have an acceleration as we look into 2016 in the financial segment in the back half of this year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we would also expect to see continuing acceleration in the payment segment. We're going to expect to see them both accelerate as we exit 2015.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. And Dave, to your kind of point on both of the segments, I think the other thing that Jeff highlighted, he talked about the core processing segment, but in the second half of the year, we clearly have the biller headwinds that we've been talking about in the first half of the year and that business continues to do very well from a transaction growth and a new sales standpoint, so we expect a very strong second half in our biller business. Clearly, I highlight on the call also that our Output Solutions business, which includes EMV was fairly flat compared to the prior year and the first six months of the year.","And again, we expect good revenue acceleration in both the base business in that Output Solutions business and also with EMV. And then, in the fourth quarter, specifically some stronger license sales in regards to that, which is usual, but it's going to be a little bit more heavy this year. So, those are some of the things that give us good visibility and confidence as we look into the second half of the year.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Got it. And then, a quick final question. Any thoughts, Jeff, on PayPal's acquisition of Xoom, and possible impact on the B2B space?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, I thought the Xoom acquisition was a good acquisition. From my vantage point, it looks like a good acquisition for PayPal being able to leverage not just the large number of accounts that they have in the U.S., but they have a very attractive worldwide footprint and I think Xoom has built a nice revenue model, but a good technology platform that will be likely valuable for them as they continue to move forward. I see it to be interesting, but not that impactful again from my vantage point to P2P more directly, but I do see it be valuable within the Pay to Pal, I'm sorry, within the PayPal network. But more importantly creating a much larger visibility to a cross-border capability that a lot of digital users don't have access to today.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Understood. Thank you. And Tom, I appreciate the June 30th share count as well.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Sure, David.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question comes from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is now open.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I guess I'll just build on the last question, but just sort I want to understand a little bit better, the visibility to the back half organic growth acceleration, I mean in your 4% year-to-date sort of implies at least 6% kind of in the back half. And your commentary on the fourth quarter suggests it might even be higher than that in the fourth quarter. So, maybe 7%. But is it \u2013 do you have the visibility just based on the DNA conversion, some of the large bank account conversions and some of the headwinds, whether it's the biller headwinds or the output headwinds, just sort of abating? And I guess what I'm getting at is, how much incremental new book \u2013 books of business do you need to sign, or is it just a function of really the conversions just happening as you planned?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Glenn, there is always going to be \u2013 even though, as you know, the substantial majority of our revenues recurring, I think we said at an Investor Day, it was in the 80s, it was last year it was about 86%. We still have always continue to sign business. And as you know, revenue, a few million dollars of revenue can impact your growth rate in any quarter.","From our perspective, we have a pretty darn good visibility to the big chunks of revenue that we need to be \u2013 we need to deliver in second half of the year. And as we commented on, we think it will buy us even further to the fourth quarter.","The big blocks of revenue as Tom talked about, just to reiterate, are the revenue that's coming from the conversions. DNA is the one that we've talked about a lot, but we have DNA in our signature platform. Frankly, we've got good sized clients coming in there that will spread across both of the segments.","The second area is in our biller business, as Tom referenced again, it's growing quite well. And we also have the benefit of some headwinds that have now abated, as we crossed the threshold of the middle of this year. And so, we get the combined benefit of better compare and some nice growth.","The third area is really around our Output Solutions business, which is responsible for EMV. We talked about the size of our production book, which is quite strong. It's really a matter of when are the banks going to take delivery of the product, when are they going to be ready for it. We've indicated that it slips based on what our internal expectations were at the beginning of the year. It's not \u2013 it's not of demand item at all. In fact, I think demand is probably in better shape than we would have anticipated it to be holistically, but the timing of the revenues has been slipping, that's why we believe, we're going to have a pretty nice boost and likely going to be biased into the fourth quarter.","And then the last thing is around license revenue. We do expect to see more license revenue based on what we can see in the pipe coming in, in the fourth quarter of this year, and we also had \u2013 we had a little bit of a tougher compare in the third quarter, that's why that growth will look a little bit stronger in Q4. So overall, we have pretty good visibility to those numbers. We have actually good strong \u2013 good solid, I'll say, visibility into how that will translate \u2013 that exit rate will translate into growth into next year like we talked about at Investor Day. We have a pretty high level of confidence that we'll be able to grow \u2013 add that 50 to 100 basis points of growth in 2016.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, similar question on the margin side. Tom, you sort of, I think, were prepared for this, but up 140 basis points year-to-date and the guide is for, now greater than 50 basis points. Is there any sort of incremental investment in the back half or is it just the function of sort of somewhat of a tougher comp?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah, Glen, I would say obviously, we are \u2013 we're are very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year in the margin side. It was ahead of our internal expectations, really better performance and some timing. That said, we clearly expect to exceed 50 basis points of margin expansion for the year, given where we are in the first half. But we do, as you mentioned, we face some more difficult comparisons in the second half, mainly around 2014 because the second half was about 100 basis points higher than the first half of 2014. So, but there is nothing else unusual going on there. We're going to deliver good margin performance, but we do have some tougher comps. And we'll clearly exceed 50 basis points for the year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Glenn, the other thing I would add to that is, when you heard in our prepared remarks that we talked about, that we now expect that on our adjusted EPS for the year, that we now have a bias above the midpoint of the range for the full year. I think that really begins to reflect the fact that our margin, as we talked about will absolutely be greater than the 50 basis points. And we think we've picked that up there.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Hi, guys.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Hi, Ramsey.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ramsey.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","I have a question on \u2013 you mentioned another bank in Georgia taking \u2013 a relatively larger asset sized bank taking on the DNA platform. Can you speak a little more to the opportunity there for DNA, kind of up-market at the larger asset sized banks, is the pipeline there growing, are you seeing incremental interest, deploying that solution in a segment of banks that maybe you didn't intend to \u2013 didn't factor on to begin with?","Mark A. Ernst - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Ramsey, this is Mark Ernst. Let me take that. The reference was to Georgia's Own, which is a credit union. And we've had great success with DNA with the credit union market in general, and continue to have a strong pipeline in the credit union market. I think your question really goes to the topic that we kind of covered at Investor Day, which was that one of the things that has been surprising \u2013 a bit surprising to us, pleasantly, with DNA is that that technology is kind of opening doors for us in larger \u2013 the larger bank market for some banks that are looking for that kind of technology. So we've got a nice solid pipeline of institutions that are looking at that as a possibility. Now clearly, the sales cycle on some of those transactions is a bit longer, because of the size of the institution. But yeah, we clearly see that in our pipelines.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","And Ramsey, I would add \u2013 the only thing I would add to that is as Mark referenced at Investor Day, we did talk about our happiness with how we're doing with DNA in the larger bank space; that was an area that we had not anticipated, specifically in the large in-house real-time market, and that there are several \u2013 there are several opportunities that we're working on and involved in. And the beauty of that is, we are competing against platforms that frankly, not just some of the domestic platforms, some of the platforms outside the U.S. And the more swings we get at the plate, the more likely it is that we're going to begin penetrating that space. And frankly, as we begin penetrating that space, we have a pretty high degree of confidence that the combination of that technology with our surround solutions, with our expertise and knowledge of the U.S. banking market, is going to make us quite formidable and turn into some very attractive revenue over the next call it \u2013 the next two years to four years.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Great. Yeah, I misheard you, I guess in your prepared remarks, in terms of the size of the bank and whether it was a credit union or not. But thanks for this color. That's very helpful. So I wanted to ask you a kind of a longer-term question. It seems like there's a little more buzz these days with cloud-based offerings. Obviously, you guys have Agiliti, I think Temenos is building something, Fidelity is working on something, I think Infosys has something out there. In the U.S. specifically, do you see any change in the appetite of banks to put their \u2013 smaller banks that you service to put their core accounting processing in the public cloud? And I guess the question is sort of, if they become more comfortable doing that, does that open up the door to new entrants or competition in a way you have not seen in the past? I know it's a relatively long-term question, but just curious on your thoughts there?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. Sure, so it's an interesting question that sometimes bounces from conjecture to nomenclature, and what I mean by that is, most of us who have been providing outsource services to banks for years and years, would say, we didn't know it, but we were basically offering cloud-based services and we continue to do that.","The question of, does the utilization of a public cloud allow \u2013 change the barriers to entry in the business? I suspect, I suspect the people who are trying to get in, would say, yes. We would say that at least our belief is that the public cloud as we know it today, doesn't have the robustness that would be necessary to support the regulatory environment. And there are some private cloud utilizations that I think could come in and we're certainly looking at that as a way to provide the most modern technology solutions possible.","But I would say that yes, it will allow people to talk about being in the market. The reality is in order to make a solution like that work you have to win enough clients to get the scale. So, that the investment makes sense and it's just a \u2013 it's a long, long road to get there.","Ultimately, I would not be so bold to say no one will that crack that code. Someone may crack that code, and I can tell you that we're looking for what are the best ways to use these emerging technologies to make sure that we have the winning solutions in the market.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","That's terrific. Thanks for your comment.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. On the DNA activations, and customers going live, I think, Jeff, you talked about before 30 wins coming online, I think, you said something in the range of 25 wins to 30 wins coming online when you talked about today. Was there any change in terms of your expectation in terms of anybody pushing off into 2016 or how should we just think about the confidence level in terms of getting that 25 wins versus the 30 wins number?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Jim, thanks for asking that question. I realized when I was saying it, that I was going to look for an opportunity to correct that. I originally said 25 wins to 30 wins, because I was trying to recall if it was 14 wins or 15 wins and clearly it was 15 wins and clearly we planned to bring 30 wins live. So there's been no slippage in that. It doesn't mean that there won't be, but we have every reason to believe that we will put all 30 wins online this year.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, that's really helpful. And then I guess benefit of riches, but in terms of the integrated sales target, now you've met the five year goal six months early, can you give us some color on how you're thinking about the next two years or some other kind of timeframe beyond this?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah, I would say that right now, we are looking at making sure that we continue to deliver generally the level that we have had over the last, over the last several years. And as we get further down the road on some of these newer technology initiatives, whether it be our Integrated Payments Solution, or our NOW Network, or the next-generation capabilities of Mobiliti, I think you'll see us likely look to put some new targets out there. But for now we're going to continue to run \u2013 at the plate, at the level we're at now, look to build it up.","And we know that the only way that we can really grow since there are not a lot of new financial institutions in the market is by selling more deeply in. And in fact one of the things that we're quite focused on is, the \u2013 we traditionally have set this up as a way to expand the privileged relationship that exists on the account processing side.","One of the comments in our prepared remarks was actually signing a top 40 financial institution to some of our biller solutions. That \u2013 that interestingly, is a lending client, that was referred to our biller area. So, we're really now, over the last \u2013 over the last 18 months really been building some muscle in building \u2013 in building out that ability to identify good \u2013 good exciting solutions for us to deliver from \u2013 to our non-account processing solutions.","And then, also beginning to bring our account processing area into \u2013 or being able to cross over into some of the account processing solutions. A couple of the \u2013 these new DNA solutions that we're out pitching right now to these larger institutions, both of them originated out of relationships that we have in other payments and channel solutions, where we have credibility with those clients and therefore they're looking at us to bring in \u2013 potentially bringing in DNA. So, we're building a lot of muscle in there regardless of the fact that we haven't set a new program goal.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And just a quick housekeeping question. Any moving pieces to think about in terms of term fees for Q3 and Q4?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, great. Thanks. I'm just curious about sale cycles. It feels like it's improving, is that the case? I heard the wins like Synchrony, lot of good wins on DNA, just curious how the sales cycle is shaping up?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah, I would say Tien-Tsin, that we have continued to have momentum in our results. I would actually say that our first half sales results were a little bit, even though they were nice performance against the prior year, they were a little bit lighter in the first half of the year than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year. Now, we've seen a lot of strength in our pipeline, and we're quite bullish about prospects in the second half of the year. But that said, to be a little bit more direct on your question, I would say sales cycles are feeling about the same in terms of duration. I don't see any big changes in there and I would say that there is a lot of interest in the market to look at things like real time areas in which we see operational efficiency. And frankly some of these new products we talked about immediate funds at Investor Day, but some of these products are going to drive high quality fee revenue, we're seeing a lot of interest in those arenas.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, just to, I guess, clarify maybe build on that. What exactly drove the acceleration on the payments segment, if you can just rank some items?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You mean in the second quarter?","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In the second quarter, yeah.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It was really kind of continued growth across the board in three or four businesses there, continued acceleration in our card services business, our bill payment business, adds some incremental to our channel business, which is our online and mobile business. And then a little acceleration from our biller business. But those headwinds in our biller business are still in there in the second quarter. So, those completely go away in the second half. So, we're going to continue to see some good ramp. So, really good growth across all four of those businesses.","And I would also say that as I highlighted the one that has not performed at the level we anticipated as planned was our Output Solutions business, and you kind of see that on our P&L on the product revenue line item. But given EMV and some prior year comparison in the base business, that business was flattish. So, again, we continue to have good momentum in those other businesses, as we head into the second half. And we should see a much improved performance in our output business in the second half.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I understood. Just one more if you don't mind. Just the United Way win, I thought that was a cool one, because it fits pretty well with your the NOW Network. But I'm just trying to understand a little bit better, the integration that's required on the United Way side, do you work with the acquirers to turn Popmoney on as I guess I call the payment tender. Just trying to understand how it's scaled using United Way as the case study if that makes sense?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's a good question. So, we work directly with the United Way to integrate. We see one of the interesting use cases we see with Popmoney is, we think about it simplistically as a disbursement use case. So, allowing us to basically allow a consumer or a business to move money to another consumer or a business. And so, it feels a little bit more mechanically, it feels a little bit more like an ACH as opposed \u2013 an ACH receipt, as opposed to taking it through an acquirer on a point-of-sale basis. So, they'll have that payment capability up.","Now, we will \u2013 we're going to have to get it integrated into our bank partners, we'll have it available on the public site, but it will take about six months to get it fully integrated into the actual bank based product. But we have a lot of \u2013 we think it's going to not just drive transaction volume, but we like the visibility aspect of it, kind of the billboarding aspect of it quite a bit.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, it's interesting. Thank you.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Sir, your line is now open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, hey, guys, great job as always.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Hi, Dave, thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And just a couple of questions on cash. First of all, with the refinancing, you ended the quarter with $530 million of cash, which usually you end around $300 million. And I'm just wondering with that extra cash a little more than normal, I mean, do you expect to deploy that and bring it back down to $300 million through repurchases, or anything else kind over the next quarter?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we're \u2013 Dave, obviously we're going to redeploy that cash to enhance shareholder value and we have a number of means to able to do that, but as you know our debt ratio right now, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is at the lower end of our range. So again we have a number of options with that cash, that's seen on our balance sheet at June 30, but we're going to continue to redeploy that to build shareholder value.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great and then the second one. I was just looking back at CapEx and from 2008 to 2012, every year it was kind of $200 million or a little less than that even on a full-year basis. This quarter was $113 million just for the quarter, and it looks like over the last couple of years, it's trended up a bit, and I guess, I'm just wondering what's behind that. Is that kind of investments into Open Solutions that are \u2013 or what else and should this higher level be sustainable.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And Dave just so, you know, we have about $50 million, that's in our footnote, that's in there in CapEx associated with our Alpharetta primarily leasehold improvement, that's our largest domestic location we have. So, we're consolidating just from a real estate standpoint about 10 locations into one facility. We're also consolidating two of our larger data centers into our data center infrastructure.","But, Dave, we incurred about $50 million of leasehold improvements in that CapEx number through the first six months and so that's what's driving that. We're going to continue to be at 5% to 6% of revenues on an ongoing basis. This is one of those things that's going to occur largely very infrequently just because of the fact it's our largest domestic location and again their leasehold improvement. So, when you take that out, we're going to be up to 5% to 6% range and most of our investment as you know really goes through our P&L from a standpoint of development dollars, et cetera.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, yeah. Totally makes sense. Well, great job. Thank you.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Darrin Peller from Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks guys. Look, I just want to hone in for a minute on the margin again, I know you mentioned the mix before, but I mean obviously 190 basis points is a pretty substantial increase in the payment side in particular. I guess number one and just make sure there is nothing unusual there like a term fee or anything else that may have lifted that. And if not, let me just talk about the sustainability of that kind of expansion, given if this is all about mix and operating leverage, I mean, it's obviously a great sign for the future. So, maybe the key parts of your payments business that have such a high level of operating leverage versus the other parts that may not, I think that'd be a great understanding.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. Darrin, we appreciate that question. And again, we're really pleased with our overall margins and I would say that clearly in our payments businesses inside that particular segment, our card business, our bill payment business, and also in our biller business, we're at scale in those particular areas and continue to really have very good operating leverage and very focused on that, very focused on bringing in high quality revenue.","I would say, outside of that, our output business clearly doesn't have that same type of margin dynamic from a long-term standpoint. And that's probably the business in there that can move around with EMV as we kind of talked about, as Mark kind of highlighted on Investor Day. We don't see it having a big impact, but that can kind of move around as that revenue kind of goes around, but we feel good about our margin performance. Clearly, it was above our expectations in the first half of the year, but we're going to continue to focus on driving high quality revenue, and we'll continue our strategy as we've laid out.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Darrin, the only thing I would add to that is to say, as we've talked about a number of times, we have a mix of super scaled solutions, bill payment and debit. We have a lot of solutions in that segment, which are growing into themselves. And it will be a long time until they scale. And I only bring that up, because we do believe that that is one of the big, big points of validation on why we believe we'll be able to continue to grow the margin at the level that we've talked about. I don't believe that we'll be able to grow it at 190 basis points on a continuing basis, but there is a lot of runway just by the very nature of these systems, which are big scale systems, you put a lot of money into them upfront, and then the revenue comes on slowly over time and it flows through nicely.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. That's good to see. I mean, I guess looking into next year, are there any other big investments needed to keep up pace with the size and scale you're turning into?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Darrin, I would say there continues to be things, clearly as Jeff highlighted, right. And if you look at our Investor Day, a lot of those initiatives are inside of our payment segment, whether they be IPS or NOW, we're going to continue to invest in our mobile strategy, which is a big part, and continue to invest in there and in online.","But again, clearly our performance was very strong in the first half of the year. We're going to continue to make the necessary investments that we need to make to continue to grow our top line over the longer term and we'll continue to do that. But we clearly have some good scale businesses in our payments segment, and that should continue as long as those businesses continue to grow at the levels they are.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other thing I would add is that we are \u2013 we always talk about our operational efficiency measures \u2013 metrics and initiatives, a lot of those are paying off for us, and there is no reason to think they won't continue to work for us.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. All right, that's helpful guys. Just one last quick one, I mean, in terms of the items that you \u2013 it was helpful before, I think Jeff, when you talked through all the items that are going to help for acceleration in the second half and into next year. But just to remind us, sort of the unusual items that had the impact as a headwind in this current year, which abate (48:07). Can you just remind us of those couple of items again? I mean whether it's the term fees or it's certain contracts that moved away or whatever, but obviously that abates into next year and that helps acceleration also?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. I think Darrin, I think a couple and then I'll turn it over to Jeff. I mean, clearly in the current year we're having a currency impact, right, that's higher than what we anticipated.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","So, when you look at our 4% growth in the second quarter, right, would have been 5% on constant currency basis. So...","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","We clearly have a headwind that was roughly 60 basis points in the second quarter, that's something that was out there. We talked a little bit about the biller business, and some headwinds there in the first half of the year, which are dissipating clearly as we get into the second half of the year, and we did also talk a little bit about output in the first half of the year, given the fact that we had a tough compare. And those are probably the three that I kind of see from kind of things that are out there from just a headwind that as we look out into the future, we continue to believe that some of those will clearly go away.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful guys.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yep.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I think that's it from me. Thanks.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you, Darrin.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Sir, your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I appreciate the insight into the drivers of growth accelerations. I know investors are keenly interested there. You mentioned I think Jeff, a 40% increase in real-time payment transactions in the quarter, maybe 50% in the first half if I caught that correctly?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's right.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Can you talk a little bit about, at what point you think it's reasonable for us to expect that real-time, in the context of mobile in particular where I know you've made a big push with your Mobiliti suite, will start to move the needle in payments. Can we consider that as a 2016 event or is that overly optimistic?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So. That's a great question. We think about that all the time. I think we will start to see \u2013 I think we will see the seeds in 2016 in terms of beginning to create somewhat of a tailwind, but I don't think we're going to see the real growth benefits start to lay in until 2017. And I do think that it will be a bit of a wave. Once it starts, it will be very, very difficult to stop it. I think it will grow rapidly and I think the clients will become attached to that kind of a service delivery whether it is real-time credit of a deposit or being able to send money to a family member immediately, or even paying a bill as if they were at a biller website. So, as I think about it, I really do think we'll see some level of growth in 2016, but the real measurability will be in 2017.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And it sounds like you remain pretty confident that customers will indeed pay for those functions in the context of what is currently a free P2P environment in the U.S.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's right. But remember, P2P, in fact P2P would be the smallest of the near-term use cases that we would see for that. We would see \u2013 I would see bill payment, kind of the RXP-based bill payment service where we have 1.4 billion, 1.5 billion transactions a year. It doesn't take a very high percentage of those transactions to really move the needle on real time. I see real-time mobile deposit being a very interesting use case, where we today there are many, many banks in the U.S. who are charging relatively nominal amounts anywhere from a $0.25 to a $1 per deposit or per item depending on the institution to use those remote mobile deposit capabilities and I think there is an opportunity there. And then, of course, I do see P2P and then I see B2B as another very intriguing use case.","So, yeah, I am bullish on that. I'll tell you what, if you ask me where are my nervousness is, it's not on the transactions, it's on the price per transaction and the nervousness is only not \u2013 if there is one billion transactions that are relatively small amount or 100 million transactions that are relatively large amount, it's still are going to create a very interesting scalable opportunity for us, but more importantly for the financial institutions that offer that service.","So, I do think, I think there are number of ways that use case will come together and we're really excited about it over the next several years.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And quick one for you, Tom. You've done a great job on working capital management, another good quarter. How much more room do you have to improve cash flows from that particular source?","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. I think in the working capital side, clearly, we have a relentless focus internally around continuing to improve that. But clearly, we've done a lot out of that, but we \u2013 our business model, as you well know, our free cash flow per share has been very consistent above our adjusted EPS. Probably running at 10% plus a year over the last five years, pretty consistently. So while we continue to manage and improve working capital, do I think that there's lot there? No. Do I think we'll continue to manage that tightly? Absolutely. And so, that's how I would kind of hone in on that question.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Jeff, just wanted to see if I could get your outlook on the business, maybe what's outperformed so far year-to-date better than your expectations? And then, what's kind of underperformed that needs to be fixed as you kind of look into going into the back half of the year (54:17) into 2016?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Bryan. I would say that most of the businesses are performing well. As I've mentioned, we are right on top of our internal expectations for the year. The area \u2013 really, the big area that we talked about of underperformance would be impact from foreign currency, which is greater than we anticipated it to be. And because we don't issue our numbers on a constant currency basis, we haven't had that benefit.","And then really in our Output Solutions and there is a twofold impact there. The first one is that EMV, while we've had a very large demand and future orders logged, we have not seen the level of production that we had anticipated earlier in the year, that's a matter of timing. The other thing that is \u2013 intricately connected to that is there were, because of the large number of breaches last year, we had a lot of reissue, and we're finding institutions trying to balance out, how do I think about last year's big reissues with the EMV this year. And we're not seeing the number of programs come through that we typically would have \u2013 and we believe that's solely related to these blips and breach timing from last year. So those are the things that we hadn't anticipated, but on balance, we feel like we're making good progress and that we're well-positioned for the second half acceleration that we had planned originally.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. And then, the other question I had is on acquisitions and the acquisition environment. What do you see out there in terms of valuations or attractive properties right now in the marketplace? Thank you, Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks Bryan. So we've been pretty disciplined and how we think about our capital and how we allocate that capital. There are a lot of attractive properties out there, lots of payments properties that are out there, but valuations are high and on that basis when we think about acquisitions, we want to make sure that we're doing things that are strategic, that are going to be accretive to the value that we deliver to our clients as well as our internal revenue growth rate and that they're going to generate sustainable and attractive streams of free cash flow. So, we evaluate lots of things, we don't pull the trigger that much and I think we'll continue to be wired in \u2013 wired in that way.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our last question comes from Mr. Brett Huff of Stephens Incorporated. Sir, your line is now open.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Brett.","Thomas Jeffrey Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary","Hi, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Just one question, we talked a little bit about Agiliti in the UK challenger banks. Can you give us an update on that? And from Investor Day, that was something that piqued my interest, and seems like there might be a bigger pot of gold at the end of that rainbow than maybe we saw it originally. How is that progressing, and what you're kind of take so far in the last few months?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's \u2013 thanks Brett, it's progressing well. We continue to add new names into our pipeline, we continue to build like crazy, we are doing a lot of work to get built, and we expect to go live with our first client towards the end of Q4, beginning of Q1. We expect to sign at least a couple of clients in this quarter, and I think you will continue to see us start to announce some names moving forward.","We've been pretty circumspect with the new clients to make sure that we can absolutely deliver on what the clients need when they need it, we think it's really important that these new challenger banks get started in the right way. But the thing that's really been different, Brett, than we had originally anticipated is there are lots and lots of names in our pipeline that are not challenger bank names, and that's what makes this opportunity much larger than we anticipated. And that is working quite well and we're again, I keep saying this, we're really bullish on that opportunity as well.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. That's all I need. I appreciate it.","Jeffery W.

Invitations will be sent this fall. In the meanwhile, please contact our Investor Relations team for additional information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strong results for the quarter are consistent with our plan, which anticipated an acceleration of revenue and earnings throughout the year. New business is coming online as expected, and we have good visibility to the remainder of the year. We're on track to achieve our full year financial objectives.","Adjusted revenue increased 12% in the quarter and is up 9% year-to-date. Adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated slightly more than anticipated to 4% in the quarter. We achieved 7% internal revenue growth in our Payments segment, which was the highest level since the first quarter of 2008.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 110 basis points to 30.5%, and was up 210 basis points sequentially. Operating margin benefited from revenue growth in our scale businesses, favorable mix and strong Operational Effectiveness results. Overall, adjusted operating margin is up 50 basis points through June 30.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.50 in the quarter and up 16% to $2.83 through June 30. Free cash flow per share grew 26% to $2.67 through the first half of the year. This excludes $116 million of a distribution received from our StoneRiver joint venture in the quarter.","Growing market momentum is visible in our results. Sales in the quarter, excluding Open Solutions, were on track at 102% of quota. For the 6-month period, actual sales were up 9% versus the prior year, which is better than the headline given that last year's second quarter included the TD Bank bill payment sale, which was one of our largest transactions ever.","At the start of the year, we shared 3 key enterprise priorities to help you gauge our progress. First, to continue to build high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to extend market momentum into deeper client relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And last, to deliver innovation and integration to enhance results for our clients with an important focus on Open Solutions.","We progressed well against our first priority in the quarter. Growth stemmed from a number of areas across the company, including the on-boarding of large bill payment wins, Online Banking transformations, accelerating growth in mobile and solid performance in our debit, payments and account processing businesses. The quality of our new revenue is apparent as adjusted operating income grew 16% in the quarter and is up 10% year-to-date, both on the strength of expanding margins and the Open Solutions acquisition. These results translated to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth in the quarter.","Our second priority is to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions, such as our market-leading payments and digital channels offerings. We signed 98 new Mobiliti clients in the quarter and 188 year-to-date, which brings the total number of mobile clients to nearly 1,600.","Mobiliti ASP subscribers have more than tripled in the last 12 months, and were up 23% sequentially. Financial institutions are focused on offering unique, mobile banking experiences to better serve their customers.","We expanded the Popmoney Instant Payments program in the quarter as our realtime payment offerings begin to take hold. During the quarter, we announced that PNC Bank would offer Popmoney Instant Payments. And we also expanded our realtime reach by adding the STAR debit network. Since then, we've signed several additional Popmoney Instant Payments clients that should also go live later this year. Lastly, we signed 71 new bill payment clients in the quarter.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration for our clients with a focus on Open Solutions. Late in the second quarter, we introduced our ASP version of tablet banking, which enables financial institutions to provide a differentiated experience to any of the more than 50 million tablet owners in the U.S. This new solution is currently available to the more than 1,200 financial institutions on our Mobiliti ASP solution.","Among a number of sales wins in the quarter, we signed Investors Bank, headquartered in Short Hills, New Jersey with over $12 billion in assets. This fast-growing bank will utilize a signature account processing platform as part of a broad suite of integrated Fiserv solutions.","The integration of Open Solutions continues to go quite well. We closed 5 new DNA sales in the quarter and have as many DNA transactions closed through June 30 as were completed in all of 2012. The DNA pipeline is building rapidly, and we project great sales for the foreseeable future.","We're steadily integrating our leading surround solutions for the Open account processing client base. Bill payment, card, online banking and mobile are currently the most sought-after solutions. To date, we've gained more traction than we expected on our revenue synergy objectives. We're also making excellent progress against our expense synergy goals, as indicated by our strong first half Operational Effectiveness results. We now expect to exceed our original expense and revenue synergy goals for the Open acquisition of $50 million and $75 million, respectively.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional details for the quarter.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 12% in the second quarter to $1.1 billion, and increased 9% in the first 6 months to $2.2 billion compared to the prior year periods. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% in the second quarter and is 2% year-to-date. Adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.50 in the quarter and is up 16% to $2.83 through June 30.","Adjusted operating income increased 16% in the quarter to $347 million compared to last year. Adjusted operating margin was 30.5%, an increase of 110 basis points over the prior year's quarter, and up 210 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by strong Operational Effectiveness results, business mix and the high-quality revenue growth in our Payments segment.","For the first 6 months, adjusted operating income was $655 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year, and adjusted operating margin improved 50 basis points to 29.5%.","Now on to the segment results. Adjusted internal revenue in the Payments segment increased 7% to $562 million in the quarter, and increased 4% to $1.1 billion in the first 6 months. Excellent performance in card services, biller and digital channels and acceleration at our bill payment business drove the strong revenue growth.","Bill payment transaction growth, which was boosted by the significant sales wins, accelerated to 7% in the quarter and was up 4 percentage points sequentially. Also, e-bill transactions continued to progress, up 5% year-over-year for the second quarter in a row. Debit transactions in our card business continued to grow well above the market, up 15% in the quarter, 2 percentage points sequentially and up 14% year-to-date. We have also added 74 new debit clients over the first 6 months of the year.","We continued to build the issuer side of the Popmoney network, adding 64 financial institutions in the quarter and 153 year-to-date. We continue to see important opportunities for growth in this space and, in particular, where Popmoney intersects with realtime.","Payments segment operating income was up 14% in the quarter to $179 million and year-to-date operating income increased 10% to $345 million, all of which is organic. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was 32% in the second quarter, an increase of 210 basis points over the prior year and up 150 basis points sequentially. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin for the segment was up 150 basis points to 31.2%. Margin expansion was driven by increased operating leverage in our scale businesses, including card services, bill payment and digital channels, partially offset by the impact of the Bank of America renewal.","Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 18% in the quarter to $590 million and 14% to $1.1 billion for the first 6 months of the year compared with the prior year periods. Adjusted internal revenue accelerated nicely, growing 2% in the quarter compared to the negative 2% reported in the first quarter.","Although the majority of the total revenue gained in the segment was from Open Solutions, internal revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our lending and account processing businesses, along with strong license sales.","Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 17% in the quarter to $191 million and adjusted operating margin declined by 10 basis points to 32.4% compared to the prior year, which is primarily related to the impact of the large account processing client deconversion and the Open Solutions acquisition.","Adjusted operating margin in the segment expanded 260 basis points sequentially, driven primarily by Operational Effectiveness results, including synergies and improved license revenue. Year-to-date adjusted operating income in the segment was up 13% to $356 million and operating margin declined 20 basis points to 31.1%.","The adjusted operating loss in the Corporate segment for the second quarter was $23 million, increasing by $2 million over the second quarter of 2012 and consistent with the first quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was up 70 basis points to 35% over the adjusted prior-year period rate. Through June 30, our adjusted effective tax rate is up 40 basis points to 34.8%. We expect the rate in the second half of the year to be between 36% and 37%.","Free cash flow per share was strong, growing 26% to $2.66 -- $2.67 through June 30, primarily as a result of increased earnings and lower tax payments compared to the prior year.","As Jeff highlighted earlier, we received $122 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture in connection with the recapitalization, of which $116 million is excluded from free cash flow. To date, we have received more than 100% of our original investment back in cash. And we continue to see additional value creation opportunities.","Net interest expense for the quarter was up slightly over the prior year period due to a $6 million investment gain included in last year's second quarter. Total debt at June 30 was just under $4 billion or 2.6x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 2.3 million shares of stock in the quarter for $204 million. And through June 30, have repurchased 3.1 million shares for $271 million. As of quarter's end, there were 131.1 million shares outstanding and 2.4 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Tom. As I mentioned upfront, sales, excluding Open Solutions, were solid in the quarter, attaining 102% of quota and are 94% of year-to-date quota. Actual sales through June 30 were up 9% versus last year, which included the very significant TD Bank bill payment sale in the last year's second quarter. Excluding the TD Bank transaction, sales through June 30 are up 27% year-over-year. Our pipeline remains healthy, and we are optimistic that we will achieve our full year sales target.","Integrated sales were $63 million in the quarter, and are $101 million through the first half of the year versus our $210 million annual target. Payments and Digital Channel Solutions led our performance again this quarter. We're on track to achieve our integrated sales objective for the year.","Our Operational Effectiveness goal for 2013 is $60 million, which includes the anticipated Open Solutions cost synergies. We achieved $32 million of savings or 53% of our annual target in the first 6 months of the year. We've captured some synergy benefits earlier than anticipated, which contributed to our strong first half results. We are well positioned to meet our Operational Effectiveness objective for the year.","The environment continued to be stable in the quarter, with discussion of possible interest rate movement providing a bit more optimism across the market. Regulatory actions continued to be modest, with 16 in the second quarter and only 25 year-to-date, which is down about 30% compared to the same period last year. We're also seeing a gradual pickup of M&A activity in the banking market, which we view as a generally positive environmental sign.","Our view of technology spend has not changed from the first quarter. Financial institutions remain focused on solutions that can help them generate revenue, deal with the complex regulatory environment and create efficiency.","As I've said upfront, our overall results are in line with our expectations, and we're on track to achieve our full year results. We still expect full year adjusted revenue to increase by more than 10% and adjusted internal revenue to grow 3% to 4%, with a slight bias to increased growth later in the year due to the combination of normal year-end seasonality and an easier fourth quarter compare.","We expect adjusted EPS to grow in a range of 15% to 19% or $5.84 to $6.03 per share. We continue to expect operating margin to expand between 10 and 50 basis points for the full year. And finally, we expect free cash flow to increase by at least 18% or greater than $6.55 per share for the full year.","In summary, we feel good as we enter the second half of the year. The on-boarding of larger transactions is progressing well and sales performance is cracking. We continue to make strong progress in the Open Solutions integration, and we're enthusiastic about the significant interest in DNA. Overall, we expect to achieve our 2013 targets and have meaningful momentum as we exit the year.","Our success is attributable to the engagement of more than 21,000 associates who are helping Fiserv clients architect a new financial services experience around the world.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Is the composition of growth that we saw in the quarter, high single-digit payment growth but low single-digit financial, is that the sort of breakdown we should expect for the balance of the year?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think that's reasonable. We are going to have some fluctuations, as you know, David, in the Financial segment as license fees and other factors. But yes, I think that's reasonable from a range standpoint.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then second, Jeff, you highlighted greater-than-expected revenue synergies from the Open deal, can you drill down a little bit into where you're seeing the incremental growth at least above your expectations?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean we -- I would say the increased expectations are taking 2 forms. There is far faster engagement in the process. In other words, we have the client base is quite excited to have the opportunity to basically shop within the financial services technology store that we have. And so whether it's on the debit or credit card side or online banking, mobile, bill payment, those kinds of things, and you have tremendous interest there, as well as in other products that we probably had not prioritized. And that could be anywhere from our multichannel management solutions to our statement -- our custom statement offerings and just lots and lots of interest there, which we think is attributable, not just to, and to the fact that the services weren't there, but also this whole notion of -- specifically around the DNA platform, they bring a more modern technology architecture to bear. And these products, in combination with DNA, really go a long way in crafting this new financial services experience, which we think will be quite important over the next 5 to 10 years.","Thomas J. Hirsch","And I think to add to that, David, I think the sales pipelines that we're seeing in regards to Open and other value content around DNA have built a lot faster than we would have anticipated sitting here back at the start of the year. So that's a very positive sign.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. I appreciate the detail. Just finally, Jeff, you're probably aware a number of your competitors are targeting some of the Open Solutions\/DNA customers. What have you seen in terms of client retention with these customers, particularly in this transition period?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, so we are quite bullish about what we're seeing going on in the existing Open Solutions base. Again, the lion's share, the substantial majority of the synergy value is going to come from existing clients adding on current Fiserv solutions. So the reception has been quite warm. And that doesn't mean that we won't lose a client at some point. I mean that's, unfortunately, part of how the business works. But I'm not currently aware of situations where we have been under attack by clients and have those responses going the wrong way. So on balance, within the DNA base and the total plus base and the Open base overall, we're feeling quite good about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to follow up on David's question around retention. Same thing on Harland -- I guess with the Harland acquisition and D&H taking it over, what's the strategy for potentially going after that account base? What's the implications for Fiserv, that kind of thing?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes. So Tien-Tsin, I mean obviously, we've been competing against that base for a long time. And we -- to some extent, anytime you have a transition, especially a transition like this, it has clients kind of reconsider, \"Is this the right path for us and what does it mean?\" Being that we've done so many acquisitions over the years, we know exactly what that feels like. And we have a pretty good handle on how to compete against that. So on one hand, we think it's good news that you continue to see validation that there's going to be combinations of providers. On the other hand, we think this represents a good opportunity go out and win some incremental business, frankly, none of which has been factored into how we thought about the world, given how new this announcement is.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, fair enough. Then I think you said internal revenue growth accelerated a bit faster than expected. Can we attribute that primarily maybe to the license sales in the Financial segment or was it more than that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean, I think I'll give it a shot and let Tom correct or add where it should be. We did have a good quarter on license revenue in the Financial segment, probably a little bit more than we thought we would have. But as you know, license revenue tends to bounce around. But on the payment side, the 7% payments growth, as you know, that's not license revenue. That's kind of high-quality recurring revenue that we think is going to be pretty sticky moving into the rest of this year and into '14. So from that standpoint, we feel good about the composition of the mix between payments and in the Financial segment, and expect to see the Financial segment continue to do quite well for the remainder of the year.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, great. Last one from me, I promise. Just the backlog converting, is it still on time? It sounds like the on-boarding of large transactions you talked about is being -- is going well, I think is what you said. Is that still the case? Any change there?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","No, I mean we're in good shape. There were a couple of transactions that needed to go live in the month of July. And we're right there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And I guess, first of all, just wondering, how much maybe if we disaggregate the Payments business, how much of that growth came from the new deal signings, the large deal signings? And maybe how much is kind of the underlying growth, excluding that?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So that is a good question. I mean the majority of the growth every year is going to come from the existing base and it's going to come from transactions, new transactions, more of the same kinds of transactions. So you're going to see that every year because, obviously, you're replacing revenue that might have run off in one way or another. For this year, in particular, and we'll see it again next year, we've had, as you know, a number of large clients. So at the margin, right, that's layering on in a way that is quite positive. But we are seeing pretty good growth just in the fundamentals of our different businesses. You can see it in a place like e-bill, for example, right? The second quarter of 5% transaction growth back-to-back after having no 5% quarters last year. Some of that is coming from new bill payment clients, but much of that is coming from new feature function that we've embedded in the product that's creating and enhancing the experience for our bill payment users. We've just put a new release into the market, which is, in fact, helping the bill payment users to have yet again another level of high-quality experience. So we're continuing to tweak and mold our ability to change the adoption patterns, so that's helping as well. And then things like we mentioned, Dave, the tablet ASP offering that we just went live with in the last -- over the last 45 days. We're really excited about how even something like that is looking. So a lot of them are kind of tweaking around and building the pockets of transaction capability within the base combined with those larger -- kind of those larger wins then -- and it's those larger wins that will take us out over multiple periods. And so that gives us some confidence in the momentum that I mentioned going into '14.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great, great. And just one follow up, on the Open deal, it sounds like you're doing a great job on the cost saves side. What year is the biggest impact -- your biggest impacted year from the costs saves. I'm kind of guessing it's probably next year because this year you probably got some solid savings but they've kind of transitioned through the year and next year is maybe the biggest impact?","Thomas J. Hirsch","I think it's really about equal between both. The first 2 years have the majority of the synergy benefit.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Cost.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Cost synergy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to jump in on the bill pay side again. Obviously, the new additions are helping in this quarter's growth. First of all, I know there's more to come. I think you had mentioned last call that towards the end of the year, fourth quarter, there's another sizable deal, is that still on track? And then are there others that are in the pipeline that are similar?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, so as of the first quarter, the end of the first quarter, only one of our larger transactions had gone live. And so now that's fully live and that was TD Bank, as we had mentioned. The remaining larger transactions have just started to go live, in fact, in July. And then we'll have a couple of more go live towards the end of the year. And then the Wells deal will go live in '14. So we're actually pretty early in the live dates of these larger transactions. Now keep in mind, these transactions go on slowly. They don't all jump in any one month. So it'll -- they'll anniversary over, call it, probably they'll feel like a 6-month run-on.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, I was just going to ask about that. So once you actually bring it on -- I mean, obviously, the deal is done and everything is technologically set up to actually operate, but the transition of consumers using the actually product takes time, right? I mean, how long does it actually take do you think it -- until it peaks out?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","It depends on what the bank wants to do because the banks will gate how they want to migrate their users over. Some of them will migrate them over a relatively short period of time, some of them may migrate them over a 3, 4-month period. It really does depend. And then the other element that's important to keep in mind is because, at least we believe our bill payment product is very differentiated, we tend to see when people move over to our product -- we tend to see people transact more, get more utility out of things like e-bill, our risk model and those kinds of benefits to the end user and so there is a level of take-up that happens even in the end users who have been using the product on a more frequent basis. So again, from my own hypothetical, I would say, 6-ish months from the time the last clients start to go live is probably a good way to think about it.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. Just -- so to follow up on that, I mean is there any reason if you have that, the new business that just came on with TD and you have Wells coming on later, is there really any reason to think the Payments segment, which showed acceleration, isn't -- shouldn't accelerate a little further through the rest of this year?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Well, I mean you have -- if that were the only thing in the segment, that would be right. But you have, in the Payments segment, which is roughly a $2 billion revenue segment, you have a variety of different things that can moderate up and down in a quarter. But when we announced in the first quarter, we were very confident that we would see between 4% and 8% growth in the Payments segment for the remainder of the year. And it's hard for me to see how we would have gigantic swings in that just because of the recurring revenue. But I do think there could be some slight, slight swings on the margins that could happen. But on balance, we feel pretty good about where we are, given the performance in the second quarter and our visibility for the remainder of the year.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I could just sneak in one last financial one in before I turn it back to the queue. On the financial -- on the free cash flow side, obviously, it's up pretty well year-to-date. Yet you're calling still for about I think 18% you said? Year-over-year growth is $6.55 plus for the year. What is the dynamic? I mean, obviously, it can be lumpy, but what's the dynamic in the second half of the year that would bring it down versus the first half?","Thomas J. Hirsch","There's a lot of changes that go on. I mean clearly we still need a strong second half, and we anticipate that. Generally, our second half free cash flow is fairly strong. If you look at last year, we generated roughly about $470 million of free cash flow in the second half of the year. So there's a lot of variability that impacts working capital, but our guidance is very strong from a standpoint of 18% increase in greater than -- from a free cash flow per share standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just going back to the payments results themselves, the organic growth that you showed there. I'm trying to get my arms around just the thought about how much of it is now a function of the -- kind of the integrated approach that you guys take. So are you seeing an uptick because your mobile platform, your P2P platform and your bill payment platform, if you will, all come into the market at the same time in a more integrated fashion and finally, are getting more -- resonating either better with the FI clients or with the consumers. I'm just trying to get my arms around the driver itself and how much having sort of the integrated pieces now in front of you guys should be adding to the growth profile overall.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean clearly, we have seen over the last couple of years, we've seen more than 100% growth in the mobile channel for something like bill payment. So I mean, I do believe the channel access, how we've gotten the products integrated are clearly contributing to the growth that we're seeing in the market or in the product, in the bill payment product. We, obviously, have P2P, which I think had 84%, 85%-ish growth. Obviously, that's on a small transaction base. But as you know, Julio, over time, right, that's going to grow and we fundamentally believe that space is conceptually as big as bill pay, if not bigger. Now that will take years to get there, but you've got that -- you've got a variety of different factors that are adding in to driving. You've got the continuing push on debit, the number of client wins that we're having. And we also are having kind of -- remember, in our Payments segment, we have our channels business and so we're seeing a lot of growth. I think the number of subscribers through our ASP mobile solution is up 3x over where it was last year. So -- and those people we are exposing, P2P and bill payment and mobile capture and those kinds of technologies, all of which are driving transactions in the Payments segment. So yes, we think we have an embedded advantage due to the integration. We also think people are actually still figuring it out -- how they're going to operate there. So all of that is conspiring to help us along with these big -- the bigger clients that we have won over the last few years.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I think that really does change a little bit the dynamic that in some ways where, historically, we would be looking at something like, is debit volume growing and how do we think about that tracing back. So for you guys, if these smaller areas are the ones -- you, obviously, revenue contributions are relatively small but if they continue to ramp then some of those metrics, I guess, would be the ones that we see, at least publicly, would be probably a little bit less relevant. Would you sort of agree that maybe thinking about what mobile volume could be doing and what P2P could be doing in some of these other -- even some of the mobile capture components could mean to overall growth kind of longer-term as well?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean, I do think the lag effect, right? Even think about take -- jump on to your debit example for a minute. I mean we're still growing somewhere between 300 and 500 basis points faster than the market because of that lag right into the 6,000 community-oriented, call it, the $30 billion and less banks, right? So we are the -- we're going to, we think, continue to be the beneficiary because you've got more ramp-up going on in that space and we're winning at a much higher rate than most. So I would expect that exact phenomena to exist. We've seen it in the bill payment area, right? So our bill payment transactions in the smaller end of the market are growing very, very fast relative to the overall market. And so we would expect to see that in all of these different spaces with the exception of P2P. Because we really are the financial institution-centric market leader, we would probably lead the market there as opposed to lag.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just last, any major efforts or thoughts around ACH as an alternative, especially in the mobile world where merchants seem to be very focused on the arbitrage, a way of interchange. Do you guys sort of see that as being a credible alternative that merchants would actually want to move more aggressively on especially as they consider some of the digital wallet offerings that might be out there, tying it back more directly to ACH.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, so we are doing a lot of work. As you probably know, Julio, we own PEP+, right, so kind of the ACH standard across the U.S. We're doing a lot of work now and it really developed, we think, leading technology in that area that will allow financial institutions to move ACH as we kind of work through the risk side of it, move ACH on a realtime basis. So as that moves into the market, I do think there are opportunities there. From our perspective, we're probably more focused on the financial institution side. We view ourselves as being very issuer-centric and therefore, that's really where our focus is. But we are, obviously, paying a lot of attention on what's going on in the market, with merchants and, frankly, the battle that's occurring between issuers and merchants. So we do think ACH -- in fact, we're very confident ACH will play a role in there. It's just what does that role look like and how does that evolve? Eric mentioned Investor Day -- I actually think this is one of the areas that we'll want to talk about at Investor Day because we do think the whole notion of realtime, as we laid out a couple of years ago, as it's evolving and how the pieces come together, we think we're very well positioned to take advantage of those new opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I have sort of a question on just general monetization updates of some of your growth products, and most of my questions have been answered but I just want to ask, can you just give us updated thoughts on how the monetization, not necessarily the penetration, but the monetization of Mobiliti happens? And also how the peer-to-peer, kind of what are those business models evolving as your FI partners?","Mark A. Ernst","Yes, Brett, this is Mark Ernst. I'll try to cover some of that. Fundamentally, we have a model that principally pays us based on consumer adoption. So as we get a little bit of fee for people -- from financial institutions as they bring both those products into their portfolio of offerings, but for the most part, we are partners with our financial institution clients as they bring -- as they get more consumer penetration into those offerings. We, through our ASP and our pricing as an ASP, we benefit alongside of them. So as those things get more penetration over time, we think that we will see nice growth in revenues to go along with it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, and I think the other aspect of that is how these services end up getting priced at the financial institution market. So right now, we see some financial institutions who are charging for mobile capture. We know financial institutions will charge for realtime P2P. We see that there are opportunities potentially to actually have financial institutions charge for mobile capture with realtime or immediate funds availability. So there are a variety of derivatives that are going on out there. And to the extent that our products and services are best aligned with the economic incentives, i.e. revenue and earnings at the financial institution level, I think we'll see a much larger push, as Mark said on the consumer adoption -- a consumer adoption element of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","First, just a couple of number questions and, Tom, you may have alluded to this but could you talk a little bit a little more color on the payments margin strength? And sort of the -- in the context of -- part of it, I'm sure, is the revenue growth, but the incremental profits were even higher than your incremental revenue from a Q-to-Q perspective. So just looking if there was -- just for a better explanation for why that margin strength both Q-to-Q and year-over-year?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think the drop through, especially on a year-over-year basis, was very strong. But I think, Glenn, it's really the high-quality revenue growth that we've been talking about strategically for a number of different years, for the last couple of years and that coming to fruition. We have very strong businesses of scale, both in card services, which is our debit processing business, our bill pay business, et cetera. And it's really a culmination of those from that standpoint. As you know, our Operational Effectiveness initiatives continued to be strong, and that's really the primary drivers.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I would say the other thing is, we've been making fairly sizable investments in our channels businesses with specifically in something like mobile ASP. And as those revenues come on, we have the opportunity to recoup the investments that we make in prior years. And so again, even -- not just the scale businesses, but we would still view mobile as a subscale business, but that's really on an absolute basis, not on an incremental basis.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just, Tom, on the financial side, the uptick on the organic was partly you said year-over-year's license revenue growth? Any way you could help us directionally quantify that either the increase in the license revenue or how much it contributed to the organic revenue growth?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, excluding Open Solutions, so on the Financial segment, license revenue in the quarter was up about $9 million, which is roughly about a 2% positive impact on organic growth in the Financial segment in the quarter. And it didn't really impact the Payments segment because, as Jeff highlighted earlier, most of that is recurring revenue.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a clarification, you said that you had 5, I think you said the 5 DNA sales wins in the quarter. Were those competitive takeaways? Just want to be clear on that.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","There were some competitive takeaways, and there were some kind of within the Fiserv family moving -- making a choice to move to the DNA platform.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes. And Glenn, just one more note on the license fees, on a year-to-date basis, it's about flat compared to the prior year, up a couple of million dollars. Just so you have that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Fidyk with Findlay Park.","Chris Fidyk","Very quickly, is it possible for you to talk about the tax benefits that you may realize from the Open Solutions acquisition? Are you realizing them? If you are not, when will you? And is it possible to sort of quantify what they might be next year? And the second one is I'm not sure you mentioned this, but are you sort of at a comfortable leverage ratio at this point in time? You, obviously, repurchased a lot stock. I just want to understand where you are from kind of a credit rating point of view.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, Chris, I'll take that. So I think from a -- the NOL that we acquired in conjunction with the Open Solutions acquisition, that deferred tax asset is going to roll in over the -- and we're getting that benefit right now. But that's going to be rolling in pretty consistently over the next 4 to 5 years. And so that benefit is rolled kind of into our cash flow. It does not go through our income statement because it's set up in purchase accounting. So we'll continue to see that. It's rolled in right now, and it will continue to be in here for about the next 5 to 6 years on a pretty consistent basis. And so that is -- that's from that standpoint. And your second question again?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Leverage.","Thomas J. Hirsch","On the leverage side, we're at about 2.6x, and our target is between 2 and 2.5. And we've typically been at a little bit of the higher end of that range. So we'll continue to allocate our capital. As you know, we bought back more stock in the second quarter, share repurchase is our capital allocation benchmark. Then we'll pay down a little bit more debt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","On the strong sales performance this quarter, have you guys made any adjustments to your sales strategy or your organization? Or is it really just more reflective of a pretty robust sort of end demand environment?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","It is. I mean a few years ago, we actually made a pretty large change to our organization structure of moving our sales organization -- moving into a single sales organization with very, obviously, very strong tiebacks to the businesses. And I think we're getting -- we're seeing some of those benefits. We've begun to see those benefits over the last couple of years, and I think that, that will continue. But I think the lion's share of it is around the fact that we have a really great sales force that's out there, knocking on doors and really pushing the value that we've created, the unique value propositions around integration and innovation, and they're doing a great job selling the products that our businesses has built. So, and I guess it would be demand and personal stick-to-it-iveness.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. So another question on the Popmoney realtime, I know that it's not rolled out widely. I know you mentioned PNC only. But any super preliminary read on consumer uptake or consumer usage of the realtime versus the non-realtime? Has that kind of -- has what you've seen far matched up with your expectations?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, unfortunately, even PNC won't be live until later in the year, I think in the beginning of the fourth quarter. So we don't have -- beyond research, we don't have any real live in-market proof points yet. But we are pretty bullish about how the P2P experience changes when you integrate realtime. But we'll be able to talk about that in more detail come first quarter of '14.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then one last one. It seems like the electronic bill pay, the kind of central competitive matchup is really between kind of consolidated bill pay, like a model like yours versus a direct model where you can go to a merchant website or a mobile app or other channels where a consumer can pay directly. And I think the direct version is -- represents the majority of the market at this point. How do you go about capturing more share from the direct billers? And I guess what impact do you think mobile will have on that consolidated versus direct kind of competitive landscape?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Sure. From a perspective of market, as I recall, it's about 50-50. It might be 51, 49, it kind of shifts sometimes as between consolidator and biller direct. There is, I think most importantly, whether it's biller direct or consolidator, as a model, the lion's share, the substantial majority of bills are still not electronic. So there's a lot of room to grow on both sides of that value proposition. From our perspective, I actually think mobile will go a long way. The mobile and the combination of mobile and P2P will go a long way into bringing a large cross-section of consumers into the electronic bill payment consolidator space that we have not had access to historically. And so we're pretty excited about how that product will roll out. And as we've shared before, we have been in a place where P2P, the majority of P2P right now is actually not person-to-person transactions per se. It is, in fact, for a different subset of consumers to pay their bills electronically. So it tells me that there is a -- still a lot of runway on the consolidator side. Just one last point I would make, I mean as it relates to the Fiserv business, we have a very large business where we actually facilitate biller direct payments. Biller direct -- so we host those payment services across many of the larger billers in the U.S. today. And that allows us to, not only have access to the non-consolidator side of the market as it relates to the payment itself, but also very importantly, to distribute that bill back into the consolidator population for the nearly half of the population who prefers to pay in that fashion. Fundamentally, we believe that payments are a reflex action to some kind of a request for money. And so we're very focused on what are those different ways we can aggregate all of those requests and drop them into the consolidator site so that you can make it easy to pay bills in that fashion. We think one of the value propositions that drives biller direct is that you don't have to know how much you owe to go pay it. So how can we bring that content, make it available at the consolidator, we think, is a really interesting strategic question, probably not one that we can finish in the next couple of minutes, but it's pretty -- it's a great question and we think we're -- we're very excited about the opportunities because of where we play in that landscape.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I may have missed this, apologize if I did. But you guys said you'd exceed the $50 million and $75 million synergy targets. I may missed where you would go to with the synergy targets.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","You didn't miss it because we haven't yet published it. We're still working on it. We're highly confident that we're going to be above, and we expect at Investor Day we'll give an update on where we are with Open Solutions, including our new cuts at the synergies.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got it. And I guess one question on Acumen. When you had Acumen and you were successful selling it to the market but the implementations were kind of really spread out for a couple of years. And now as you transition some of these clients to DNA, is there a near-term revenue pull-in opportunity? Is that happening in terms of the implementations coming in -- happening faster? So maybe there was a 2014, late 2014 revenue that gets pulled into 2013 or something like that?","Mark A. Ernst","There's not -- this is Mark Ernst. So there's not a lot of big -- a lot of impact on 2013. There's -- we are working hard within Open, the Open organization to kind of build out the -- integrate the implementation teams to take on what we both can see and expect will be a continued acceleration in DNA sales. We have been working really hard in building out that capability. That may lead to some incremental kind of revenue pull-in in 2014 and 2015 that we might have seen otherwise with Acumen. But that will probably be more than offset by the acceleration that we're seeing in sales interest in DNA overall.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it, okay, okay. Just to kind of -- a couple of numbers questions. As I think of 3Q versus 4Q, should we expect that to be a little bit more back-end loaded than usual because you have these ramps coming up?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","I don't know that I would say more back-end loaded than usual. I think our take for where we can see things right now is we had a little bit of incremental benefit in the second quarter, as Tom referenced, around some of the license revenue and the Financial segment at least as we might project out. And then in the fourth quarter last year, we always -- or the fourth quarter every year, Ashwin, as you know, have seasonality in a couple of our businesses, and we had a pretty easy compare, right? The third quarter, the organic revenue growth in the last year's Q3 was much better than it was in Q4. So on a comparative basis, I think you've got those drivers. But again, as we talked about earlier, if you're thinking a little bit more about the Payments segment, we do think that will continue to see ramping to your point.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And last question [indiscernible]. Tom, could you remind us of the sensitivity to interest rate in [indiscernible]. I think there may be in the CheckFree business?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, we're pretty well -- I mean we're -- we don't have a lot of float revenue income today. And so clearly, we have a portfolio there that's not earning a lot from that standpoint. So that's upside over the next several years to the extent we have interest rates that get back to normal levels.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Any way to quantify that?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Right now, I think I don't want to do that at this point in time. But I think initially, when we purchased CheckFree, I think they were probably -- had around $40 million of kind of float income at that particular time.","Operator","Our last question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So first, just a cleanup question. What were the term fees in the quarter?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Term fees overall, excluding Open Solutions, they were flat with the prior quarter. And actually, on a year-to-date basis, they're actually down about $5 million. So it was a negative impact to internal revenue growth on a year-to-date basis.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, got you. And then I wanted to clarify on the commentary around a slight bias towards Q4. So you're talking about both internal revenue growth that the rate and adjusted earnings being -- showing [ph] improvement from here into Q3 and then also into Q4?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","We were really talking about internal revenue growth.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Internal revenue growth, okay. And then last one, Jeff, I know in the prepared remarks you talked about expectations around tech spending not really changing despite the environment in interest rates at least at the long end of the curve somewhat improving here. So recognizing we've only been in this new environment for a couple of months, just curious what you think will be the tipping point towards FIs maybe willing up to open their wallets a little bit more going forward?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, I mean I think -- I do think -- I mean, tech spend is probably, this year, will end up being somewhere between 30% and 40% of what it was in 2007 on kind of average level of growth per year. And I think -- I don't believe that it's necessarily sustainable, and I think there has been a lot of people have not been spending. So I do think we'll see it increase. But there is, I think, little possibility that people will allow tech spend to get ahead of what actually happens around rates and how that -- those rates actually translate to more net income for the financial institutions. I think they're going to -- I think people are going to sit on the sidelines a bit. Yes, they're going to feel more optimistic, but I don't think anyone is going to spend ahead of seeing what falls through to the bottom line. But that said, it's -- the market is far more optimistic right now than they were at the same time last year. You may remember last year that people started out strong and really fell off a cliff a bit. We're not seeing that, and that's why my commentary was really about Q1 outlook to Q2 outlook just in terms of, call it, a temperature index as opposed to anything else.","All right, thank you. And thanks, everyone, for joining us. We obvious -- always appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect at this time."],"9598":["Fiserv, Inc.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. You may begin.","Paul Seamon - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout the call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons.","Lastly, given the strategic and contextual discussion at our June 20 Investor Day, our prepared remarks for this quarter are a bit shorter than usual.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid financial results in the quarter consistent with our expectations given our stronger-than-expected Q1. Our performance for the first half of the year is right in line with expectations, and we expect to achieve our full-year financial objectives.","Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter and 4% for the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points for the quarter and adjusted earnings per share grew 10%, both of which included a large write-off in the quarter. Free cash flow to June 30 was stellar, up 26% for the period. Market momentum continued to build with sales results up 13% sequentially and up 10% through June 30. We have a strong pipeline entering the second half of the year and expect to achieve our full-year sales targets.","Now let me provide an update on our three key shareholder priorities for 2017 which are; first, continue to build high-quality revenue, while meeting our earnings commitments; second, enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continued to focus on high-quality revenue, which we define as long-term and recurring with attractive margin characteristics and high free cash flow conversion. Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter, which we highlighted on our last quarterly call would likely be lower than Q1, led by lending solutions, card services and investment services.","Internal revenue growth was consistent with our expectations at 4% in the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 10 basis points, and is up 40 basis points for the year-to-date. These results include $15 million of unusual expenses in the quarter, which Bob will discuss in a few minutes. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was up 10%, which includes the $0.05 of additional expense I just referenced. Adjusted EPS for the first half of the year was up 14%, and our continued focus on free cash flow delivered 26% growth through June 30. Again, we're on track to meet our financial commitments for the year.","Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. At our Investor Conference, we spoke to the importance of digital and the account processing decision process. During the quarter, we signed Dime Community Bank, a $6 billion asset institution to a new technology stack led by DNA and a full digital suite, including Commercial Center and Architect, along with other security and payments products to enhance customer value.","Our newly acquired digital solutions have meaningfully enhanced our value proposition, leading to pipeline growth, increased sales and market momentum. We signed six new DNA account processing clients in the quarter, including four with assets greater than $1 billion. We're also seeing growing momentum in the large end of the credit union market, as these institutions appear to be even more focused on exploring modern technology and value-added bundles. We had six DNA clients go live in the quarter and expect at least 10 more this year.","We crossed the 6 million mark for Mobiliti ASP subscribers in the quarter, representing nearly 30% growth over the prior year and 7% sequentially. Mobiliti business has also continued to expand, as we have almost 300 live clients with subscribers growing 17% sequentially and more than doubling as of June 30.","We continue to invest in digitally-oriented technologies, including the announcement of a recommended cash offer to acquire Monitise in the quarter, which we expect will enhance our footprint, accelerate digital time-to-market, and provide additional flexibility for our clients. We remain bullish on the role of digital differentiation in our overarching value proposition.","Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. As you know, Zelle launched nationwide in June with Fiserv clients composing nearly 40% of the launch group. The demand for Fiserv to power Zelle for the broad market continues, resulted in signings of three additional top 25 banks in the quarter. We believe that Popmoney and Zelle are key as consumers adopt bank-based P2P as their preferred way to move money.","Three of our newer products were recognized for innovation in the quarter by the Retail Banker International Awards. Immediate Funds and Agiliti were named as finalists for the Product Innovation of the Year and Verifast, our palm-based biometric solution, was named the Security Innovation of the Year and was also a finalist for best consumer focused product. Well-placed innovation drives client value, builds differentiation, and supports high-quality revenue growth.","We continue to pursue our multi-pronged approach to securing innovation, build, buy and partner. As you saw earlier today, we announced the acquisition of PCLender. Their solution provides enhanced end-to-end retail loan origination capabilities and better positions us to serve our clients' customers when and where they want it. PCLender is already integrated into most of our larger account processing platforms, which will allow us to hit the ground running.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 2% to $1.3 billion, and increased 4% to $2.6 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter and was 4% year-to-date, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures such as the sale of the Australian Item Processing Business which closed in Q2.","As we shared in our Q1 call, we expected our second quarter internal revenue growth rate to be lower than the first quarter, due primarily to timing between periods. The 4% internal growth rate for the first half of the year is consistent with our expectations.","Adjusted operating income in the quarter, which includes the unusual expense items Jeff mentioned up front, increased 3% to $424 million and is up 5% year-to-date to $853 million. Adjusted operating margin was up 10 basis points to 32.0% in the quarter and increased 40 basis points for the first half of the year to 32.3%.","The $15 million charge in the quarter was in the Payments segment and was for two separate projects which had been in process for the last year or so. Included in that total is a $10 million non-cash impairment of previously capitalized development costs, which were written off upon the termination of the projects. Unfortunately, developing innovative solutions can occasionally lead to projects that may not come to fruition.","With that said, we have a strong track record of success, and will continue to identify opportunities to invest in market-leading innovation. The impact of the $15 million expense item on the company is about 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin headwind in the quarter, 60 basis points year-to-date and $0.05 of adjusted earnings per share. But for this, adjusted operating margin in the quarter would have expanded 130 basis points and adjusted EPS would have increased by 15% on the strength of high-quality revenue growth combined with continued outstanding performance against our operational efficiency initiatives.","Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 10% to $1.19 and was up 14% for the first half of the year to $2.43. We believe we are well positioned to achieve our 32nd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.","Our Payments segment adjusted revenue was $716 million in the quarter and $1.4 million for the first six months of the year. Internal revenue growth grew 3% in the quarter, and is up 4% in the first half of the year. The segment performance was led by strong results in card services and investment services. The lower growth rate in the sequential quarter is primarily related to EMV, and we saw a strong EMV implementation ramp in 2016 and while absolute growth continues in 2017, the rate of growth is lower following the initial wave of EMV issuance.","Payments and digital continues to drive value for our clients and their customers and along those lines, we experienced high single-digit debit volume growth and P2P transactions were up over 20% in the quarter. Mobiliti ASP subscribers also performed well in the period, expanding by nearly 30%. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we expect strong mobile adoption for the foreseeable future.","Payments segment adjusted operating income in the quarter was up slightly from the prior year at $239 million and is up 8% to $499 million for the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin was down 100 basis points in the quarter to 33.3%. The write-offs I mentioned a few moments ago compressed the segment margin by 210 basis points in the quarter.","Stated differently, adjusted operating margin would have been up 110 basis points without the charge. And for the first half of the year, adjusted operating margin was up 80 basis points to 34.7%, which is the highest first half adjusted operating margin ever achieved in the Payments segment.","Turning to the Financial segment, adjusted revenue was $623 million in the quarter and $1.2 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 3% for both the quarter and year-to-date versus 1% internal growth in the comparable quarter and comparable prior year. Internal revenue growth was led by our lending solutions and account processing businesses.","Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $214 million for the quarter and was $410 million for the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points to 34.3% in the quarter on the strength of better top line results and favorable expense management. In Q1, we referenced that the timing of expenses had pressured the segment margin, which moderated as expected. For the first half of the year, adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 20 basis points to 33.0%.","Corporate and Other results in the quarter was generally in line sequentially and with the prior year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%, which was consistent with our expectations, including the excess tax benefit of share-based compensation. And we continue to expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be slightly below 33%, which assumes a higher rate in the second half of the year due to the timing of the tax benefits.","Our free cash flow for the first half of the year was excellent at $555 million, an increase of 26% compared to prior year. Free cash flow conversion, which is free cash flow divided by adjusted net income, is our replacement cash flow guidance measure described at Investor Day and was 105% for the first half of the year.","As a reminder, in connection with the SEC comment letter, we agreed to stop reporting free cash flow per share. And we've provided a full reconciliation of free cash flow conversation on page 14 of the supplemental materials, including the GAAP to non-GAAP details, as well as highlighted weighted average share counts for the applicable time periods.","Total debt outstanding was $4.7 billion as of June 30 or 2.3 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock in the quarter for $295 million, and through June 30 we had returned $684 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 5.9 million shares. There were 210.8 (sic) [217.8] million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter and 14.6 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Sales in the second quarter were down 3% due to the timing of prior resales and up 10% for the first half of the year. Quota attainment, which reflects our expectations of increased performance, came in at 82%. Our domestic pipeline was up 20% through June 30, and was up 11% sequentially. We fully expect to achieve our full-year sales target. Integrated sales were $67 million in the quarter, driven primarily by payments and digital solutions. We expect to see a further build of our integrated sales result, as the Biller Solutions strategy shared at Investor Day gains traction.","Our ability to extend client relationships through add-on solutions remains a critical element of our strategy. We had another excellent quarter for operational effectiveness with results coming in at $20 million. Savings were led by workforce optimization, procurement and data center consolidation. Through the midpoint of the year, we are well ahead of plan at $40 million. We fully expect to exceed our operational effectiveness goal of $60 million for the full year.","Payment speed and solution proliferation continue to grab many of the industry headlines, which we discussed in depth at our Investor Day. The combined impact of rising expectations, digital ubiquity and payment speed is changing the way people approach financial services and meaningfully impacting the size and shape of fintech. More recently, we're pleased to see more approvals of de novo bank charters, which creates new opportunities for market participants.","We remain fully committed to our full-year financial objectives. We continue to expect 2017 internal revenue growth of 4% to 5%, and anticipate a higher revenue growth exit rate going into 2018. We expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $5.03 to $5.17 and that adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points.","Finally, we expect our new cash flow metric, free cash flow conversion, to be in a range of 108% to 111% of adjusted net income for the year. We're positioned well going into the second half of the year. We're on pace to meet our financial commitments and are investing organically and via acquisitions to ensure your company is driving accelerated revenue growth, strong operating margins, and excellent free cash flow for years to come. Our success is a product of the more than 23,000 associates who display commitment, dedication, and excellence for clients and shareholders each and every day.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the acceleration in the second half. Can you kind of list through the drivers there, talk about your general confidence level that we're going to see, the expected acceleration?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Ramsey. So, I'll take it and Bob and Mark can add in as needed. I would say \u2013 I guess I would say, first of all, we're confident that we're going to see the acceleration and it's really five or six items and I'll just tick through them. First is, remember we had quite strong sales last year in the second half of the year, and we expect that along with the Fast Start program we had in Q1 to make a contribution in the second half of the year.","Second, and really a derivative of that is the larger implementations that we have been talking about will come online kind of towards the end of the third, fourth quarter. And that includes the 10 DNA transactions that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. As we shared at Investor Day, we're going to have some early biller strategy contributions from some of the bundled value propositions which will come online in Q4 and ramp through 2018, so we're excited about that.","We have some contributions coming from acquisitions as they go from exclusion to being organic. And most of that'll probably be an 2018 event, but we'll see a little bit in 2017. P2P, as we've been talking about, a combination of many of the implementations, I mentioned three of the top 25 that we signed to convert and add in, in Q2. So, we expect to have those implementations and then some processing continuing to build throughout the year and again into 2018. And we expect all of that to lead to a pretty strong exit rate as we move into 2018.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","And that's tremendously helpful. Thank you. And then on the EMV headwind that you called out or the tough year-over-year compare, what's the cadence of that last year? When should we start to see that really abating?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Well, so we're still seeing absolute growth, it's just the growth contribution itself is down a bit and I don't think we're going to see an abatement. I think we're now at a level that we'll see over the next few quarters and we won't really see that abate until we're at the point where we start to see a new contactless cycle and I think we're well away from that.","So, I think we're starting to see, we're kind of moving into this normal level of EMV issuance, but what I would say is we'll expect to see continuing uplift in debit processing as the unlocking of the EMV chip adds revenue. So, as more and more EMV comes online, we'll see an uplift in our processing revenues, but that will be slowly as the cards themselves move into circulation and utilization.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. I'll leave it there and hop back in the queue. Thanks, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Ramsey.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Koning from Baird. Your line is open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Dave?","Operator","Let me check Dave's lines. One moment, please. Dave, your...","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Perhaps we'll go to the next caller.","Operator","I'm sorry, Dave.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Put Dave in next.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Can you guys hear me?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Dave. Yes.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Oh, yeah. All right. Great, thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Good.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And I guess to follow up on the last question just a little bit. I guess in the Payments segment specifically, it's often in Q2 kind of flat to up $20 million or so sequentially and this year it was down $4 million. So, it almost feels like there \u2013 was there anything else other than EMV, because I know you said EMV is not really a downdraft, it's more stable. I'm just wondering if there was either weak term fees or license or anything else that contributed a little, too.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. No, it's good question, Dave. So, we had obviously the EMV that we talked about and we talked about this a little bit in Q1, we had some periodic revenue last year that we saw in Q2 that we got in Q1 this year. The other thing I would say is last year we were 6% in Q2, 7% in the first half of the year in Payments. So, the compare was a little bit tougher, a lot of that buoyed by EMV, but we're still really bullish about the growth in the segment and we expect that to be the big driver of acceleration in the second half of the year.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you. Yeah, that totally makes sense. And the second thing, I mean the acquisitions coming out, I mean that's pretty exciting, Monitise and PCLender. What's the timing or should we just think of that as kind of a end of Q3 type event and maybe what rough revenue should we expect?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, PCLender is actually announced and closed. So, that is now \u2013 the PCLender folks are part of the family. So, we're excited to have them in here. PCLender is a fairly small business. Dave, you made a notation in your note. I would say that I don't expect that to have any meaningful impact, obviously it's not organic revenue until we anniversary. We bought that primarily because they've got some really good people and they've got a really good origination solution and with people moving to digital, we see the importance of origination technologies merging with the digital experiences. And so that's something that we'd been looking to add in for the last, oh, I would say, 12 to 24 months, so we're happy to have that in the family.","Monitise, which we made a recommended cash offer to their shareholders, we had said all along that we thought that transaction was likely a Q3 type transaction and that's still our current belief.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Jeff, you called out strength in the large credit union market growing momentum and congrats on the Dime win. Could you give us maybe a little bit more color on what's driving that strength and is this more kind of outsourcing, competitive takeaways?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. So, David, I was really talking about competitive takeaways, we're seeing more and more activity in the larger credit union space. As you know, D+H had a transaction earlier this year and typically when those transactions occur, it tends to have people take a look at their provider and we're seeing that going on.","And what's interesting to us is that we're seeing, especially in bake-offs where it's not our client today. We're seeing the participants, the credit unions really wanting the newer technology. And so, as you know well, that is the forte of DNA. There are a couple of other small providers out there, who are offering the newer, modern architecture and there between us and those types of providers, we're seeing more decisions going in that direction. So, for us, we're excited given how locked up that space had been for the last several years.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. That's helpful. And then you called out the outperformance on operational effectiveness, it looks like you're two-thirds of the way through the $60 million target at the midpoint of the year. What are the major drivers of outperformance on cost takeout?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","So, David, it's Bob. I would really point to actually the three things that Jeff mentioned in his opening comments. Workforce optimization has certainly been a key driver. That's been part of the acceleration or the bigger savings that we saw versus the first half of last year. We continue to see good progress in our procurement space, as well as data center optimization beginning to really take hold. So, certainly pleased with the progress in the first half of the year and, as Jeff said, at this point we expect to overdrive or overachieve against the $60 million full-year outlook that we had in place.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I think the other thing, David, is, as you know, we've built a lot of muscle in the Fiserv machine around this. And it's always an estimate at the beginning of the year on how we're going to do and the progress that we're going to make, especially when we're relatively early in a program as we are with the current phase.","And part of what gave Bob the confidence to be quite bullish at our Investor Day is the progress that we're making this year. One of the things that we're also working on that we didn't talk about, but it's important, is over the last several quarters and just going live this week, we moved our Architect platform to the cloud. And that kind of work, which is part of this, doesn't drive any definitive cost sales now, but it allows us to provide a fully cloud-based solution, digital solution to our clients.","But also over time, the economic benefits of being cloud-enabled are very, very, very substantial. So, we're finding that mix between making investments and doing things that are going to pay off today and making investments and taking actions that are really setting ourselves up for the next phase that Bob referenced at our recent Investor Day.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Quick final question for me, if we strip out the write-off in the Payments business, it looked like you continue to have nice margin expansion there. How much of that is driven by the 30% Mobiliti ASP growth, and to what extent is that type of growth sustainable?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, there are really a few drivers to that and I'll probably miss some of it and so, Bob will add in. There's certainly a little bit of it and some of it coming through from Mobiliti and the ASP technology. And most of that is just because, as you know, most of our investments are big investments, are fixed cost investments and then the revenue that comes through is at a pretty high margin, and so we're seeing that.","But we're seeing that drop-through on many of our products. So, whether it's debit or our ACH processing platform or whatever the scale payments platforms are, those are going to make those contributions. We're also making a little less organic investment in this segment right now. We had been making significant investments, as you know, around EMV. That's now fully scaled.","The other thing is that because we are now anniversarying against EMV, right, the margin itself, we're not getting a lot of \u2013 a little bit lower incremental margins. So, your point about backing the $15 million out, I mean, those margins are quite high and I think, as Bob mentioned in his remarks, the 34.7% margin for the first half of the year is the highest first half margin we've ever had in Payments.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","And that number includes the $15 million charge.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","The $15 million.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","That's right.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you very much.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Huff from Stephens. Your line is open.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good afternoon guys.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Two questions. One, can you give us just more thoughts on the P2P? You mentioned some really nice rollouts and some good numbers. How is the working with the broader umbrella of Zelle? It sounds like it's benefiting you guys, particularly given it sounds like you had a lot of people in the first class of go-lives. Any insights in the first month or so since that's been live?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that as, I'll put this in air quotes. As bank consortia go that the Zelle group, the former clearXchange EWS group has worked together well and we have a very strong relationship with them, which has allowed us to be close to the decisions and be on top of what we need to be doing to make sure that our clients and frankly new clients that we're winning already. We not only, as you know, we have well over 2,000 institutions who are or have been Popmoney institutions.","And so, we expect many of those, if not all of those over time to become part of the quote, the Zelle mandate, end quote. But we're also winning new clients. Of the few that we mentioned today, of the top 25, one of those three was brand new to the company and I can think of a number of institutions who are just coming in because we happen to have the payments, the DDA-based payments expertise and frankly the most working knowledge in the industry around P2P. And remember, the importance of P2P is not just moving money, but it's having the matured risk capabilities and network capabilities that we have been working on frankly since 2011.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then any update on the OBS and the cash management consolidation or the investments you're making there? We're looking around and seeing there is a number of new entrants, be it another core processor is going to have an organic version, there's a lot of people who seem to kind of be reinvesting in that as processors go after that. Any thoughts on that market, how it's developing and how you guys feel about the position?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. I mean the commercial cash management is really important because institutions are serving generally who they would view as their most important clients with that technology and it's the intermediary technology that the commercial customers are using many, many, many times per day, and so it's critical. We had for many years a very strong kind of mid-market technology, but it's just we didn't think that was sufficient to meet the rising expectations that we see out in digital and so buying OBS, as you know, brought that to the party.","Frankly, we have \u2013 even as bullish and as optimistic as we were with that acquisition at the time, the combination of OBS to allow institutions to serve their large commercial customers. And as you know, this goes all the way up through the sizing of banks, Cap One and SunTrust are both large OBS customers. So, we have the ability to serve very large and commercial customers. So, for us, that combination with Architect has really been quite powerful in the market.","It really is \u2013 it has \u2013 in the early days, retail was more important in the \u2013 because so many institutions were interacting with the \u2013 I'm sorry, so many customers are interacting with the FIs on that basis, but commercial is now absolutely critical. And the ability to go out and win larger bundled deals, like the Dime Community Bank that we talked about today is quite important. So, we're excited about it and we think that's going to lead us to a lot of new business over the next several years.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Hi, Jeff, Bob, Mark. Good afternoon.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, I guess my first question is on free cash flow performance, pretty solid in the first half, but as your internal growth recovers in the second half and also you have ongoing digital investments, would you expect the free cash flow performance to sort of decelerate in the second half? The reason I ask is, your new FCF metric would support this, but on the other hand, you've got cost initiatives, the Fast Start program, which would indicate otherwise. So, can you comment on expected free cash flow performance?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. Ashwin, it's Bob. I would say, overall, obviously we're very pleased with where we started the first half of the year, up meaningful over the prior year. I certainly wouldn't anticipate that level of year-over-year growth to continue into the balance of the year, but we certainly expect to have a very strong free cash flow. The guidance on the free cash flow conversion metric is 108% to 111%. We fully expect to achieve that. Through the first half of the year, we're at 105%, but off to a great start.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And second question is, I guess on competitive landscape and, Jeff, I get your comments that you had on Misys\/D+H, but on the other hand, Temenos on its call indicated a strong pipeline they won Commerce Bank, Ally Bank in the past year or so. Obviously, two clients against the thousands you have, small, but they're good-sized banks, not something that happens too often. And the question really becomes, you're going to be increasingly fighting cloud-based deals, Architect and Temenos and so on. How does that affect the economics of your business that needed CapEx and so on?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, that's a good question, Ashwin. Obviously, the Commerce deal was something that we were battling for as well and we did not end up getting selected. The difference between that kind of a transaction or the Allied transaction where in many of the smaller institutions and I don't mean that negatively, but the smaller institutions will tend to buy on a bundled basis. In the larger clients, that's not the case. So, Commerce may have bought a core engine, but we actually provide them many of their digital and payment solutions. And so as you move up that food chain, winning the core processing capability is certainly important and something we'd like to do, but we still have many relationships with these institutions.","And in this case, the core provider doesn't have the capabilities to displace us and so, it is a little bit different than you see in other parts of the landscape. The other thing I would say is those larger clients as much as we'd like to win them, they tend to be multi-year, two, three, four, five-year kinds of implementations. And frankly, it's a lot of services revenue and for us, we don't think that's necessarily our sweet spot. We really are building our company to be in the, call it in the $25 billion and less space on the bundled value proposition.","Now, we'll move up and we have clients that are larger than that and for clients who want the modern technologies that we provide and they want an integration advantage and that's great. But if they're really looking for a very heavy professional services and license-type transaction, we have to evaluate each one of those and make a determination, is it somewhere where we want to play and are we best suited to deliver that, given the opportunity cost that's associated with those kinds of transactions.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. That's a great explanation. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, in the prepared comments you talked about the number of DNA wins that you expect to come on back half of the year as well as some Mobiliti wins you expect to come on later this year. Can you maybe give us a sense about the relative magnitude of both of those items, and then whether you would expect these to kind of be more Q4 events or whether we can see some contribution in Q3 as well?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So, on DNA, we generally would expect those to be probably even, I think we said at least 10, 5 and 5-ish.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","About right.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","But remember, you've got the aggregate of best of that because we had six go live in this quarter. But, we would expect to see that. And then, as it relates to Payments, we would expect to see, my guess is, most of those implementations will bias to Q4, just because it takes time to get them implemented and get the UIs where they want to be. So, that will probably bias a little bit more to Q4.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks. And then, maybe to follow on an earlier question for you, Bob. Maybe just give us a status update in terms of the \u2013 on the data center part of operational effectiveness, what actions you took in the quarter and then whether you think that there is any potential to kind of pull in any of the planned 2018 actions to 2017 given you're running ahead of plan?","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I would say overall the favorability or the strength of the overall OE savings, the $40 million in the first half of the year, I think we described it as workforce optimization, procurement and DCO. I would put them in that order in terms of the actual savings generated with DCO being a relatively modest contributor at this point. We're still in the phase of getting that activity ramped up and expect to see that in the latter part of the current phase of the program.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Jim, I would say that the way to think about DCO is, there are very long planning tails on that and if you move up something by a month or by two months, right, which is unlikely, right, they're usually right up to the expected time, you get only a tiny benefit. So, the majority of the increments doesn't come from DCO. We would have to start doing things now to see benefits at the end of \u2013 probably at the end of 2018 and to early 2019. So just think about it, those are longer tailed activities.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paulo Ribeiro from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Paulo E. Ribeiro - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Thanks for the opportunity.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure.","Paulo E. Ribeiro - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Jeff, last quarter you talked about Fast Start and \u2013 but could you just tell, give an update how is that going, or is that specific for first quarter in terms of shortening conversion cycles and driving revenue early in the year?","Second and kind of related question here is on receivables, we also saw last quarter you were able to bring it down and you did again this quarter. Do you anticipate that you'll continue to bring it down in terms of U.S. dollars and days in the second half of the year? Thank you.","Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. So, let me \u2013 this is Mark Ernst. Let me start with the kind of the what our learning is on the Fast Start. Overall, I think we would judge that some of the things that we did demonstrated that we do have the ability to, within range, kind of move some of the sales activity forward. We're pretty encouraged by that. It's unclear at this point whether that results in more overall sales, but it does have the effect of bringing in transactions that we can implement more quickly and, therefore, get a fourth quarter effect that might have otherwise slipped into the subsequent years. So, overall I'd say we are pleased with what we saw so far with Fast Start, but the kind of the full \u2013 and the full effects of it, I think, are still things that we're working through.","Paulo E. Ribeiro - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","And then in terms of accounts receivable, Paulo, we saw some ramp-up if you recall into the second half of last year. We saw that come down nicely in Q1 and again in Q2, to a slightly lesser extent, but still an improvement. I would expect us to be able to maintain it from a days' standpoint with some growth in revenue in the second half of the year, accelerated growth. We'll continue to work that receivable and generate good cash for the full year.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hey, Paulo, one thing I would add to the Fast Start commentary is when we created the program, we had a thesis that if it were to work, we would likely see more increases in product-oriented, license-oriented product revenue. And in fact, what we ended up seeing was some of that, but actually more sales of whether they be in-house to outsource migrations, but other kinds of revenue that is more recurring that we thought had longer cycles. And we saw people work hard to bring them in early and to Mark's point, that revenue instead of slipping into the early part of 2018, because it wouldn't have gotten signed until the middle of the year or later in the year, we're optimistic that we'll start to see some of that rev come in, in Q4. But that was an interesting learning, the ability to move clients on the decision cycle on even longer recurring revenue kinds of add-on sales.","Paulo E. Ribeiro - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Great color. Just if I can sneak one more in just quickly. Generally, in terms of IT spend, do you see some changes this quarter versus last quarter in terms of where banks are putting their dollars?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I would say generally no with one exception and that is that especially in the larger banks, Zelle is taking a lot of the mindshare, people wanting to get on the Zelle bandwagon before the consortia starts its advertising and marketing. But really the priorities remain the same, focused on digital, digital experience, commercial, making money, those kinds of things and there continues to be a bit of optimism in the market on rates and those kinds of things. So, but it's about the spend itself is about the same.","Paulo E. Ribeiro - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you. Great call.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey guys, I appreciate you taking the call and all the granularity on the second half here.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. Sure, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Jeff and Mark maybe, sort of a longer-term question, understandably a lot of enthusiasm about Zelle and the ramp and the visibility it creates for your organic revenue growth at the back half and beyond. Can you shed a little light on how you see the longer-term nature of those contracts going? In other words, I imagine there are some minimums up front and at some point, it transitions over into either user-based pricing or transaction-based pricing. How would you expect that revenue stream to evolve?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","So, I think at Investor Day, Mark had laid out some, I think, using ITAA (49:00) data, laid out kind of how the P2P market would grow and so, none of us have a crystal ball and there's lots of hypothecation out there, but we generally think that that hypothesis is as good as any of them. But we do think that P2P is going to grow and P2P is going to end up being an important part of how consumers move money as compared to the check and cash that generally P2P payments are focused with today.","So, most of our pricing is transactional and so as transactions grow, we would expect to follow that kind of growth much like we did in the bill payment business in the early days of CheckFree, when it went from very little up to being quite significant. And so, we do expect that. Right now, the majority of the revenue, the new revenue that's being created is still small on the transactional side and much more around implementations of services and the like. So, that's how we see that and again, I expect that to happen. We expect that to happen over quite a long period of time in terms of having the market grow to some level of quasi-maturity.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And I imagine given the sort of rolling nature of these implementations, it gives you some timeline as far as end user adoption.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. And we're going to be, just given the size of our base and the demand in the market, we're going to be implementing people for a long time. And we literally have thousands of implementations. We're going to have thousands of implementations to do. So, that is going to be a nice bridge, while the transactions themselves are building.","The other really important element of this is, we believe that as people become more fluent users with P2P that in fact, that will also translate to other DDA-based payments. So, more bank-based bill pay, more account-to-account transfer, more activity used in the personal payments device that we refer to as a phone. So, all of that, we think will turn into goodness across our DDA-based payment suite.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Condra from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks and afternoon, everybody.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Paul.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, Jeff, I just wanted to ask, you talked about some de novo activity that look positive. I wondered if you could give a little more detail there and talk about what you're seeing.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're actually now into the double digits of de novos this year. So, I think we're around 10, we're in that high single-digit, low double-digit range and there are lots of applications in there. And so, we're optimistic now. That doesn't sound like a lot relative to the past, but frankly that's probably as many de novos as we've seen in the last three to four years combined. So, we're feeling good about that.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I mean, is there anything that stands out to you as to why that activity will be picking up, just where we are in the cycle of interest rates or?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I think it's a combination of bank regulators being more comfortable with the stability of the market and frankly, the ability to make a little bit more money as rates have been moving up. But there has been a lot of demand for de novos for a while, it's really just been the regulators who have not been willing to approve charters.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thanks. And then I guess, a nice job maintaining the outlook even with the $0.05 hit. Bob, I was just curious if you would be \u2013 would have been raising your EPS outlook for the year if you didn't have that one-time expense issue.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. That's an interesting hypothetical question. The fact is, we've done well from an operational efficiency standpoint having $40 million behind us and now expecting to overachieve the $60 million, a $0.05 headwind certainly is an impact to the overall guidance range. It's got $0.14 in it. Certainly disappointed that we have the charge, but still feel good about A, having record operating margin in the quarter both for the Payments segment as well as the overall company and being able to maintain the guidance.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","I mean, those kinds of hypotheticals are almost impossible to answer. I would say that historically by the time we get to Q2, we have a pretty good feel for how the rest of the year is going to shake out on the EPS side. I mean we're highly confident in our EPS range for the year and so \u2013 and that's taking the $0.05 in. So, I would say that we would be even more confident if we weren't making up for that $0.05. We are excited about the fact that next year that $0.05 will not recur and that's good news.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. Thanks. Good momentum all.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering if you could update us on the growth initiatives, especially given the charge, maybe what's working and what isn't?","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Are you talking about the growth initiatives that we talked about at Investor Day?","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","That's right. I wasn't sure if the charge was linked to it, maybe you can give us some update on \u2013 or more detail on the charge and any update on how the growth initiatives are...","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that nothing has changed since Investor Day. We're with those items. The charge had nothing to do with the growth initiatives that we laid out, really had to do with some internal use software.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And then, just on the pipeline, I know you gave some color earlier, but how does the pipeline for the second half look versus the first half and maybe you can give us some color on some expectations on your conversion rate assumptions. Are they the same in the second half as the first half? Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. Sure. We have a good growth in our pipe. We are up in sales about 10% for the year. We expect our win rates to remain about the same. We have some larger transactions that are in the pipeline and we're also filling the pipeline nicely against some of the strategic initiatives that we talked about. So, we basically \u2013 we have confidence in the numbers and we're comfortable that we'll make the full-year sales.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Cantwell from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I just wanted to get your thoughts on the potential impact on your margins Zelle could have looking a little further out as it ramps more meaningfully. You mentioned this quarter ex the one-time item, operating margin would have been up significantly. So, I'm wondering if Zelle's ramp would mean you could do even better looking out into 2018 or just how you think about quantifying its impact. Thanks.","Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.","Sure. So, the best \u2013 probably the best way to think about Zelle is in the next \u2013 in the kind of the foreseeable future, so as we're going through our implementation cycles. The majority of the revenue that comes in on that conversion and implementations has different characteristics than the transactional revenue. When the transactions start to bypass the implementation revenue, we would expect those kinds of margins to look very similar to all the other large payments processing engines that we have in the company, whether they be debt or bill pay or the like. So, we would expect over time \u2013 without regard to pricing, we would expect over time that those margins would look pretty attractive.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great.

With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our CEO; Tom Hirsch, our CFO; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted revenue growth, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, free cash flow per share, revenue and cost synergies, sales pipelines, acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release, which can be found at our website at fiserv.com, for a discussion of these risk factors.","You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Eric, and good afternoon. Overall, 2012 was a year of strategic progress and generally solid financial results, including our 27th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Although revenue was below plan for the year, the downside of lower license revenue was partially offset by strong gains in our primary objective: building recurring revenue, which should continue as a result of several large sale successes this year.","In the 3 weeks since the Open acquisition, we've become even more bullish about the depth of strategic fit and the opportunities that we have to deliver value to our clients. The market reaction has been more positive than I had anticipated, and our teams are working very well together. We're off to a great start on integration, and drilling into the more than $125 million of synergy opportunities identified in this transaction. We feel very good about this complementary acquisition, which broadens our offerings in several key areas.","Now let me move on to the results. For the fourth quarter, adjusted revenue was flat and was up 3% for the year. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was up 9% to $1.39 and increased 12% to $5.13 for the full year, our first time crossing the $5 per share mark and well within our guidance for the full year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter increased 70 basis points over last year's fourth quarter and 90 basis points, sequentially. Full year adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points to 29.6%, which is compelling considering the reduction in high-margin license revenue.","Free cash flow for the year was up to $772 million and free cash flow per share was up 8% to a record $5.61 per share. We had a very strong finish to sales and ended the year at 105% of quota. In particular, 2012 was a fantastic year for our bill payment business. We closed more business in 2012 than in 2008, '09 and '10 combined.","We had 3 key priorities for 2012. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Second, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients.","Although 2012 adjusted internal revenue growth was below our expectations, this does not represent a change in our business. In fact, as Tom will highlight, processing and services revenue increased 5% in 2012, while our product revenue declined 3%, due primarily to the lower discretionary license revenue in the quarter compared to the exceptional prior year's results.","The consistency of our business model is reflected in the 12% growth in adjusted earnings per share, along with the 40-basis-point increase in adjusted operating margin; this, despite the ramping of our newer solutions and a margin drag from the shortfall in discretionary license revenue. We remain committed to centering the Fiserv culture on growth in order to build additional high-quality revenue.","Our sales in the fourth quarter were exceptional, attaining 126% of quota and 105% for the year. These strong results were led by sales of outsource solutions and core processing and payments. Earlier in the year, we signed a number of new strategic bill payment clients, including TD Bank and Regions Bank. That momentum carried into the fourth quarter as we added Union Bank and expanded our long-time bill payment relationship with Wells Fargo bank, which we expect will contribute meaningful new revenue in 2014.","Add the 10-year renewal of our Bank of America relationship and our bill payment business is in by far the best position to have sustained growth acceleration since we acquired CheckFree back in 2007.","We also gained important share in our newer recurring revenue solutions such as Mobiliti. We added more than 550 financial institution clients in 2012. Even more important, we ended the year in our ASP offering with over 830,000 mobile subscribers, a far cry from the less than 1,000 we had at the beginning of 2010. This is just one of several examples in which our add-on solutions are driving value for clients and attractive growth for us.","Our last, and arguably highest priority for 2012, was a focus on providing differentiating solutions that enhance client results. Financial institutions are focused on driving revenue and increasing efficiency as they face low rates and regulatory burdens. This challenge is compounded by empowered consumers who are increasingly demanding anytime, anywhere access to their banking services. To that end, we see the convergence of mobile and payments to be one of the most interesting opportunities in the market. We now have nearly 1,400 mobile clients, have expanded our P2P network to over 1,800 Popmoney clients, including many of the largest institutions in the U.S. We met our commitment of making realtime Popmoney transactions available in the fourth quarter, which we believe is a true game changer. We expect to extend realtime enablement to several of our core payment capabilities, which we believe is differentiating for our clients and should unlock significant market value.","Lastly, as we shared in conjunction with the Open Solutions acquisition, we plan to enhance the value of our new DNA account processing platform with elements of our innovative Acumen solution. Even though we plan to add functionality over time to further enhance the solution, DNA is ready for prime time, right now. We have a very active pipeline and have already signed our first new Fiserv DNA client. The nearly 600 clients who are on the DNA platform today are happy and see increased opportunities moving forward.","With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom to provide more details on our financial results for the year.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted internal revenue growth was flat in the quarter and up 2% for the full year. As we discussed a few weeks ago, revenue in the quarter and primarily in December was negatively impacted by weak Acumen revenue and lower discretionary license, services and hardware revenue across the company compared to the superior performance in the prior year's fourth quarter.","Overall license fees, which represent only about 4% of annual adjusted revenue, were down approximately $30 million for the year; about $25 million was in the fourth quarter and a substantial majority of that occurred in December. The shortfall in onetime revenue was partially offset by sequential acceleration in our Payments segment revenue growth rate to 3% in the quarter. Processing and services revenue in the fourth quarter, which is primarily made up of our recurring revenue solutions was up 4% over last year, while product revenue, which includes license fees, was down.","We continue to see strong demand for the outsourcing solutions that Jeff highlighted earlier that drive revenue, customer value and efficiency for our clients. We are making great progress in growing our high-quality base of recurring revenue, which should continue to drive operating margin expansion and cash flow growth over the long term.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 9% in the quarter to $1.39 and 12% for the full year to $5.13, squarely within our guidance range. Adjusted operating income was $334 million for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 30.7%, an increase of 70 basis points over the prior year's fourth quarter and up 90 basis points over the third quarter, including the negative impact of the lower license fees in the fourth quarter.","Full year adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points compared to last year, primarily driven by growth in high-margin recurring revenue and the success of our operational effectiveness initiatives. This was partially offset by increased sales costs and product investments, expected dilution from the CashEdge acquisition and lower license revenue.","Now on to the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 3% to $572 million in the quarter and was up 4% to $2.2 billion for the full year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter and 2% for the full year. Card services and digital channels continued to drive strong revenue growth in 2012, which was partially offset by weaker performance in bill payment and investment services and the anticipated negative Durbin impact on our Biller Solutions business. Bill payment transaction volume improved from the negative transaction growth in the third quarter. We expect to see accelerated growth in the bill payment business in 2013, given the number of large new wins Jeff highlighted earlier.","We produced strong results in our debit business with transaction volume increasing 15% and 16% in the quarter and year, respectively, driven by the continued expansion of our client base. Adjusted operating income in the Payments segment was up to $179 million in the quarter compared to $174 million in the previous year. Year-to-date adjusted operating income was $668 million for the year compared to $656 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 31.2% in the quarter, flat compared to the fourth quarter of last year and down 70 basis points to 30.3% for the full year.","Segment operating margin for the year was negatively impacted by bill payment deconversions, the expected margin pressure from CashEdge and the ramp-up of our offerings in digital solutions.","Financial segment adjusted revenue declined 3% in the quarter to $524 million but increased 2% to $2 billion for the full year. The shortfall in license revenue in December I mentioned earlier, drove virtually all of the negative impact in the quarterly results for the segment. Operating income for the quarter in the Financial segment was down slightly to $173 million. Operating margin was flat in the quarter at 33.1%, which was strong performance given the negative impact of the license revenue shortfall.","For the year, segment operating margin was up 140 basis points to 32% on the continued leverage in our core account processing businesses, incremental savings from our operational effectiveness initiatives and increased efficiencies in our item processing business.","The adjusted operating loss in our Corporate segment for the fourth quarter was $18 million, consistent with the $21 million in our second and third quarters' performance. The loss was lower than the prior year's fourth quarter, due primarily to the quarterly timing of expenses in 2011.","Our adjusted effective tax rate of 37.1% for the quarter was in line with our expectations. And the 35.7% adjusted full year rate was slightly lower than 2011. For 2013, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to also be slightly lower than the 2012 full year rate.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $271 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year. For the full year, free cash flow was $772 million compared to $746 million in 2011. The 2012 total excludes nearly $70 million of cash we received in the quarter, including a distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture, which is included in net cash from investing activities, and an insurance recovery, which is included in discontinued operations.","Free cash flow per share grew 8% to $5.61 for the full year and was primarily impacted by higher tax payments during the year compared to 2011. We completed our refinancing activities during the year by issuing $700 million of new 10-year notes at 3.5%, repaying the balance of our 2007 term loan and entering into a 5-year $2 billion revolving credit facility. In connection with the Open Solutions acquisition in January, we paid off $600 million of this debt using our credit facility, and we expect to use a combination of the facility and cash on hand to redeem the balance of this indebtedness, $325 million of 9.75% notes in February.","We repurchased 9.2 million shares for $625 million during 2012, as compared to 8.8 million shares in 2011 for $533 million. Over the last 2 years, we have repurchased 80 million shares or 12% of our outstanding stock at an average price of just over $64 per share. As of December 31, there were 5.6 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Although we anticipate that we will allocate more cash to debt repayment in 2013, as compared to 2012, we will continue to allocate capital, consistent with our strategy in a manner that builds value for our shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Thanks, Tom. As I mentioned upfront, our sales results in the quarter were outstanding as we achieved 126% of quota and 105% for the full year. The results in the quarter were strong across the board, led by large bill payment transactions with Wells Fargo and Union Bank. We had great success with our payments and channel solutions during the year, including more than 400 new bill payment clients, 165 debit clients, more than 550 Mobiliti clients and over 450 signed up for Popmoney.","Despite the excellent sales performance, our pipeline remains strong as we enter the new year. We also expect the Open Solutions acquisition to contribute momentum as we add new account processing clients, promote our broad-based solution set to our newest clients and expose our existing clients to the high-quality products and services that Open Solutions has to offer.","Integrated sales finished well at $69 million in the quarter and $189 million for the full year. Our operational effectiveness results came in very strong, finishing at $62 million for the year.","We continue to see the financial institution market as stable, but with continuing challenges centered primarily on the revenue and regulatory fronts. 2012 ended with only 64 actions, nearly half as many as there were in 2011, impacting 51 banks and 13 credit unions. In addition, the average size of an impacted institution was down 40% from 2011. Bank M&A activity was down compared to the prior year through September 30th, and we generally expect acquisitions to trend around the same level for 2013.","There had been no de novo charters issued through the end of September, and we also don't expect that trend to change measurably in 2013. We generally expect the moderate growth rate in financial institution IT spend we saw in 2012 to again be similar in 2013. We also believe that outsourced solutions will continue to be favored by the majority of institutions and that integration value will trump best-of-breed value in most cases. Lastly, we expect technology spend to again bias toward solutions that drive revenue, enhance customer relationships and improve efficiency in the nearer term.","Before I get to guidance, let me share our 2013 priorities, which are modified slightly based on market momentum, product strategies and the focus on integration of Open Solutions. First, continue to build high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Our second priority is to extend market momentum into deeper client relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions and third, deliver innovation and integration to enhance results for our clients with an important focus on Open Solutions.","Now to our guidance, which has not changed from the preliminary numbers we shared a few weeks ago. We expect 2013 adjusted revenue to increase by more than 10%, and that adjusted internal revenue growth will be in a range of 3% to 4%. These numbers include approximately $50 million in lost revenue, more than 100 basis points of internal growth this year due to the unusual migration of an account processing client that transitioned to its parent's account processing platform and the impact of the 10-year Bank of America renewal.","We expect 2013 adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% to 18% or a range of $5.88 to $6.07 over 2012. We estimate free cash flow per share will be more than $6.60 per share, an increase of at least 18% over 2012. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand in a range of 10 to 50 basis points. This estimate includes the approximately 60-basis-point negative impact from the revenue headwind and also margin dilution associated with the Open acquisition.","For modeling purposes, we anticipate that our revenue and earnings growth will be sequentially stronger each quarter as we move through the year. A number of our larger recurring revenue client conversions are planned for the second and third quarters of 2013, and the impact of the negative headwinds are also more pronounced in the first half of the year. We also expect the Open Solutions results to increase during the year, consistent with their normal business model, the cumulative effect of integration benefits and the pay-off of the higher cost debt.","We're in the process of realigning the specific annual targets for our operational effectiveness and integrated sales targets to consider the Open Solutions acquisition. Accordingly, we are now prepared to communicate annual targets for 2013. However, you can be sure we are very focused on these initiatives and we'll provide you with an update at the end of the quarter -- sorry, at the end of the first quarter.","In summary, 2012 was a good year. We made strategic progress, grew recurring revenue, achieved our earnings targets and closed a number of significant sales, all which we believe will accelerate our internal revenue growth, earnings and cash flow. We are starting to see measurable impact from some of our investments and innovation, and are delivering more value to clients. We are also focused on the integration of Open Solutions, which should allow us to deliver new and enhanced value to their more than 3,300 clients. That, combined with the commitment of our more than 20,000 associates, is creating momentum, which should lead to strong results in 2013, and has lifted our confidence for 2014 and beyond.","With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","This quarter, and I know you've sort of talked pretty bullishly about the quota attainment. I was wondering if you could help us sort of think about the sales growth on an absolute basis, both for the quarter and year-over-year. And obviously I would have thought that sales growth, given the tough comp and what you sort of articulated on the license side, would have -- probably would have struggled in the fourth quarter.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Glenn, you cut out a little bit upfront. Would you mind repeating the question just [indiscernible]","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, I was just trying to get a sort of an absolute sales growth for both the quarter and for the year, not the quota attainment, but the absolute sales growth in the context of the license number being down $25 million year-over-year and you had a very difficult comp, so I appreciate that.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Sure. So, Glenn, the -- we don't, as you know, we don't supply kind of the absolute-to-absolute numbers. What I can tell you is we've continued to move our expectations up on a year-in-and-year-out basis for quota attainment. So each year, the quota attainment is getting higher. And you are right, we had a very strong end of last year from a sales perspective. The real difference is in this year, even though we had less revenue coming from license sales, we had substantially more revenue or -- I'm sorry, substantially more sales and therefore, value coming in on the recurring revenue side from processing, whether it be debit or, obviously, we had a significant number of bill payment wins. So the mix of sales, the value of the sales was -- ended up being substantially greater in 2012 than it was in 2011. That's one of the reasons why we're quite bullish kind of moving into 2013 in terms of the size of the recurring revenue contracts that we've signed, as well as the impact that we see on '14 for clients such as Wells Fargo that we mentioned.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I know you -- I appreciate the fact that you're working on sort of a new integrated sales kind of goals, assuming Open. But directionally, what should we assume in terms of the synergy targets you have for Open like directionally, how much contribution on the revenue cost side you're considering for Open within the '13 numbers?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Sure. As you'll recall, Glenn, we talked about $125 million in total synergies, about $50 million of cost and about $75 million of revenue. And given that we've closed this acquisition in January, we would expect those kinds of benefits to ramp. We thought that the -- ramp during this year -- we thought that the cost synergies would occur in a 2- to 3-year period and the revenues would occur about over a 3- to 4-year period. So we don't expect there to be a material synergy impact this year. We expect to actually make a lot of progress capturing the annual value in this year. But we don't expect to have a significant impact on the P&L this year.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one sort of product question and then I'll get out of the question queue. As it relates to Acumen and DNA, I'm a little confused as to how you're leading. Are you going to continue to have the Acumen product going forward, you're just sort of rolling some of the piece parts of Acumen into DNA? And now my understanding that DNA was more of a thrift and credit union product. So I'm confused if you're going to have 2 sort of branded products.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Sure. So from that standpoint, Glenn, we've actually made it pretty clear that our go-forward platform is, in fact, DNA. We do intend to move a number of the more innovative features that we've developed in Acumen into the DNA experience over time. But DNA is a proven platform serving about 600 credit unions, banks and thrifts today and it actually has a large proportion of those being credit union, they have a strong reputation on the credit union side, as well as on the bank side. But probably a deeper reputation on the credit union side of the house today for DNA. So we see that to be a very good alternative in the larger end of the credit union space. And it's very important to us to not have competing platforms in that space. That's really -- so that is one of the reasons why we expect -- not expect, we will move forward with DNA as our offering in that space.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, on the licensing revenue shortfall that you obviously talked about a couple of weeks ago. To what extent do you think that 2012 was the outlier or do you think that the fourth quarter of '11 was the outlier? Just trying to figure out on a go-forward basis, what we should think of as normalized.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think -- Chris, this is Tom. I think looking back on hindsight, fourth quarter of 2011 was just exceptional from a license standpoint. And I think given the kind of the buying patterns that we're seeing from our customers, more focused on recurring revenue solutions that I would say, we hope there's more additional upside going forward. But clearly, I think 2012 should be more of the benchmark as we look into 2013 and '14, especially given the fact that, as Jeff highlighted, whether it be mobile or other solutions that we have, a lot of the recurring revenue outsourcing solutions are in high demand from our client base.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then a question on Popmoney. Just how should we think about the -- I guess both from a revenue and expense perspective, when will we start to see revenue show up in the P&L and it be, I guess, noticeable? And then on the flip side, on the expense side, should we expect some expenses to kind of start to fall off of the P&L as we move through 2013?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So, Chris, the Popmoney P&L is, as you alluded to, is a somewhat small P&L today. We have spent the majority of our energy over the last 18 months on P2P really building a sizable network. We were excited to have an opportunity to bring our realtime capability into market in the fourth quarter, which we think is really an exciting way to provide differentiation in the market. That said, we're now moving our focus over to what are the right ways to think about driving transactions and the different venues in which we will do that. Instead of talking more specifically about the expenses again or the revenue, I would say that they're embedded in our assumptions for 2013. And we have not really ever believed that we would see really measurable impact from this probably until 2014 and then that will actually ramp for quite a number of years. Not unlike, if you want to look for an example, unlike what happened with bill payment back in the early 2000s.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess my last question is just on the new Wells relationship or upgraded Wells relationship. Just could you remind us what you did with Wells before and how that relationship specifically has expanded?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So we have done a variety of different things for Wells. I'd rather not talk in specifics about what they do, but we have been providing them with a series of different value-add solutions on -- in terms of e-bill and some other products like that. And Wells got to the point where they were looking for ways to, as many institutions do, have -- perhaps have less providers. And so they looked at an opportunity within their bill payment business to put some of the business together and that's what they ended up doing. And we were fortunate enough to be able to win that business.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I hope you can hear me okay. I'm on the road. Just want a couple of clarifications. Just on the fourth quarter license sales, now were those -- the discretionary shortfall, was that a pushout or did those things -- did you just not expect those sales to materialize? Just trying to understand the change.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I think most of those, I would think for -- when I look out for the full year, I think some of that is going to get pushed into 2013, but I would say that we're not anticipating a lot of license revenue growth over where we were in 2012 because again, the demand we're seeing in the client base is coming a lot from our outsourcing solutions. So that's how I would look at that.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes. And, Tien-Tsin, I would also say this really adds on a little bit to one of the earlier questions. It really -- as we go back and look, we've done not surprisingly a lot of analysis to understand this shortfall. And there really was a bit of an anomalous effect in the fourth quarter of 2011, where the license revenue really jumped up kind of out of trend, if you look back over the 3 or 4 years prior to that. So I think it is a combination. There were some sales and some activity at the end of the year that didn't get done and so that may, in fact, push. But I do think it's more of the anomaly in '11. And to Tom's point, we've really said we don't expect to see this big recapture of that license revenue. We're really thinking that license revenue will go back to what we had seen in the 3 or so years prior to '11 and using that as our trend as opposed to thinking it's all going to come back this year.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes. As you know, it's only about -- today, it's about 4% of our total revenue.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood, understood it's small. And I'm just trying to balance out sort of the learnings of the bubble last year versus how your expectation changed, but I think I get it. So just on the -- obviously, a lot of consolidation has been happening with, I guess, online resources as well getting consumed and you've taken a lot of bill pay business to -- so far, which is great. So what do you think that deal means for you in the pipeline for potentially scaling up your share in bill pay?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes. I mean, I don't actually think it'll have a significant -- it won't signal any kind of significant change in our competitive strategy. I mean, to your point, we've been pretty focused on winning share in the bill payment space. We've done a nice job of that, winning some larger deals over the last couple of years really. And so we'll continue to do that, as well as really making sure that we're doing a nice job delivering as much value as we can to our core clients who use bill pay. And as you know very well, that was a strategy that we started upon early en masse upon the acquisition of CheckFree. So I don't see it having a significant impact on the competitive landscape. From our perspective, we still think there's a lot of value to be derived in strategies that involve bundling. We're very excited about our realtime opportunities and expedited payment opportunities there. And then frankly, when you think about technology, such as e-bill, which are quite differentiating versus the competition, we just believe we have the best solution in the market. And that today, with consumers, the way they are in terms of looking for very high quality product, whether it's availability or feature function, I mean, we bring the best product to the market and we think that's what consumers are demanding and we think that's one of the main reasons why we've been winning. So from our perspective, we'll continue to be out there fighting for business each and every day. But we do have the benefit of having of a very, very strong solution.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good. Just one last one, if you don't mind. Open, $50 million cost synergies, should we just simplistically cut that $50 million in 3 and spread it out over the next 3 years? I always thought that maybe I'd get more upfront given presumably some overlap and also, this is a type of equity play. So I think that their costs were taken out unintended but [indiscernible] there would be helpful.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, yes, Tien-Tsin. I mean, we would expect to actually identify and be able to action a good amount of the cost synergies in year one. And have some -- certainly, have some benefit in our P&L in '13. I wouldn't think that doing 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3 is the right way to think about it because of the impact of annualization and other things. Certainly, there are some synergies that you can get on day one but we're deep into an integration planning process right now. We want to make sure that we're making smart moves on the cost side, smart moves on the revenue side, and we'll likely bias to make sure we take the time that's needed so that we can continue to serve the clients very well, which is our #1 priority. And then, really look to make sure that we are delivering on the synergy commitments that we have that we are highly confident in, both in 2013, as well as over the horizon overall.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes. Let me just add one thing. I think you make a good point. I mean, this is private equity-backed so there was not a lot of obvious things to just go in there and take out of the cost structure. So from our perspective, there's going to be much work to be done to sort through what's the right organizational structure, the right way to serve clients going forward before we start taking wholesale costs out of the system.","Operator","Next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It sounds like great momentum in bill pay, so congrats on that. I guess, my question on bill pay, specifically, it seems like you troughed in Q3 and things are already getting better in Q4. I'm wondering how good can bill pay transaction growth be in 2013. And maybe if you can segment that a little bit into core -- kind of the core existing base of business growth and then how much of it might be new client growth?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes. So Dave -- and thanks for the comments. We'll have some pretty solid transaction growth in '13 for sure as we bring on some of these larger clients beginning in Q2 and 3. And that -- and those will primarily be on the kind of the non-account processing integrated sales side even though the majority of our clients, the client wins and numbers, come on that side of the ledger, the majority of the transactions will come from some of the larger clients, such as TD. We would expect those to ramp up really over the next 18 months in terms of the acquisition -- I'm sorry, in terms of the implementations from this year. And then, as we mentioned, we have a large client that will go live in '14 and so that will ramp up as well. So we would actually expect to have a very attractive ramp in '13, but also have a good ramp in '14 and moving forward as we shared at Investor Day. So we are quite bullish on this. And then we also really like what we're seeing on the mobile bill payment front, seeing lots of interesting growth there. Now that's a kind of a gross view and we haven't yet been able to determine how much is moving from channel to channel, but we actually are somewhat ambivalent to that. We just want people paying bills and that and whether it's on a mobile phone, a tablet or using their PC, we're really excited about that. We also -- as you may have seen, we also had our 2 billionth bill presented in the fourth quarter and we think that's actually -- bodes well for our differentiation in the value proposition that we're delivering to consumers and their financial institutions.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, okay. Okay, good. And so would you say, on top of -- I mean, obviously, you're doing very well on the sales front and that's going to add a lot over the next couple of years. Do you feel like the existing client base is also -- like is there a little bit of an inflection within the existing client base too, that actual organic kind of bill pay growth is happening again?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, good question. We are -- we actually saw some pretty good -- looking at the individual clients, we saw some pretty nice growth happening in the fourth quarter in certain places. In places that -- and you can imagine, right, the growth hasn't been as strong and so that has a little bit of an impact. But we also talked about some deconversions, right? Some deconversions that we were dealing with on some remit-only clients and a couple of reseller clients. And those will all anniversary out this year. So the good news is we would expect to see a little bit of a tailwind even on our organic transaction base.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just my final one and this is more for Tom, I guess, is just, obviously, a lot of moving parts within the interest expense line given Open's coming on. There's some high rate debt that gets paid off in February. What maybe for a full year should we expect for the interest expense line to be?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I mean it's going to be up, Dave, clearly on an incremental basis, primarily just from the Open Solutions interest expense. So I'd say that's a couple of percent on the incremental basis and you can probably do that for modeling.","Operator","Next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just have one quick one. I was just going back through the Investor Day presentation and trying to sort of put my arms around the Acumen commentary that you guys had at that point suggested significant growth opportunities and you guys seemed pretty committed to the platform. But then, obviously, there was a change and now we're talking about this acquisition and DNA is kind of the growth going forward in terms of the driver. What was the change or what is it that you guys -- the change you're thinking around Acumen as the platform versus DNA going forward now?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes. Julio, the real impetus there was we were struggling with the amount of customization and the time to implement Acumen versus the very significant market opportunity that we were uncovering in terms of an innovative platform. You may recall for the last 18 months or so, our comments had been around the fact that we were somewhat surprised at how much movement a new innovative platform was able to dislodge in the existing large credit union space. And we had really strong success with Acumen. You think about a brand-new, to some extent, untested platform is out there winning deal after deal after deal. And those deals aren't just platform, account processing core platform deals. They bring a lot of content with them. So our payment solutions, risk, channels, all kinds of add-on value. So which made that core sale when you add on the 3 to 5x incremental value from the Integrated Solutions, it made it really important to capture that opportunity as fast as possible. So when that converged reality hit us, we really said we think the best thing for us to do is to go in a direction that will allow us to capture as much of the share in that very attractive market as we can. And at the same time, also add, call it, 800 or so core clients that didn't have the integrated value. They didn't have the bundled value that we have within Fiserv and we just thought that made a ton of sense. Specifically, on the Acumen side though, it's really about being able to capture that opportunity as fast as possible and not allow any other competitors to get in with a new solution.","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, we were basically backed up I think for new deals to the end of 2015, somewhere in that particular place because of the complexity of the installations, et cetera and the customization. So that's why we made the strategic decision that Jeff talked about.","Mark A. Ernst","But in contrast to where we were on Investor Day, I mean, don't take any of this to suggest that on Investor Day, we were not very committed and didn't see the opportunity that we have with Acumen. It was more that the opportunity came along to have a proven platform in the form of DNA that allows us now to accelerate the speed with which we can take this solution out to the market.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. That's helpful. And just one last one on the tone of demand. There was -- if I heard you say, Jeff, something about regulatory and some other issues. If you sort of put aside the -- kind of the headwinds that we know for the contracts and all that stuff, where are you guys in terms of your customers thinking about demand? It sounds like outsourcing is, obviously, still very much in focus but are there other constraints with the customer base that keeps them from stepping up the spending or thinking through some of the demand drivers? Maybe you can just sort of help us frame that a little bit, that would be great.","Mark A. Ernst","Yes. Hey, this is Mark. So the thing I would tell you is we have seen and continue to see this move toward -- away from in-house toward outsourcing. While that isn't a dramatic change, it is a continuous shift that we see in the market. And so one of the things that we know is happening inside of our portfolio of clients is as we have seen that shifting going on now for a number of years, we have fewer and fewer in-house buying points for new license add-ons, those kinds of things. And we have a larger and larger share of our overall base that is benefiting from our outsourced sort of delivery method. So that is -- that trend not only continues, but it probably -- it also contributes to the issues or the challenges that we will face, both now and in the future with how big we can make license sales.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Julio, the other thing is, kind of from an industry perspective, the real constraint that our clients and the market has is revenue is at a premium. And with spreads remaining very low, fee revenue being attacked, that's the real challenge. And we continue to see that rub [ph] -- manifesting itself against how much are banks willing to spend. And so as we've said before, we continue to benefit from where we are positioned in terms of the Channel Solutions, mobile and tablet is becoming a very big deal. The ability to have clients act, cross-sell those kinds of technology solutions and intelligence is really important. And so that's really where we are seeing the focus within the financial institutions. And I don't expect that to really change. I don't expect the purse strings to loosen until the banks and thrifts and credit unions are able to make more money. And we, at least for purposes of thinking about our own guidance, right, we're basically saying that aspect of the environment will remain relatively muted or very similar to what we saw in '12. So we don't expect or need a change in spending. If we were to -- if there -- a change in spending were to occur, we think we would benefit from it, but we're really focused on some of those technologies that will help financial institutions deal with the environment the way it is today.","Operator","Next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Could you walk through the biggest drivers of outperformance on your cost-reduction program for 2012? And give us an updated target for 2013 cost takeout or operational effectiveness as you dub it? And what would be the biggest drivers of cost savings for next year, excluding the Open Solutions acquisition?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes. I think the -- in regards to 2012, I think, the biggest area are our shared services opportunities, which is all around the sorts of things that we continue to focus on, whether that be around our globalization initiatives, whether that be around our procurement initiatives, whether that be around our data center initiatives, those are probably the biggest components of that success that we had in 2012. And really, David, I think, just having the program that we have in place inside the company and the maturity of the processes, et cetera, that we continue to focus on. So we had a great year from that standpoint. And I think when you see some of the results, when you look at our Financial segment outside of our operational effectiveness initiatives, a lot of the things we talked about that we were going to do in our check processing business, et cetera, just very focused on that. Regarding 2013, David, we continue to make solid progress here. As Jeff highlighted earlier in his comments, we're going to have that to you by the, I think, the end of the first quarter. We'll be putting those new targets out to incorporate all the integration work that we're doing in regards to the Open Solutions acquisition. That's similar to how we approached it when we did the CheckFree acquisition and we'll get those out to you probably on our first quarter call.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes. And just to add on one thing, David, I would say it's really important for us to make sure that we take into account the Open Solutions business. We don't want to just power forward without really thinking through where might there be incremental opportunities within the infrastructure of that business and the infrastructure of our business. And that's why we're taking the additional time, syncing it up with the integration planning that we're doing. But as Tom mentioned and I mentioned, we'll have some data out for you by the end of the first quarter.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","But just to clarify on that point, Jeff, I think when you gave out the 5-year cost takeout target a couple of years ago, you initially sketched out a number of about $125 million in aggregate savings for 2013. Now that you have some additional cost takeout from Open, should we expect you to preserve a number of at least $125 million?","Thomas J. Hirsch","David, we're on full track with the program that we put in place. As you know, we're ahead of where we were, but for the total, we feel very good about that over the 5-year period.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a quick housekeeping question, Tom. What was your share count as of December 31 last year?","Thomas J. Hirsch","133.4 million. See, David, actually, this time, we actually have that number for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Thanks for taking my question, many of them have already been answered, but according -- I had a couple of quick ones. According to your last 10-K, your percentage of international revenues has ticked up every year. It stood at, I think, 7% in the end of '11 versus something like 5% at the end of 2009. Can you give us an update on this part of your business? Maybe which global markets you're growing in? What offerings are driving the growth, and can we expect to see that share kind of increase at the same rate over time?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","So thanks for asking. The international business has been a priority. Obviously, it's small, as you note, relative to the rest of the company, but we do expect that to continue to grow. We've had good success in Asia, in EMEA and we'll continue to focus on opportunities that are in the wheelhouse of retail banking and channel solutions. We think those are the biggest opportunities that we have right now. We're also doing some very unique services work as it relates to working with our solutions, both on the retail and on the channel side. So those are the big drivers right now that we see opportunity in. And hopefully, later in the year, at Investor Day, we'll actually be able to give a more cohesive update on where we see the growth coming from internationally over the next several years, especially linked to our Mobiliti and channel strategies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. One last one. Given Fidelity's recent acquisition of mFoundry, are you anticipating any changing dynamics in the mobile category, increased deal competition or pricing pressure? Or do you think that changes the playing field at all?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, listen, we think that's a -- that acquisition is a great validation as to the opportunity that we've seen for several years. As we mentioned, we've gone from, in our ASP business, which we built from scratch, we have less than 1,000 ASP subscribers on January 1 of 2010 and we ended this year with a little over 830,000. So we've got a great business growing there. We expect that to actually grow materially in 2013 and that will continue to go. We think the license opportunity is actually very attractive as well. But we think the sustained value in that mobile space is really around subscription, ASP and then the integration of payments capabilities and other capabilities that allow consumers to transact, right. The beauty of mobile today is it's not just about checking bank balances in the banking world. It's about transacting and interacting and building deeper relationships with the consumers' FI. And that's what the beauty of mobile is, that's where we're focused and we think that's probably a good validation for that. As it relates to pricing and other kinds of things like that, obviously, it's too early to tell and it's an interesting market. As Mark talked about earlier, much of the market is still focused on outsource solutions. It took us a couple of years to build our -- what we think is the best ASP solution in the market and we're going to be continuing to focus on that.","Operator","Next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. You mentioned that, and I didn't get the stat quite right, that you had several years combined or the sales this year were better than the several years combined, but I wonder if you could morph that into -- in the past, you had given us the sales. This year were X percent higher than the sales last year. Did you give us that stat or could you give us that stat?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Yes, we didn't. We'll have to follow up on that. What I had said was the sales of bill payment were bigger in this year than they were in 2008, '09 and '10 combined. They were substantially larger than '11 as well but they weren't -- they were bigger than '08, '09 and '10 combined. The sales overall were -- I think we had 2 quarters that were our highest, topping our top 4 quarters ever. So we had a very strong year overall.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then my next question is on peer-to-peer payments, Popmoney generally. How do you see the market growth right now? Can you give us that percentage or something? And then how big is the total market size that you see in the next 3 years -- not, I mean, maybe 10 years out, I mean, it's much bigger but sort of the addressable market in, say, 3 years?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","Well, I mean, the addressable market is pretty significant, right, in terms of each U.S.-based household, if you just focus on the consumer side, makes over 100 person-to-person payments a year and then you have many multiples of that occurring on the B2B side and on the C2B side. So I mean, the addressable market is significant. Over the next few years, I mean, I would anticipate that as we see the ramp, right, you'll be measuring the transactions, of course, this is my opinion, I think, you'll be measuring the transactions in the millions, tens of millions plus. Over the next few years, it won't be measured in the billions but we think over time that this solution, as it captures momentum, can very likely be as large as bill payment, if not smaller because the addressable market is multiples of the size of the bill payment business itself.","Operator","Next question comes from Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Any updated thoughts on paying a dividend?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, Greg, we're very happy with the way we've allocated capital and returned value to our shareholders, as you know, over the last several years. And so we're just really pleased with what we have from a standpoint of how we're allocating capital today, using share repurchase as our capital allocation benchmark. So right now, that's kind of where we're at. It's something that we evaluate on a regular basis but right now, we're satisfied with where we're at.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then anything happening on the check processing side? Obviously, checks are declining but there's always been sort of this promise of more outsourcing occurring. Any reason to be excited there?","Thomas J. Hirsch","No. I would say the -- that business continues to decline inside but we've really had some really good efficiencies that we've created in that business, as kind of a paper to electronic imaging, et cetera, that area. But we continue to deliver that service but we don't see any large opportunities there.","Jeffery W. Yabuki","To the extent there's any good news, the decline rate is lessening because so much of the conversion has happened. It's going to continue to decline, but it's certainly not declining at the rate it was several years ago.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just the outlook for acquisitions, you've obviously got your hands full with Open but is there anything strategically that you're looking for? And any reason we should expect an acquisition more than a few hundred million dollars worth this year?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","We remain very focused on doing acquisitions that meet our kind of big 3 core strategies, core market strategies. So solutions, Channel Solutions, payments and account processing and then potentially, products that we can distribute back into the account processing base. I think for right now, we're quite focused on integrating Open Solutions. We'll continue to make sure that we look at transactions that make sense into those big 3 areas. But for right now, we're focused on executing, and that's where our head is.","Operator","Next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank Securities.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. I have a quick question regarding CashEdge revenues. I was wondering if you could provide some color on how much did CashEdge generate in 2012. And how did it compare to the $80 million guidance that you provided at the prior Analyst Day?","Thomas J. Hirsch","So we, obviously, aren't in a position to separately state those revenues. But we, I think, have said on a couple of occasions, we took some steps to make sure that we were proactively building the size of the P2P network, which is one of the main strategic rationale for buying CashEdge and that was our #1 priority. And we actually ended up saying we would give up revenue and we did give up some revenue in 2012 relative to making sure we capture the network opportunity. We remain quite bullish on the variety of products and solutions that are in that base and have actually been very excited about some of what we've seen on the aggregation side of that business, along with P2P so -- I'm sorry, as well as our small business P2P product. So lots of opportunity there. We'll continue to execute it, and we believe it will have meaningful impact over time.","Mark A. Ernst","And I think if you go back to our Investor Day presentation, I think we highlighted that also.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Just to follow up on that Popmoney correction. If you can just provide some information on the revenue model for Popmoney. Do you charge the issuing or the bank a fee per transaction? How's the revenue model? Is it a fee per transaction or is it a license fee? What are the different revenue models out there?","Jeffery W. Yabuki","It's a hosted model only, so we don't have a license offering in that product. And it varies by institution but not unlike all of the other payments, payments processing models that are out there. It's largely a transactional-based service.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And a quick one on the Open Solutions. The number that you had provided earlier, the $320 million revenue run rate, had some Fiserv eliminations also. I was wondering if you can just provide how much that amount is.","Thomas J. Hirsch","No, that includes our best estimate, including we have some existing relationships with them and a host of other things. So that's our best estimate of the run rate revenue, including that and that's the number we're providing.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And one final question, a quick housekeeping one. Down fees. Were there any down fees in fourth quarter?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, they were about in line. I think they were around $10 million or so, roughly in line with the fourth quarter last year.","Operator","Our last question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","When I look at segment organic revenue growth for 2013, is it reasonable to assume that FI will carry much of the load and then, perhaps, as we go to '14, that shifts back to payment as being the relatively faster-growing segment?","Thomas J. Hirsch","No, I think it's probably going to be the opposite way. We talked about strength in our Payments segment. I remember, Andrew, I think we disclosed this, right, we have that revenue headwind of a core account processing client that went to their parent's company's platform. So that is going to be a drag in the Financial segment as we go into '13, including some of the Bank of America in the Payments segment. But again, we have good strength, good momentum in the Payments segment. So I wouldn't necessarily clarify it like you did where the strength's going to be in the Financial.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So order of magnitude, the core client in-sourcing has a bigger impact than the BofA contract?","Thomas J. Hirsch","It's a little bit bigger, that's correct.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And if you could just rank order the growth drivers, when you look at your 3% to 4% organic revenue growth target for '13, could you rank order sort of the businesses that you see contributing to that, just qualitatively so I could understand kind of how you perform against your current expectations?","Thomas J. Hirsch","Yes, I'll start with that, and then Jeff will add to that, Andrew. But I would say, clearly, as far as driving that growth, our digital channels area, which is the online and Mobiliti areas, our debit processing business, our bill payment business, which is in -- has some good momentum coming off of a decline in 2012. And so good momentum in bill payment, those are 3 big areas, core account processing from a standpoint of continued wins in those particular areas. So I think from a high level, those would be a lot of the growth drivers. Then some of our newer innovative areas that we talked about and whether that be P2P or some of the newer products that we had, that we talked about on Investor Day a little bit.","Eric Nelson","Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We appreciate your time and support. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to call our investor relations group and we will talk to you again soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time."]}}
