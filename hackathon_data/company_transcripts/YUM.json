And welcome to the Yum! Brands Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Keith Siegner, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Strategy and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Krystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are: Greg Creed, our CEO; David Gibbs, our President and CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from Greg and David, we'll open the call to questions.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands' website, www.yum.com, to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that maybe used on today's call.","Please note the following regarding our basis of presentation for today's call. First, system sales results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Second, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and Special Items. And third, the revenue recognition accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1. As a reminder, this is a GAAP required change adjusting the timing of recognition of upfront fees received from and incentive payments made to franchisees, the effects of which have no impact on cash. In addition, it requires the gross-up of revenues and offsetting expenses of advertising funds we consolidate within our income statement.","We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.","We'd like to make you aware of the following changes in upcoming Yum! investor events. First, disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our Restricted Group capital structure will be provided at the time of the third quarter Form 10-Q filing. Second, fourth quarter earnings will be released on February 07, 2018, with the conference call on the same day. And finally, the Yum! Brands Investor and Analyst Day will be held on Wednesday, December 5, 2018 and will be available via webcast on our website at www.yum.com.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. System sales growth for the third quarter was 5% with 2% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. This achievement was largely attributable to the tremendous performance at Taco Bell as well as a solid quarter at KFC, delivering 5% and 3% same-store sales growth respectively. As well as strong net new unit growth at each brand. As a result of timing factors, we've outlined all year and consistent with our expectations for the quarter, core operating profit growth was 2%.","Now, I'd like to discuss our guidance for full year 2018. Consistent with our communications after our second quarter earnings, we anticipate net new unit growth to be at the high end of the 3% to 4% range and same-store sales growth to be at the low end of the 2% to 3% range included in our original 2018 guidance. We are also reiterating our full year core operating profit growth guidance of approximately flat. However, we have a few items to note in the pieces that comprise core operating profit.","We now anticipate our underlying base operating profit growth to be at or slightly below the low end of the previously communicated high single-digit range, owing to the reduced contribution from Pizza Hut, particularly in the international business. Offsetting this, we now anticipate the headwinds relating to the timing mismatch between refranchising and associated G&A savings to be slightly below the low end of the previously communicated six-point to seven-point range. Our estimate of a two percentage point to three percentage point headwind related to the recognition accounting standard is unchanged.","Before I begin with our key growth drivers, I want to thank and celebrate Roger Eaton for his many years of service. Roger's imprint on Yum! and the KFC brand over the last 20 years is vast. He joined KFC in 1990 and held roles in operations, development and finance across Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. before finally taking over leadership of the global KFC brand in 2014. Everyone who has met Roger knows that he always brings passion and energy enabling world-class operations to his roles, encouraging markets to adopt and share the best ideas. Roger's focus on ensuring excellence in operations, value and food innovation will leave a lasting impact for which we'll be eternally grateful.","With Roger's retirement comes a new opportunity for Tony Lowings who is being promoted to CEO of KFC Global. Tony has a long history of creating value for all of Yum!'s stakeholders having helped build one of our strongest markets, KFC Australia as well as LA&C, another KFC powerhouse. From there, he served as Managing Director, KFC Asia-Pacific, enhancing and expanding this emerging market. And finally, Tony joined KFC Global earlier this year as President and Chief Operating Officer and has provided wise counsel across Yum! through our global leadership team. We're excited for Tony and wish Roger all the very best in his retirement.","We are now two years into our three-year transformation and are continuing to execute on the key items designed to accelerate growth. The foundation of this is our four key growth drivers, which David and I will talk to you about today. I'll provide an update on two of these drivers: distinctive, relevant, and easy brands; and unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will discuss bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability along with details of our third quarter results.","I'll start with our three distinctive, relevant, and easy brands. KFC Global delivered system sales growth of 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 5%. KFC saw widespread growth including particular strength in Africa, Russia, Eastern Europe, Thailand, the Middle East, and India. The success in these markets was primarily a result of executing on value, innovation, delivery, and digital.","In particular, I want to highlight KFC India, Thailand, and Australia. India continued to deliver results with ten consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth. It has sustained momentum through a focus on value backed by noteworthy promotions. This quarter, India posted 14% same-store sales growth, supporting a year-to-date of 11%. India has opened 34 net new units this year and has rapidly become an example of our distinctive, relevant, and easy growth driver in action.","We also want to recognize Thailand. From the first quarter to the third quarter, it has improved its same-store sales growth rate by 13 points, now positive 7%. This impressive turnaround is attributable to two areas: a focus on limited time offerings built around tremendous value; and creating social media for the exciting extreme hot sauce. Like India, Thailand has had similar development success opening 39 net new restaurants through the third quarter. And last, but not least, Australia has now delivered 25 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth.","Shifting to the U.S., during the quarter, we had several examples of distinctive marketing and product innovation. First, KFC continued to be bold in their marketing as they introduced two new colonels; they started with Jason Alexander who helped promote $20 Fill Ups in four different and equally delicious options. Next, KFC partnered with the world's strongest man, Haf\u00fe\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rnsson also known as Mountain to celebrate the colossal Double Crispy Colonel sandwich by setting the record for pulling the most number of chicken sandwiches at one time. It was truly a strong effort, pun intended.","Now moving to Pizza Hut, as you have probably seen, we had a leadership change at Pizza Hut International. Vipul Chawla will be promoted to President in December. He is a talented leader and a respected global marketer. Vipul currently serves as Managing Director of Pizza Hut Asia-Pacific, our largest Pizza Hut International market with over or nearly 5,000 restaurants across 16 markets. Prior to his current role, he served as General Manager of Pizza Hut Asia. Vipul truly leads with smart heart and courage, while bringing unrelenting focus to product excellence and the customer experience. He has a proven track record of success and I know the entire Pizza Hut International system joins me in welcoming him to this new role.","Regarding the quarter, we were pleased to deliver international net new unit growth of 5%. However, we were disappointed in system sales growth of 1% owing to a same-store sales decline of 3%. We recognize that we still have work to do around same-store sales growth. We will continue to focus on operations and digital, value and spreading consistent brand messaging. And under Vipul's leadership, we're excited about the benefits to come from focusing on these essential initiatives.","Now Pizza Hut U.S., system sales declined 1% with 1% same-store sales growth and a net new unit decline of 1%. As we have consistently discussed, the Pizza Hut U.S. turnaround will be a slow build and we are encouraged by the foundation that's been put in place and continue to make strides to improve the brand's position. In the third quarter, Pizza Hut added emphasis on value: first by a continued and consistent focus on our $7.99 large two-topping pizza; second, it ran a competitive promotion offering an unbeatable value in the large two-topping pizza for just $5.99 carryout only. This value and the operational improvements have made the brand more relevant and easy.","However, the messaging has not been distinctive enough to attract new customers, which is a key focus moving forward. As we moved into fourth quarter, we've been thrilled to be the official sponsor of the NFL and about the creative opportunities this provides. Pizza Hut is also retaining a sharp focus on value as we recently kicked off our $5 Lineup featuring flavors like medium one-top pizza, Garlic Knots, wings and our new Cinnabon Mini Rolls, giving customers Pizza Hut pizzas with unrivaled everyday value and add-ons that fans will enjoy.","Now Taco Bell where system sales grew 8% with same-store sales growth of 5% and net new unit growth of 3%. With new leadership, comes new ideas and I couldn't be more proud of the Taco Bell U.S. team for improving the way they constructed the calendar in order to generate a more consistent performance and extend momentum. During the quarter, Taco Bell offered customers four unique $5 boxes, alongside innovative products like Steak Nachos, Double Cheesy Gordita Crunch and the fan favorite, Nacho Fries.","This record-breaking launch in the first quarter had customers asking for more and we were happy to bring them back. In fact, more than one in four orders contained our beloved Nacho Fries during this promotion. We picked up our movie trailer theme right where we left off with Web of Fries II: Franchise Wars. Taco Bell also connected the Nacho Fries to the 25th anniversary of the cult classic Demolition Man. In case you didn't know, in the movie Demolition Man, the only remaining restaurant is Taco Bell, which the brand celebrated with a truly unique activation at Comic-Con.","Lastly, we want to send a big congratulations to the entire Taco Bell system for ranking as America's number one favorite Mexican restaurant in the distinguished Harris Poll. Taco Bell's ability to innovate and elevate around both their marketing and products highlights the fact that the brand proudly stands in a Category of One. Internationally, this is only the beginning for Taco Bell and I'm excited to see the growth the brand grow and expand. We saw momentum and enthusiasm in India, Spain, the Philippines and Canada. Taco Bell India's year-to-date same-store sales growth is 10%, driven by the innovation such as the Naked Chicken Taco and Crispy Potaco.","In Spain, one of our more established international markets, year-to-date same-store sales growth of 6% was fueled by value innovation. Guatemala, Taco Bell's largest international market, continues to grow as it recently opened its 57th restaurant. I'm proud of the work Taco Bell International is doing to lay the groundwork for exponential growth to feed people's lives with m\u00e1s.","Now to unrivaled culture and talent, part of our transformation is ensuring that we have diverse talent and an inclusive culture to achieve greater gender parity in senior leadership, which we know generates better growth. This commitment aligns with the Paradigm for Parity coalition, to have an organization in which women and men have equal power, status and opportunity.","Yum! is intentional about diversity and this is especially evident in the leadership teams of our brands. This past month, Forbes released a series on Pizza Hut's female leaders, which highlighted the careers of five C-suite leaders. While the Forbes' article highlights Pizza Hut, we are proud of the focus on diversity and inclusion at all our brands. Here at Yum!, we are constantly cultivating great talent. It is a true competitive advantage to have a deep bench of this quality.","In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we're doing around the world, focusing on our four key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum!. We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value. And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and two of our four growth drivers, bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability.","Let's start with our third quarter results. As expected, Q3 was better than the first half. Our consolidated same-store and system sales growth rates improved reaching 2% and 5% respectively. In fact, I'd like to note that system sales growth ex-FX was 8% at Taco Bell and 7% at KFC, both impressive accomplishments. As a reminder, the following two items weighed on our third quarter core operating profit results: first, the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising; and second, the revenue recognition accounting standard change. As a result, and consistent with our expectations, core operating profit increased 2%.","I'd like to follow-up on Greg's comments related to our full year 2018 guidance and then 2019 EPS. Consistent with our communications after our second quarter earnings, we expect net new unit growth to be at the high end of the 3% to 4% range and same-store sales growth to be at the low-end of the 2% to 3% range included in our 2018 guidance. We are also reiterating our full year core operating profit growth guidance of approximately flat. Subject to a few adjustments in the components that comprise core operating profit, we now anticipate our underlying base operating profit growth to be at or slightly below the low end of the previously communicated high single-digit range owing to reduced contribution from Pizza Hut, particularly in the international business.","Offsetting this, we now anticipate the headwinds related to the timing mismatch between refranchising and the associated G&A savings to be slightly below the low end of the previously communicated six-percentage-point to seven-percentage-point range. Our estimate of a two-percentage-point to three-percentage-point headwind related to the revenue recognition accounting standard is unchanged.","Regarding our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in EPS in 2019, there have been a number of significant variables that have influenced this since we introduced it two years ago. Some of these variables are tax reform, revenue recognition, and our cash investments in Grubhub and the Pizza Hut U.S. Transformation Agreement. In addition, we have had strong performances at both KFC and Taco Bell and clearly weaker than originally anticipated performance at Pizza Hut. That said, we remain on track to deliver this goal and we plan to provide more context around 2019 during our December analyst and investor event and webcast. Lastly, as a reminder, the $3.75 target does not include any benefit from the 53rd week, the impact of changes in FX rates, nor any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment.","Now turning to our transformation initiatives, to be more focused, more franchised, and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, being more focused means, we are maniacal about our four key growth drivers as they are the key to achieving our bold aspiration of 7% system sales growth. We're confident the focus on these four capabilities is the catalyst for increasing the growth rate in our system sales over the long-term. And we're already seeing the benefits most notably in net new unit growth, which I'll talk more about shortly.","Second, we continue to make progress towards becoming more franchised, selling 134 restaurants this quarter. We are nearly 98% franchised and are on track to have less than 1,000 equity units by the end of the year. Third, we are becoming a more efficient company by reducing our CapEx and G&A spend. We are on track with 2018 CapEx guidance of $200 million to $250 million and 2019 run rate CapEx of $100 million. In addition, we expect to deliver on our G&A savings, resulting in G&A representing 1.7% of system sales in 2019.","Each of these initiatives is designed to maximize growth for our shareholders. We also remain committed to returning between $6.5 billion and $7 billion to our shareholders between 2017 and 2019. During the third quarter, we repurchased over 6 million shares for a total of $527 million and paid over $113 million in dividends. Since the beginning of 2017, we have returned over $4.3 billion to our shareholders.","Now, let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with bold restaurant development. At KFC, they again proved they are a powerhouse brand, opening nearly 270 net new units across 49 countries this quarter, demonstrating that there continues to be significant enthusiasm for capitalizing on the ample whitespace that exists for expanding this brand. This August, KFC held their inaugural Global Development Summit. With an emphasis on unlocking unit growth through data-driven market plans, franchise partner capabilities, and new asset sizes intended to unlock untapped markets, our franchise partners have many years of profitable expansion ahead. Just as encouraging, this development is occurring at the same time our franchisees upgrade and modernize existing assets.","At Pizza Hut, international delivered 5% net new unit growth over the prior year. Franchisees continue to invest in our Delco and fast casual Delco assets owing to healthy unit-level economics and cash paybacks. And these assets will represent over 90% of our net new unit openings in 2018.","One particular market that deserves special recognition is Pizza Hut Japan. It has opened 27 net new units so far this year, which is more than we opened in any of the past 15 years and has plans to open a total of approximately 100 units by 2020. Our master franchisee there is a perfect example of a 3C partner: they are committed to providing consistently bold value and successfully expanding with a delivery-based development strategy; they are capable, able to deliver a great customer experience having earned a record in customer satisfaction including a plus nine-percentage-point improvement in Pan Pizza taste; and finally, they have capital both to grow new units and modernize existing assets.","I'd like to spend a minute discussing the challenge Pizza Hut faces given its large dine-in sales mix. Specifically, the drag dine-in is having on our reported same-store sales, which masks the relative health of our delivery and carryout business. You're all aware of this headwind in the U.S. where dine-in sales are down to less than 10% of the total, but the same issue applies to our international business where dine-in sales represent approximately 50% of the total.","The gap between dine-in sales and sales from delivery and carryout is significant with both the U.S. and international seeing a roughly ten-point differential. Dine-in is waning in relevance in a lot of markets and importantly complicates pricing decisions in our ability to offer disruptive delivery value, especially in international markets with a high percentage of dine-in sales. We have a long way to go given some of the challenges in legacy dine-in markets such as Europe and China. However, the good news is the estate is shifting towards delivery\/carryout, given that 90% of net new unit openings and 80% of all replacement units are delivery\/carryout-focused.","At Taco Bell U.S., we have opened 59 net new units through the third quarter of 2018. We recently opened our 30th domestic Urban Concept which includes walk-ups and Cantinas, and are excited about the opportunity to tap this near-greenfield market. This quarter we celebrated openings in New York, Chicago and Raleigh, and look forward to more high profile openings later this year, including our first company Cantina in Manhattan. So, stay tuned.","In becoming more franchised and more focused, our refranchising initiative has fueled bold development with nearly 220 new development commitments in the U.S. through the third quarter since 2016. In international markets, Taco Bell has developed 34 net new units in 2018, with a strong fourth quarter pipeline yet to come.","Lastly, as we know, unit-level economics are essential to stimulating development. I had the privilege of attending the Taco Bell Franchise Convention last month and there's a lot of excitement especially for our Urban and Cantina models where early returns have been encouraging and the development pipeline continues to build. In aggregate, accelerating unit growth across our three brands is a driving factor as we strive for a bold aspiration of 7% system sales.","Now onto our final growth driver, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'd like to spend a minute highlighting our partnership with Grubhub. At the beginning of the year, we announced our partnership with Grubhub to drive sales to KFC and Taco Bell through online ordering for pickup and delivery. We are pleased to share that 1,200 KFC restaurants now will offer delivery through Grubhub covering 30% of the U.S. system in just seven months. We are seeing above-average customer ratings on the Grubhub KFC experience and expect this to improve once POS integration is complete later this year.","As per Taco Bell, in September we launched a fully integrated solution between the Taco Bell POS and Grubhub marketplace, rolling out this integrated delivery solution to over 2,100 stores across the nation covering 30% of the U.S. market. We are adding stores at a rapid rate and expect to make healthy headway through the end of the year. We have seen positive early results along with valuable operations learnings. Franchisees are very excited about delivery as an opportunity to drive incremental sales and are all in on delivery as a major brand initiative.","Wrapping up on Grubhub, while we are in very early stages of our partnership, the check growth and incrementality of sales that we see is encouraging and supporting expansion throughout the franchise systems.","To wrap-up, our third quarter operating profit results were as we expected. We remain confident in delivering on our transformation initiatives and while there may be noise between quarters, we are pleased with the progress to-date.","Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","John, are you there? You might be on mute.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Sorry about that guys. The question was on Pizza Hut. Obviously, looking at the U.S. and the Transformation Agreement that's been put into place there, it does seem like you're identifying that many of your bigger international markets are having the similar type of issues that the U.S. was having a year or so ago in terms of what products are promoted at what price and basically serving the dining store versus the Delco store. So, are we now beginning a position or are you alluding to that maybe some of the international markets need some of the capital and operating costs and attention that the U.S. was really talked about about a year or so ago?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, John, I think one important difference between the U.S. and international is our international dine-in stores are actually in fairly good shape. These are good assets in good locations and in many countries we actually have a very strong dine-in business that we have confidence in for the future. That's quite a contrast to the U.S. where we have a lot of Red Roof restaurants that are in the wrong part of the trade area, haven't been remodeled and clearly need to go away. So there's a lot of capital required to get out of the Red Roof restaurants in the U.S. It's not a similar situation internationally. So no, we don't anticipate any kind of capital investment needs from Yum! going into international dine-in business.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And is there \u2013 I mean, I guess, a similar type of conversion opportunity over time, even if the assets are in good shape that makes them actually easier to convert, to integrate some of the Delco or fast casual type developments within the existing Red Roof type or a full-service type of estate that exists internationally. I mean, are we at the point where not just 90% of new units are Delcos but you need to begin to convert many of those legacy assets over to something that is more flexible for the overall business model?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, that's exactly right. I think I shared 80% of the stores are \u2013 that are being replaced, so when we have a dine-in unit that does need to be replaced it is being replaced with one of the fast casual or Delco assets. We think this transition will occur, it won't happen overnight but it is planned to occur over time. And with half of our sales coming \u2013 roughly half of our sales coming from dine-in today, we think that number will be closer to a quarter of our sales within three to four years, just from the natural shift of, for example, closing on the Telepizza deal, adding all of those delivery sales, building all these net new unit Delcos that are in the pipeline and then all the work that's being done to replace dine-in stores with delivery stores.","So we want to give everybody the clear signal that we do have a plan to migrate out of those dine-in stores, but we thought it was important to highlight frankly that the delivery carryout business at Pizza Hut International is actually fairly healthy. That business is doing well, but the results we report don't show the success that we're having in that part of the business.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Thank you. My question is on the core operating profit guide. I know the guidance update today was just based on 2018. As I look at the refranchising and the G&A savings benefit that's more of a timing mismatch that would have worked itself out anyway. Are you concerned that the underlying issues of Pizza Hut International would impair the core operating profit growth over the longer term? Or do you think that those issues are more just isolated to this year?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think the beauty of Yum! obviously is that we do have a diverse portfolio of brands and countries. And yes, the Pizza Hut business is underperforming our expectations when we started this transformation journey. But obviously, we're also seeing great strength at the much bigger parts of our business at Taco Bell and KFC and we did reiterate our guidance for 2019 today. So I think you never get there the way you planned when you start the journey and we'll talk more about this when we get to December Analyst Day. But we feel good about the state of the business. Obviously, the results this quarter and the fact that we are very demonstrably ramping up net new-unit development certainly helps this earnings model of ours.","Just as another fact on that front, year-to-date now we have 892 net new units opened for the year compared to 2017. At the same point, we had 677, so we're 215 units ahead of the pace we had last year. Remember last year we were well ahead of the pace from the prior year, so that's all quite positive and typically the fourth quarter of the year is the biggest year on development by far. So a good story on the development front that helps the earnings model.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I'll ask my follow-up first and then I'll ask my question. The follow-up is on Pizza Hut U.S., I know you said the turnarounds are slow build, but I think this is the second quarter where you said maybe the messaging wasn't as effective even though you did pivot to value. So, could you talk about what can be done here? Because as you noted this isn't a dine-in issue since that's such a small piece of the business in the U.S. at this point. So, I guess, what is the strategy from here if really the only issue is messaging? And then I have a second question.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Look if I answer it in its totality, we're now the NFL partner. It's with us and not a competitor. Is that a good thing? Yes it is. We know what the right price points are to be successful in the marketplace. Do we have all of our franchisees on those price points right yet? No, we don't. But are the stores that are on the right price points doing better? Yes, they are. And as we said, I personally feel that we just got to do a better job of communicating this compelling value. We've got a new agency, they're onboard, the team is all over it and I think you will see us going forward with what I'll call sharper and more distinctive advertising and communication around this compelling value that we offer.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, and just one thing to add on that although the dine-in sales in the Pizza Hut U.S. business are only 10% of the business or so, remember about half the assets are dine-in assets. Those assets are very often in the wrong part of the trade area to deliver, they're not set up in the back of house to deliver. So, although the sales mix is now down to a much more manageable level, we still have work to do that should give you confidence over time. Once we move those assets we'll be in a much better shape.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning. David just going back to the 2019 comments, do you believe 2019 is a year you can still deliver on the high single-digit operating profit growth? Are you signaling that there are different pieces you get to the EPS number, but maybe not the operating profit number you'd once envisioned? And related to that I think your G&A on a percentage of system sales is at your target rate of 1.7% this quarter, so is this the right sort of baseline to think about G&A and then it grows in line with system sales from here, are there additional opportunities you've identified as you've gone through this year?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Look I think, we'll talk a lot more about 2019 guidance when we get to the December analyst event. But we weren't trying to imply that there was any change to our high single-digit core operating profit growth model in future years with any of the comments today. The business and the models all generally remain intact, but we'll provide a lot more color on that when we get to the December event.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Just a follow-up on Pizza Hut, since KFC and Taco Bell seem to be cranking along here. The U.S. business, you've invested a lot this year and obviously to this point you're going to have the big fall push here with the NFL. But to this point, the momentum has not been as strong. You mention creative, but next year you're going to be lapping some of those investments. Do you feel like that this is in a fragile position where you really got to get brand momentum going here in the near-term to start to lap some of those investments? I mean, how should we think about the state of Pizza Hut U.S. heading into the 2019 in particular?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Dave, the way I think about it is that the foundations of Pizza Hut U.S. are in a much better place. I think our delivery times, the quality of the food we're delivering, the price points, all of those are fundamentally in a better place. So our foundations are definitely in a better place. Have we made it easier for our customers to access? Yes, we have through both digital, through both our apps, through the pricing. The point I was making and I think it's one that the team is very aware of is that we have to bring that sort of sharpness of what we're now delivering and doing so we attract new customers.","I think our current customer base is very happy with the foundational improvements they're seeing in the brand. The opportunity for us is to bring in new customers by communicating and messaging better this compelling new proposition that Pizza Hut U.S. has to offer, which is an operating improvement, an ease improvement, a value improvement. We just got to do a better job of communicating that and I'm confident that once we do do that and when customers have a new Pizza Hut experience they'll be very happy with the experience that they have.","And on that basis, I feel good about the momentum that the (37:06) as David said earlier, our performance in delivery and carryout is better than our overall performance. So have we got work to do? Yes. The foundation is in place? Yes. Can we do a better job of communicating? Yes. And we know what the task is and when you know what the task is, you go chase it and you deliver it.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","On the question of lapping, all of the transformation initiatives were really designed to help the business for the long-term. There really isn't a lapping issue. We invested in media. You'd think that could be a lapping issue, but that was done so that then the franchisees ongoing contribution in media would jump up. So we will have that additional media in future years, so there's \u2013 it's not like that creates a lap issue and then the other investments in things like pouches, and different standards for the brands, launching the loyalty program, we should continue to reap the benefit of those investments over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS.","Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning and thanks for the question. David just wondering, if you could talk a bit more about the accelerated unit growth potential for the business going forward. Maybe following another strong quarter at KFC, maybe specifically about your confidence in the accelerated growth there, generally which reasons you see that coming from. And just how you're thinking about the U.S. getting back to positive based on the strong returns that the franchisees are seeing? Thanks.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, look again, we'll go into a lot of the future guidance and we'll actually have the leaders from each of the brands talk about their development plans when we get to the December analyst event. I think I want to celebrate the fact that we've made meaningful progress to-date during this transformation as we've been doing all these things like cutting G&A and getting the business more focused. We're starting to see the benefit from development. It's showing up in the numbers, which is why I'm trying to highlight that every quarter.","Do we think \u2013 and are we pushing to take the numbers higher from here? Yes. Do we think there are opportunities in almost every market whether they be the mature markets in the U.S. or the international markets? Yes. KFC U.S. is very focused on getting to be a positive net new unit grower. And just as a preview, I think we can get them there next year. So, yeah, that is something that's really quite additive to the model, when you think about how many units they've been closing over time.","But yes, we're excited about unit growth. We'll never stop pushing for more, because when the returns are healthy, you should be capitalizing that and building more and the franchisees love it. It's a way for them to grow their business. But we'll give you even more color on that when we get to December.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Just a question broadly on the franchisee health and profitability, I'm not sure whether you can slice it U.S. versus international, but however you look at it. I mean in the past you used to use restaurant margin as a proxy for the franchisees' health and profit, but obviously that margin is no longer representative as the base is so small. So, just wondering if you can offer any directional thoughts on the franchisee health at each brand, maybe how you're suggesting they best manage through the labor cost headwinds they're presumably all facing, and whether or not any of them have concerns about access to capital with rising interest rates? Thank you.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, that's true Jeff that now we \u2013 you really can't judge the margins that we report and use that as a proxy for the franchise unit economics since we're down to some small numbers with a lot of noise in them. I guess, a general comment on franchisee health is when you operate in as many different combinations of brands and countries as we do there are always pockets of issues. We got 2,000 franchisees. There is always going to be some that are having challenges that we're working with, but the vast majority of our franchise system around the world is quite healthy.","The areas where we would have more issues that you would expect would be in businesses where we're trying to transform the business a little bit like Pizza Hut U.S. We're trying to make sure we have the healthiest system of franchisees that we can. Some of the stuff we did in the Transformation Agreement was designed to give us some strength to manage out our underperforming franchisees.","And you may see some change in the franchise system there. But in general, I think our franchise health around the world is quite good, and the unit returns that we're reporting are strong. You heard Yum! China yesterday on their earnings call talk about two-year cash paybacks on brand new KFC, so that kind of thing at least to help new franchisees.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. My question is on Taco Bell, which did have impressive performance in Q3. And I just wanted to see if you would elaborate on the drivers of that and whether the reintroduction of Nacho Fries had a big impact on that or whether you think there's something more structural or sustainable that you have that's driving that trend? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think Taco Bell is just doing everything really well. Obviously to report 5% system sales growth, the calendar was incredibly strong. The team adjusted the calendar, which I was really proud of. The fact that they weren't happy with how they got out of the gate, so they adjusted the calendar. I think the product innovation continues to be world class. I still believe that there's no better product innovation that comes out \u2013 that doesn't come out from Taco Bell.","The restaurants are being incredibly well-run. The value price points are spot on. The communication is distinctive and cut through. And to the delivered system sales growth of 8%, that is really at the top end, definitely the top end of what happened in the Mexican category and I would argue at the top end of what's happened in QSR.","And then, I guess, to top it all off, the prestigious Harris Poll to make Taco Bell the number one Mexican brand in the country was I think just the icing on the cake. So I think this brand is set up for continued success.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel.","Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I had a follow-up to a prior question and then a second. David just going back to your Pizza Hut comment, is there a compelling financial argument that could be made for the company to increase its support to accelerate the Pizza Hut conversions?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I think we've done a lot to support the franchisees as we move out of the dine-in asset base into the delivery base. By compelling arguments, there are some incentives that we've done to do that, that we haven't talked about a lot on these calls. So I think we've looked at those things and we've worked with the franchise community to help support them in that regard. Remember that, building a new delivery carryout unit is a very good economic proposition in general. It's a low-cost investment and it generates a three, four year cash payback in general. So the economics are there to make it happen, but when you're dealing with over 3,000 dine-in restaurants it's just going to take some time.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks, operator. We'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just two questions, one on KFC and one on Pizza Hut. On KFC same-store sales accelerated there particularly on a two-year basis, so super strong performance there. I know we had Yum! China's comps last night, but what's driving the improvement elsewhere at KFC? Is the momentum of delivery growth in some of these markets really gaining momentum? Or anything else you can point out there. And just on Pizza Hut, the $5 lineup you announced, is this a sustainable value offering, are franchisees able to operate at this price point? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, yeah, I think as I said the KFC performance and the acceleration is down to a number of things: great value, delivery, digital, very good execution and as we said in the commentary, it's widespread. We've had really good across-the-board performance in the quarter from KFC. So what I liked about it was geographically this was a really strong across-the-board sort of quarter.","So I think they're doing all the things right. Value is great, delivery, digital and really good execution focusing on the core, and they're doing that across a broad range of markets and we're seeing the benefit.","And then on your question on the $5 lineup, yes, it is sustainable. It's been designed to be sustainable. And even the things that, I'm not going to talk about that are coming out, that will go on the menu in the future are also designed to sustain the $5 price point. So I feel very good. We've got the right price points, we communicated in a compelling way and we will see an improvement in Pizza Hut U.S.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Okay. So first of all, I just want to thank everyone for being on the call today. We remain confident that we are going to deliver on our transformation to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient, all of which will deliver more growth. Q3 was a strong quarter. We obviously have work to do on the top line at Pizza Hut International, but I am happy with their new-unit development.","However, it is great that two of our brands which represent over 80% of our operating profits are delivering on all four of our key growth drivers. The high single-digit system sales growth at both Taco Bell and KFC was impressive I think by any standard. And we look forward to discussing this more in December and thank you for being on the call with us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Following remarks from each, we will take your questions.Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Novak.David NovakThank you Tim and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. This is clearly an interesting and challenging time for Yum! Brands immediately following another year of at least 13% earnings per share growth, excluding special items during 2012. This markets the 11th consecutive year we exceeded our annual target of at least 10% which puts us in an elite group of high growth companies. Our 2012 highlight was setting a record for international new unit development which will strengthen our foundation for even more long term growth. In fact, we opened nearly 2000 units outside the United States as well as positioning the United States business for more consistent returns. Overall, there is no question in our mind that our organizational capability is stronger than our and our long term growth opportunities have never been better. However, I know for sure, the issue that the forefront of everybody\u2019s mind is what's going on with China and the government\u2019s recent review of China\u2019s poultry supply, and the corresponding sharp sales decline that began in our KFC business during the last two weeks of December.Today, we want to provide some additional color around how it has impacted our business and how we plan to restore confidence with our customers and get them back into our restaurants. But first here is what happened. There was an investigative report broadcast on a program similar to 60 Minutes by Chinese Central Television, CCTV. That\u2019s a Chinese state owned enterprise which aired on December 18, 2012. It was carried throughout China and was clearly linked to the KFC brand. The report showed that a few poultry farmers were ignoring laws and regulations by using excessive levels of antibiotics in chicken. Regrettably, some of this product was purchased by two poultry suppliers of KFC China.The CCTV story led to an investigation by the Shanghai FDA which caused future media attention, intensifying negative, sensationalized social media commentary. These events significantly impacted consumer confidence in KFC. This onslaught of negative media coverage have been longer lasting and more impactful then we ever imagined, lasting over six weeks. The media coverage is beginning to wind down because on January 21 of this year, the Shanghai FDA reported it\u2019s concluding findings of the investigation. The Shanghai FDA identified issues and provided supervisory recommendations to Yum! China to strengthen our poultry supply chain practices including improved voluntary self-testing procedures, improved reporting and communications, and enhanced supplier management.It is important to note that the Shanghai FDA did not bring a case against Yum! China and no fines were assessed. We have whole-heartedly accepted these recommendations and appreciate the thorough review by the Shanghai FDA. Now hindsight is always 20\/20 and history is only good for two things. First, to learn from it, and second, to inspire your belief about what can be done in the future. We are applying our learnings and findings from the Shanghai FDA to further strengthen our QA processes. Our customers expect high quality safe food and they feel that we have let them down. To restore consumer confidence in KFC, we will launch an enhanced product quality assurance program along with an aggressive marketing campaign shortly after the Chinese New Year.Now looking back, history gives us confidence that we have the capability to fully recover and grow. We have faced SARS, avian flu, Sudan Red, and in every case we have bounced back. As an example, in 2005, when our China business was severely impacted by Sudan Red and avian flu, our same-store sales in KFC China were down as much as 40% during the crisis. Our full year operating profit was down 5% but we stayed the course and kept building new units. In 2006, we bounced back and reported systems sales growth of 28% and our profits grew 47%.I think this demonstrates the historical resilience of the brand. Now no two crises are the same and we don\u2019t know how long it will take us to recover. However, we expect to weather this storm and come out stronger. So let me be very clear. We will stay the course in China. We will continue to grow the business with leading brands in every significant category. We will continue to build our two big brands, KFC and Pizza Casual Dining and we will continue to invest behind Pizza Hut Home Service, Little Sheep and East Dawning. Our new unit targets remain unchanged.Now Pat Grismer will give you more color around our near-term sales expectations and our underlying assumptions in a moment. However, because our China business accounted for 42% of our profits last year and because it\u2019s clear it will take time for sales to recover, there is no question due to the sustained sharp decline in KFC China sales, we will fall well short of our targeted growth of at least 10% earnings per share growth in 2013. In fact, under our current broad assumptions, we estimate a mid-single digit EPS decline in 2013. We obviously hope to do better, faster.Putting our current short term China sales issue aside, we will continue to build shareholder value by aggressively developing new units around the world, driving same store sales growth and generating high returns on invested capital. At Yum! Restaurants International India and the United States businesses, we are well positioned to deliver against our operating profit targets and drive future growth in the years to come. I am confident our China business will bounce back strongly and lead the way to restoring our track record of double digit EPS growth in 2014, 2015 and beyond.So now let me turn it over to Rick who\u2019s going to further outline the highlights of Yum! Restaurants International and our U.S business.Richard CarucciThank you David and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to focus both of my comments today around why we believe that Yum! Restaurants International and our U.S businesses are well positioned for a successful 2013.Let me start with YRI, the division that is 90% franchised and it generates nearly half of Yum!\u2019s valuable $1.8 billion annual royalty stream. I am optimistic that YRI will have a strong 2013. We should benefit from strong development momentum from reaching scale in some key markets and from some improvements in our ownership portfolio. Overall, we are poised to capitalize on our advantage of being the global restaurant leader in emerging markets.First, let\u2019s address developments. During 2012, YRI developed a record 949 units with over 65% of them in emerging markets. We\u2019ll continue our rapid expansion in 2013 and hope to set a new record by building over 950 new units. These new units built in 2012 and 2013 should provide about 5 points of proper growth for YRI in 2013.One of the characteristics of Yum! is its strength in emerging markets. As a company, we relish the joint challenge of delivering in the short term while building for the long term. This is true in YRI\u2019s approach to emerging markets where our goal is to continually improve our foundation for future growth while also growing the business year after year. In 2012, the emerging markets grew system sales 12% including 7% new unit growth. In 2013, we are targeting similar growth building an even stronger foundation.I\u2019ll use Russia and Africa to provide some brief examples of what I mean by this. Russia is a market with huge potential. For the past two years, Russia has had the highest same store sales growth out of our 20 business units around the world. System sales grew 46% in 2012 and we opened nearly 40 new restaurants. Some of these are now company owned and are yielding good returns.After buying the business in 2010, we have converted nearly all the Rosticks units to KFC. When you look at the new branding and consider the quality of the people we have added to the Russian team, we believe that our business isn\u2019t only getting bigger, it\u2019s getting better. We\u2019re gaining more and more confidence that Russia can become a sizeable, high profit business for YRI.Let\u2019s move on to Africa, a continent with endless possibilities. As Micky Pant said in New York, Africa could become the next powerhouse economy in the world. Africa has over 1 billion people and we currently have nearly 1,000 restaurants there. That\u2019s less than one restaurant per million people compared to our 58 restaurants per million people in the U.S.During 2012, we opened almost 50 restaurants and ended the year with restaurants in 14 countries. We intend to further expand across Africa in 2013 by building restaurants in Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. By the way, these three countries combined have a population of about 90 million people. At the same time, we expect to grow our core business in South Africa where we have about 690 KFC restaurants today.Our breakfast expansion is doing great as we now have more than 270 restaurants offering breakfast and plan to add another 100 restaurants this year. Africa is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing regions, and KFC plans to be the clear restaurant leader on the continent. We are also building scale in some very large developed markets where our concepts today are significantly underpenetrated. For example we have been working hard over the past decade to reach scale in France and Germany. We have about 150 KFCs in France and about 100 KFC in Germany. We know that we have a long way to go because McDonalds has over 2500 restaurants in these two countries.However the good news for us is that we are now large enough to advertise in both countries. In France, we already have our highest average unit volumes in the world at $3.5 million a year. The France team hopes to increase this level by increasing the televised advertising from 20 weeks to 32 weeks in 2013. Germany now has enough KFC presence to justify national televised advertising for the first time. To give some perspective, when France began national advertising their sales went up over 10%. We expect strong results this year from France and Germany and together they can help drive meaningful growth for YRI in 2013 and beyond.Over the years, Yum! has always sought to improve its company ownership portfolio and the evolution of this portfolio has been an important part of our success. We sold our Pizza Hut UK Diner business to a strong franchise partner late last year. While consistent with our ownership strategy, this move also has the benefit of improving YRI profits in 2013. I am very pleased to announced today that we recently agreed the terms to acquire the operations of our franchise partner in Turkey. Turkey is another high growth emerging market with a population of 75 million people. This population is mostly urban and the median age is 29 years old. Today, Yum! has about 100 restaurants in Turkey, 60 KFCs and 40 Pizza Huts.This acquisition is subject to Turkish competition approval but is expected to close by the end of March. I thank our Turkey franchisee and our [Divine] Dallas based YRI teams for their efforts in developing this market and reaching this agreement. This transaction advances our strategy to increase the ownership in high growth, high return businesses and helps solidify our leadership in emerging markets.Overall, the Yum! Restaurant international business is on track. We had a solid 2012 and expect another year of strong performance. Our strategy remains to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere.Now on to the United States. The U.S. as you know is an extremely competitive QSR market, where you have to play your A game every day. While the economy is certainly not robust, it is strong enough to control our own destiny. We believe that the U.S. is set up for success in 2013 because Taco Bell has momentum, because new units are now working in our favor, and because we have meaningful innovation plans at all three of our brands.Our three U.S. businesses are significantly stronger now than they were a year ago. At Taco Bell what a difference a year can make. During 2012, Taco Bell sold 325 million Doritos and Locos Tacos. That\u2019s more Tacos than there are people in the United States and makes it one of the most successful product launches in QSR history. Cantina Bell was also created in 2012 inspired by celebrity chef, Lorena Garcia. This has helped broaden the Taco Bell brand beyond its core user. I hope you all enjoyed the Taco Bell commercial during the Super Bowl which showed the country that you are never too old to live [much]. We know from our almost 10 million Facebook fans and from comments on social media, that Taco Bell is a beloved and much talked about brand today.What's important is that our 2012 Taco Bell successes should pay dividends again in 2013. Cool Ranch Doritos, Locos Tacos will be introduced in March and Cantina Bell innovation is also coming. All of this will be backed with solid operations and more media [weight]. As you heard in New York in a couple of months ago, Taco Bell aligned with their franchise system to reallocate local media to national media which resulted in more efficient advertising. For the U.S to have a successful year, it is important for our most profitable U.S brands to have a successful year and we believe we have a lot of things going in our favor at Taco Bell.Taco Bell is also following Pizza Hut\u2019s lead in going after more rural new units. The combination of a new smaller building asset design and a franchisee rural incentive should provide Taco Bell with more new units by 2014.We are also very proud that Pizza Hut added 150 net new units in the United States last year. This marks the second consecutive year of positive net unit growth after a decade of decline. The pizza brand is positioned to add a similar number of new units in 2013, given the low investment cost and high returns of our Delco Lite units. It is great to see that new unit growth is now positively contributing to our ability to grow U.S sales and profits.In the quick service restaurant business, you need value and innovation to succeed. While I talked about some of the innovation at Taco Bell, I would rather not go into much detail at Pizza Hut and KFC for competitive reasons. However, I will tell you that I believe we will have strong innovation at both Pizza Hut and KFC during 2013. I will also provide one example of product news today. Get ready for the launch of pizza sliders this week. Like burger sliders, this smaller pizza product has the potential to add new occasions to our brands. We will initially sell them in packages of three sliders and nine sliders and once consumers buy the product they will be hooked. I believe that the product will exceed our customer\u2019s expectations of quality and value.Any way you look at it, 2012 was a banner year for our U.S business. Same store sales grew 5%. Margins improved by over 4 points and operating profit grew 13%. All three brands grew same store sales. Profits grew at all three brands, with very significant profit growth at Taco Bell and KFC. However, we recognize that 2013 is an important test for us. We have said that we have positioned our businesses for more consistent results and we look forward to demonstrating that we can back up a strong year of performance in 2012 with another one 2013.Now let me hand things over to Pat Grismer, our CFO.Patrick GrismerThank you, Rick. I\u2019m pleased that 2012 marked the 11th straight year we delivered at least 13% EPS growth before special items. I\u2019m also very happy with the quality of that growth as it was largely driven by positive same store sales growth and strong operating profit performance from each of our major divisions. I\u2019m even more excited about the progress we made with new unit development as we not only set a new record for international store openings, laying a strong foundation for future growth, but also achieved positive net unit results in the U.S for the first time in over 10 years.Additionally, we returned over $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders in 2012, including nearly $1 billion in share repurchases and the eighth consecutive annual double digit percentage increase in our dividend rate. We take great pride in each one of these accomplishments as they individually drive shareholder returns. More importantly, these accomplishments collectively demonstrate the confidence we have in our ability to sustain double digit growth over the long term despite the setback we will experience in 2013 due to the current sales situation in China.Today, I\u2019ll share my thoughts on three key items. Our 2012 fourth quarter and full year results, our updated outlook for 2013 and finally, actions we\u2019re taking to drive long-term growth. First, our fourth quarter results. During the quarter, we delivered 10% EPS growth excluding special items. Adjusting for the additional week in our 2011 fiscal calendar which provided a $26 million operating profit benefit to Yum! Restaurants International and the U.S combined, we achieved 16% EPS growth on a like-for-like basis despite a very challenging quarter for our China business.I will first make a few brief remarks on the fourth quarter performance of our YRI and U.S businesses and then go into detail in China. Yum! Restaurants International had a solid quarter, opening a record 473 new units including 309 new units in emerging markets. Same store sales grew 3% with broad-based growth across our portfolio with the exceptions of continental Europe and Japan where same-store sales were generally soft. We were especially pleased with very strong same-store sales growth in Russia, Africa, Thailand and our Pizza Hut business in Korea. This new unit development and same store sales growth led to operating profit growth of 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of our 53rd week in 2011.Fourth quarter results included an $8 million insurance recovery related to Thailand flooding in 2011, which partially offset $11 million of closed store expense related to the re-franchising of our Pizza Hut UK dining business. Moving to the U.S., we had another strong quarter with 3% same store sales growth and margin improvement of 3 percentage points. Excluding the impact of our 53rd week benefit from 2011, U.S. operating profit grew 5% versus prior year. The fourth quarter kept an absolutely outstanding year for Taco Bell with same store sales up 5% and restaurant margin up 2 percentage points.Additionally we made very good progress with our U.S. development strategy increasing our unit counts by about 100 Pizza Huts and 15 Taco Bells during the fourth quarter alone. With improved unit level economics and our new ownership strategy, our U.S. business is now firmly positioned for more consistent profit growth in the years ahead.And now China. China operating profit declined 5% for the fourth quarter prior to foreign currency translation, driven by a 6% decrease in same store sales. Given the importance of this business measure, I would like to describe how China\u2019s same store sales evolved over the course of Q4. As a reminder, China\u2019s fourth quarter encompasses four months, September through December. For the month of September, same store sales were positive for both KFC and Pizza Hut. Despite a positive start to October, both brands posted negative results for the month in the face of increasingly difficult prior year comparables and a weakening retail environment.In November, Pizza Hut responded well to a signature promotion and turned moderately positive. But KFCs slowing trend continued from October. These trends continued into the month of December. And then KFC turned sharply negative as the events unfolded in the last two weeks of the month. Our 6% same store sales decline for the quarter was composed of KFC down 8% and Pizza Hut up 7%. For the fourth quarter, China restaurant margin declined 1.9 percentage points, primarily due to KFCs sharp sales decline during the last two weeks of December as well as the dilutive impact of accelerated new unit development over the year.On the subject of development, China had another exceptional quarter opening 369 restaurants. That\u2019s nearly 3 restaurant openings per day. For the full year, China opened a record 889 new units will almost half of these new units built in rapidly growing tier 3 to tier 6 cities. Our new unit development program demonstrates our strong belief in China\u2019s long term growth potential and our confidence in the capability of our China team to create significant share holder value through these investments.Now our full year results. This year\u2019s EPS growth of 13% excluding special items was driven by quality growth from all three major divisions, China, YRI, and the U.S. Each division had same store sales growth for the year and we built a record 1,976 new international units. Something we are very proud of is strong operating profit performance from each of our major divisions which drove 12 points of EPS growth. The strong performance at YRI and the outperformance in the U.S. offset the fact that we had lower than expected performance in our China division in 2012.This demonstrates the unique power of our Yum! portfolio with three global brands covering a diverse set of geographies with particular strength in emerging markets which collectively account for about 60% of our operating profit. Our overall business model is further strengthened by the $1.8 billion pretax royalty stream we generated last year, providing steady cash flow that enables ongoing investment in growth initiatives. Once our China sales rebound, we expect these unique characteristics of Yum! Brands will again support earnings growth consistency in the years ahead.As KFC China\u2019s significantly negative same store sales have continued into the New Year, our 2013 results will be significantly impacted. So let me provide you with an update on our China sales and outlook for 2013.Because we cannot predict how long it will take for KFC China sales for recover, we hesitate to provide specific financial guidance for 2013. Instead, we\u2019ll estimate 2013 results based on broad assumptions. To be clear, based on the strength of our KFC brand equity in China and based on the demonstrated resilience of our brands over time, we do expect these sales to recover. However, we simply cannot predict the recovery period with a high degree of accuracy.As you saw in our release, we estimate that our January same store sales declined 41% at KFC and 15% at pizza casual dining in China. We estimate the timing of Chinese New Year had a negative mid teen impact on January same store sales growth for our China division. We expect this negative impact of Chinese New Year to reverse in February. So assuming no change to current trends, that is no improvement in seasonally adjusted KFC China sales through the end of February and given the effect of the Chinese New Year holiday shift, we estimate that China divisions same store sales will decline by about 25% for the first quarter, with KFC significantly negative and pizza casual dining about flat.Remember, China\u2019s first quarter is composed of January and February alone and the Chinese New Year is a seasonally strong period for our business. Last year, Chinese New Year started on January 23rd whereas this year it will start February 10th.Given the uncertainty of KFC sales recovery in China, we plan to release China monthly same store sales until KFC recovers. We will begin this process with February sales which we expect to report on March 11th.This brings me to our earnings expectations for the first quarter. Even though we expect solid results from our U.S and YRI businesses in Q1, the significant decline in China same store sales will weigh very heavily on EPS growth. For the first quarter, we estimate that EPS will decline approximately 25% before special items. As you\u2019d expect, we are very disappointed with this result, but we view this as a temporary setback from which we will ultimately recover strongly.Now let me share my expectations for full year EPS. Our portfolio of businesses collectively modeled 13% annual EPS growth, including 7 percentage points from China, 3% from YRI, 1% to 2% from the U.S and 2% from financial strategies. As I mentioned earlier, our franchise business model primarily driven by our YRI and U.S businesses, contributes a steady source of cash flow of around 41.8 billion a year and we remain confident that these businesses will achieve their growth targets. If you add it up, our model delivers 6% to 7% EPS growth excluding China.Now, due to the sustained sharp decline in KFC China sales, we will fall well short of our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth in 2013. Although my confidence in our China team and the growth potential of our KFC China business is undiminished, it is difficult to predict how long sales recovery will take. Assuming that KFC China sales improve gradually throughout the year and will be positive in the fourth quarter, we estimate that China restaurant margin will be in the mid-teens and that China operating profit will be negative versus prior year. Importantly, we will stay the course in our China strategy, including investments in new unit development as we build leading brands in every significant category.Taking all of this into account, we estimate a mid-single digit EPS decline in 2013 versus prior year. Obviously, this is very disappointing news for all of us but we view 2013 as an aberration, and we are confident that we will rebound strongly with time. We are confident because we have endured setbacks before. Dave had already mentioned how in 2006 we rebounded strongly from a sharp sales decline in China in 2005. Additionally, we saw Taco Bell bounce back strongly in 2012 following a very weak 2011 affected by a bogus lawsuit and a sensational media attention that followed.Taco Bell\u2019s sales and profit resurgence in 2012 clearly demonstrate that in time, innovation and intentionality can return a brand to greatness. It\u2019s also important to note that new unit development will help to sustain the growth of our China business despite the temporary setback in same store sales. We added 889 units in 2012 and we expect to open at least 700 new units in 2013 as we indicated at our investor conference in New York. If you assumed we will add another 700 units in 2014, the 2014 impact at all this new unit development alone will add about $2 billion to our current China systems sales, or an increase of about 25%.While it is way too early to know what will happen to same store sales or margin levels in 2014, it sure is good to know that the China development engine will help to blunt the impact of the same store sales decline we will experience in 2013. Finally, let me talk about the actions we are taking to drive our long term business model including our continued focus on new unit development.First, as in any year, our primary focus is building shareholder value so we will continue to invest behind future growth opportunities. We are staying the course and will not change how we grow our businesses while doing everything possible to reverse the negative sales trends with KFC in China. Although this will be a very challenging year for Yum!, we will make the right decisions for our business long term. What we will not do is sacrifice our long term growth model in an effort to make one year\u2019s bad EPS number a little bit better.Our growth model is driven by new unit development, same store sales growth and high returns. We are staying the course with our long term growth strategy and will continue to use excess cash to invest behind the growth we see in the business and then return all remaining cash through dividends and share purchases. Our investment in new unit development is skewed towards high growth emerging markets such as China, India, Russia and Africa. And we will use 2013 to further strengthen our foundation in all of these markets including China.We continue to believe that China is the number one retail opportunity in the world and we will continue to capitalize on this growth opportunity. However, as outlined at our December investor conference, we are shifting our China development focus towards lower tier cities where restaurant margins and investment returns are higher. In our India division, we built 138 new units this year, in including 80 KFCs. This is the second year in a row we have built over 100 new units and we expect that number to grow as we build even more people capability in India. We will continue to invest behind our powerful brands in India and we expect this business to be the next big growth engine for Yum! within the next two to three years.At YRI, we will invest behind high growth markets and accelerate new unit development of both KFC and Pizza Hut, particularly in the rapidly growing Pizza delivery space. And finally, driven by the powerful economics of our Pizza Hut Delco Lite and the improved returns on Taco Bell units, we expect that units in the U.S. will be net unit positive again in 2013. In conclusion, we realize 2013 will be a very challenging year for Yum! But our brands are resilient and I am confident that KFCs sales will recover in China as we rebuild consumers trust in our brand. Despite this setback our growth model remains intact and is designed to deliver double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.And with that I will turn it back over to Dave.David NovakOkay. Thank you very much, Pat, appreciate it. So let me wrap up leaving you with our three key messages. Number one, in the short term, any way you look at it, 2013 will be an extremely disappointing year from an EPS standpoint because of KFC China. We ultimately expect a full recovery, but can\u2019t tell you exactly when. We will post you of our sales progress every month until we get KFC China back on track. At the same time, you need to know, given our confidence, it\u2019s full speed ahead with developments this year in China.I said in New York, when you think of KFC in China, think about McDonald\u2019s in the United States. Everywhere you go in the United States in every county seat in America, you will see a McDonald\u2019s in the very best locations. I\u2019m talking about towns like Chillicothe, Missouri to Hutchinson, Kansas. McDonald\u2019s is literally everywhere and it\u2019s clearly the CSR leader in the United States. They had first in advantage and everyone pales in comparison.In the United States, McDonald\u2019s has 14,000 traditional units in a population of over 310 million. We expect to have at least that many units in China with the consuming class growing from 300 million to 600 million over time and disposable income growing along with it. We will be everywhere that matters in China and have the best locations in every town.Now as I said before, we will inevitably have a challenging year in China and unfortunately 2013 is that year. But every day I wake up, I\u2019m glad we have the business we do. I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 trade places with anyone. Our strategy and capability to build leading brands in China and tap into the number one growth market in the world is simply unparalleled. Number two, in the longer term, we fully expect to return to achieving our annual target of at least 10%. With 2014, the expectation will be a big bounce back year. We believe as strongly as ever Yum! Is uniquely positioned to grow aggressively around the world. Importantly, we continue to strengthen our brands and the processes that ensure success so we become an even stronger company down the road. And number three, this business is a business with endless possibilities. We have growth opportunities staring us in the face in China, emerging markets and now the United States. We will continue with confidence our quest to build the defining global company that feeds the world.So thank you very much and we look forward to answering any and all questions that you have.Timothy JerzykOkay. Mishei, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer-Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions). And your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorganThe sense of what you really could have done differently in this case in terms of the antibiotics that were entering into your chicken supply at all and what prevents that in the future. In other words, are you being asked to do inspection at the farmer level which I can\u2019t imagine? Are you responsible for inspection at the supplier level which quite frankly I thought was the responsibility of different authorities or is it just a process to where you and the government need to communicate more? In other words what really is the process of remediation that prevents this from happening in the foreseeable future?David NovakHey John. I think the beginning of your question got cut off on our end. Can you \u2013 sorry to ask you to redo that, but if you could restate your question that would be helpful to us, the first part.John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorganApologies. The question really centers around what you could have done differently to prevent this. David, you made a comment about learning from history and is it, gosh, if we had more people in the field from an inspection point, if you\u2019re doing inspection at the farmer level which I have a hard time believing that\u2019s your responsibility. Was it your responsibility to do more inspections at the supplier level, which I thought was the responsibility of different authorities? So the question that I have is what is changing specifically within Yum! For an issue like this, whether chicken or related to anything else in your supply chain for not occurring again.David NovakWell, okay John. I think first of all I want to make it really clear that food safety is our top priority and you know we do everything we can to make sure our food is safe and is of the highest quality. We have a global protocol for (inaudible) suppliers on food safety and in quality assurance. And if issues are identified in any case we always take appropriate measures to require our suppliers to immediately rectify the problem. If a supplier does not meet our strict QA standards, we simply will not do business with them. What we are doing is we are continuing to invest in QA around the world and work with suppliers and world renowned outside QA experts to improve our practices.We are doing this all around the world and what we are doing in China is we are going to take our processes to an even higher level and strengthen our QA processes going forward.John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorganAnd I am sure you can appreciate me if you need pressing on this, I mean that was I think everyone\u2019s understanding and belief. And I thought it was a fact that that was already done in China and the fact what you are doing in China was considered to be best in class at Yum!, or best in class quite frankly relative to anyone. So what prevents this from happening in the future? Just doing more of what you have been doing or are you being asked to do some of the job of, quite frankly, what I thought was the responsibility of the authorities?David NovakWhat we are doing is, first of all KFC is the leader in China as you say. We have been the leader in food safety protocols and practices in the past. And that\u2019s a high responsibility and one that we take we seriously as we go forward. Our objective in China is to strengthen our poultry supply chain practices. And this will include improved voluntary self-testing procedures. We do self-testings, we are going to improve that and do it even better. This is above and beyond anything that is required by any laws or regulations. We are going to improve our reporting processes and communications and we are going to enhance our supplier management.What we are working on right with our suppliers is a comprehensive QA program that will be even better than what we think was the world class process. And bottom line is, we will focus on making sure we do everything we can to be the very best in this area. So we will be announcing that shortly after Chinese New Year, the comprehensive QA program and a marketing campaign that will also supplement it.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Jeff Omohundro with Davenport and Company.Jeff Omohundro - Davenport and CompanyMy question relates to the branding efforts to rebuild consumer trust in China. You have mentioned, couple of times you have dealt with similar issues both in China and the U.S. Could you talk a little bit further about the specifics around the efforts, around the spending against these efforts and how broad these efforts might me, including for example, social media and other avenues.David NovakWell, first of all, it starts with the basis that we have a powerful brand that\u2019s extremely popular and people lover our food and they love the experience and we have got a great strength to build on. I think as far as the marketing goes one of the things we have realize is that in any case, regardless of how strong your brand is, it\u2019s going to take time. Because consumers have lots of options that they can go to and I think what we have right now is we literally have to weather the storm of a lot of adverse publicity that is clearly top of mind with customers.So I don\u2019t think there is any marketing we can do today that is going to change what is going on right now because we do need the gift of time. Having said that, we are working very aggressively to develop a superior program with our suppliers on the quality assurance front and we are working on an advertising and marketing approach that will communicate this to the customer. From everything to [trade liners] to ways that we (inaudible) social media, everything which you can basically imagine. One of the things we do have with KFC is we have a big budget. Last year we opened up 900 more restaurants. So we have lots of medias. We have all the capability we need to continue to build the brand the right way, and we will do that.So we will be launching a new program around quality and what we are doing with our suppliers, communicating the press, communicating it over all the social media, and we will launch that shortly after the Chinese new year, but in terms of marketing clout, we go in with more marketing clout just simply by the nature of we do have 900 more stores as we go forward and we have all the marketing clout to make us one of the top advertisers in China and we have every capability to be able to get our message out. But I did think what we need more than anything and Sam Su and I have looked at lots of different options and we\u2019ve talked about this daily is we really need to get the time and I think over time we will come back because this is a powerful brand that\u2019s loved by consumers and we will prevail in the end.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. BairdA question on China. As you think about the actions you need to take to restore confidence in the consumer picture and what is needed to strengthen the business model there, are there any structural changes to the expense structure that need to be made, for example, maybe greater spending on quality assurance or perhaps more focus on value and less margin at the restaurant level? Anything along those lines would be helpful.David NovakWe don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s material at this point to talk about.David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. BairdOkay, great. And then maybe a quick follow-up to the last question. David, you mentioned that on the marketing picture you had plenty of dollars to spend. Just curious to know your thoughts on whether you would actually allocate a higher level of spending temporarily to try to accelerate the recovery.David NovakWe don\u2019t think that there needs to be a material change in our overall market expense to make that happen. Just to put it in perspective, I think we have a marketing budget around $400 million. So that\u2019s a lot of tier rating points you can buy and a lot of things that we can do. So like I said we have all the capability to come back over time.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse.Keith Siegner - Credit SuisseA question for you, maybe a little more color on the mid-teens company restaurant margin target for China for this year, just maybe some details on the big moving pieces, like if we think about pricing to start, should we think of pricing or incremental pricing as off the table for this year? And then in terms of inflation, what\u2019s the update to the commodity outlook? Is chicken cheaper now given that there is so much less demand? Has the labor inflation picture changed? And if there is anything really stand out in terms of things like sales-based rent contracts and that flexing either way, any of the big picture moving pieces on the margins would be really helpful. Thanks.Patrick GrismerAbsolutely, Keith. First of all on the cost side, we\u2019re not seeing any material change to the guidance we provided in New York, specifically with respect to food, labor and rent. The biggest driver of margin pressure is the same store transaction decline and that weighed heavily on us in the fourth quarter and we see that continuing into 2013. What we said as you know is that we expect same store sales to be down 25%, about 25% in the first quarter and that we expect those sales to turn positive in the fourth quarter. I won\u2019t get into the exact slope of the recovery or the extent of the rebound in any given quarter because I don\u2019t think it makes sense here, but what all of that implies is that on a full year basis same-store sales will be down in the mid-single digits. And as you\u2019d expect, the impact to same-store transactions is more significant, probably high singles digit declines and it is the transaction deleverage associated with that sales outcome that is putting the most pressure on margins and it contributes to what we\u2019ve guided under the scenario is a mid-teen margin.Now, you asked specifically about pricing. That is something that we will evaluate throughout the year. Simply based on the actions we took in 2012, there\u2019s a rollover pricing benefit of about 2 points. There could be opportunity depending on what we\u2019re marketing throughout the year to take additional pricing, but we\u2019ve not made any specific assumptions at this time around that. So the primary driver in addition to what we guided in New York around inflation principally for labor but also for food, combined with the transaction deleverage because of the same store sales decline is what will yield what we\u2019ve outlooked is a mid-teen margin for our China business in 2013.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.John Glass - Morgan StanleyCan you just talk about what else is going on in China and specifically, obviously, before this happened there was a 4% decline in sales. There was something else going underneath that and then when you look at the Pizza Hut numbers you are expecting in the first quarter, flat ex the Chinese New year shift. That\u2019s a deceleration. One, is that just the -- do you think there was a brand spillover that\u2019s occurring to that brand or is there no association. If there is no association, what else do you think is going on there at that brand as your macro issue as well.David NovakJohn, we don\u2019t see any spillover effect of the KFC crisis on to Pizza Hut. You recall from our New York investor conference that we talked about the decelerating trend we saw across our business in the back half of last year. And that was implicit in the updated sales guidance that we provided ahead of the investor conference. And we attributed that as you will recall to the fact that we were facing increasingly difficult comparables from the prior year on top of the fact that we were seeing some weakness in our broader retail environment and that was impacting both brands.We saw the decelerating trend across the back half of last year. Now in addition to that you have to bear in mind that as we enter 2013, we are continuing to face significant comparables from prior year. For Pizza Hut alone in the first quarter we recorded 18% same store sales growth in 2012.John Glass - Morgan StanleyOkay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the question about your anticipation of commodity inflation labor etcetera. Why wouldn\u2019t you see greater commodity pressure? I am assuming there is going to be other suppliers that are either going to raise their prices because they have got some higher regulatory burden. They are going to have chicken that is compliant with the regulations and that\u2019s going to be more valuable in the market place. So why wouldn\u2019t you expect to see an uptick in commodity inflation due to this episode.David NovakWe are taking a look at the situation with our team in China and we don\u2019t expect at this stage that there is going to be a material effect.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.Andy Barish - JefferiesMay be shift over to the U.S. business and Taco Bell. Can you give us kind of broad brush stroke again on the, sort of the reallocation and the increases in marketing and obviously the 2Q is a big lap with the DLT rollout from last year. Anything we should be thinking about in terms of quarterly volatility in Taco Bell? Are you planning for that with new products?David NovakWell, again, what we did at Taco Bell, we used to have 2.5% national advertising and 4.5% total advertising. The deal that we struck with the franchisees is we lowered the total cost of 4.25% advertising but then it all goes to international. And when you do the math on that, it increases the media rates considerably because of the greater efficiency of national advertising. So we think that will be a good tailwind throughout 2013.Regarding quarterly stuff at Taco Bell, I would just say that one think to keep in mind is that we had a very strong second quarter last year when we were, one, wrapping the bogus law suit from 2011 but also launching the Doritos, Locos Tacos. So we had a very large Q2 last year of 13%. So that will be sort of the toughest overlap. In the rest of the quarter I don\u2019t see a lot of, necessarily, movement right now. Like I said at the beginning that this would impact Taco Bell but also some of the other brands. We are not seeing a robust economy right now but we think it\u2019s good enough. In the quick service industry we think it\u2019s a good enough economy where if we have the right innovation, the right value, we will be successful.But it is also what I call the rocky recovery. As an example of that, the last week of January, you saw the industry we think was down about 4 points because you were at the end of the pay cycle. Both monthly payers and bi-weekly paychecks, were both coming due at the very end of January. So it\u2019s just sort of the heads-up that you have to play your A game in this business and I believe Taco Bell in particular is playing their A game.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill LynchAgain a couple of questions on China. Looking again at the fourth-quarter negative trend before the chicken supply kicked in, it seems like it was more concentrated at KFC. Do you think there were pricing value differences year-over-year that contributed to that softness, pre the chicken supply issue?David NovakWell, as we said in New York, Joe, we don't believe the pricing really had an impact on the traffic growth. We measure very carefully the impact of pricing as we roll over \u2013 we had a new pricing system we rolled out, increasing the numbers of tiers to 12, if you recall, and rolling through the price increases in a very targeted fashion and somewhat slowly. And this was spent deliberately in order to really assess the impact on the transactions. And over that period of time we did not see a slowdown in the transactions. And at the same time we look at consumer metrics every single month and our consumer metrics in 2012, the metrics on value really hadn\u2019t changed. So we're maintaining a very strong value position. So we don't believe that the pricing's really in play in terms of what we saw in terms of our transaction. So that's how we're looking at it.Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill LynchOkay. And then again kind of a broad question and a couple of slices of this have been asked, but how do you think about the implications of this event, this experience with the chicken supply issue beyond 2013? Will there be changes in the supply chain or government relations or public perception of brand or even Chinese consumer behavior around chicken?David NovakWell, I think as I\u2019ve said before, we are basically \u2013 we're not really looking to have vertical integration. We're concentrating ourselves in the sense of us owning and running chicken farms and chickens supply. We're concentrating on vertical integration at the supplier lever with world class suppliers because frankly given our scale we need multiple sources for chicken. I think what we're doing is we're working 24\/7 right now to develop an even more comprehensive, even more enhanced QA system that will give our customers the products that they are looking for from KFC.Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill LynchOkay. And then just one last one. So YRI fourth quarter comp, I think you guided to plus 4, came in plus 3. Does that variance reflect any spillover of the China into other Asian markets?Patrick GrismerNo. It was closed between 3 and 4 when we guided 4 and we ended up at 3 or just the\u2026OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk Management.Howard Penney - Hedgeye Risk ManagementThe months it took you to recover from the\u2026David NovakI\u2019m sorry, Howard. Can you start over again? We didn\u2019t hear the beginning.Howard Penney - Hedgeye Risk ManagementSorry. That seems to be a pattern here. Do you happen to have the number of months it took for you to recover from SARS, Sudan Red and avian flu in order to benchmark your progress and recovery for this debacle?Richard CarucciHoward, as we look back at how event unfolded in 2005 into 2006, we saw recovery from Sudan Red over a period of six to seven months, but it was at that time then that we were hit with the SARS crisis which extended the recovery out to 12. So there were couple of \u2013 12 months. So there were a couple of events happening at that period of time. And as David has said, there are no two crises that are the same. Each one is very unique and as we\u2019ve come up with a scenario to provide you for how this might play out over the next year, we\u2019ve landed on the scenario of nine to 12 months which is why we\u2019ve suggested as part of this scenario that gets us to a mid-single-digit EPS decline, that we will see same-store store sales turn positive in the fourth quarter.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.Brian Bittner \u2013 OppenheimerThanks very much. I think we all definitely appreciate this enhanced disclosure that you guys are going to be providing on a monthly basis and also definitely appreciate your attempt to, I guess, kind of still get to meet your 2013 EPS guidance. But with this lack of visibility, I mean why you have been kind of communicating the potential positive comps in the fourth quarter because given that\u2019s about a third of the year, that\u2019s going to be so impactful to what you ultimately end up doing this year on the EPS front. And it seems as though with comps still down 25% despite you facing a much easier comparison, a lot of optimism goes into that. So where the confidence really come from to just throw out positive things for sale expectations for the fourth quarter.Patrick GrismerWell, we feel that it\u2019s important to provide some direction versus no direction. We said before that is very difficult, it\u2019s not impossible to predict how this is going to play out. We do look to history to see how our business has performed during other crises. Again, no two crises are the same. But as I mentioned in response to the last question, as we looked at 2005 and into 2006, we felt that it was reasonable to make assumptions that establish a basis for a scenario to give some indication as to how EPS might play out. And that includes an assumption around when same store sales turn positive, and we do take into account as you mention, overlapping from the prior year from one quarter to the next. That is our base case assumption, if you will. We are necessarily characterizing that as a prediction.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA.Diane Geissler - CLSASo I wanted to ask about what the thought process was about the delay between when you receive the final sign-off from the government and when you plan to be back with the media campaign. Just seems like you missed an opportunity to get the message out before the Chinese New Year. And then also, could you comment on what you might have seen in terms of traffic, sort of outside of the you know the Shanghai radius, where I think most of the media attention was focused. Maybe you could talk about other tier one and tier two cities, and then tier three and lower. What did traffic patterns looked like since the start of the year or following the media reports?Richard CarucciYeah, Diane, I'll respond to the second half of your question and David will follow in response to the first part of your question. As you would expect, the impact to our business was much more pronounced in Shanghai itself, which was the focus of the media attention and generally speaking was more pronounced in the higher tier cities than in the lower tier cities.David NovakAnd I think, first, we totally underestimated the impact of this incident. Then we very quickly launched a free beverage and ice cream promotion that had very little impact. And the reality as we concluded is, the consumer needs time and I think the team you should know is working 24\/7 with all kinds of urgency on a comprehensive QA and marketing campaign we'll launch shortly after Chinese New Year. So I think we've done a lot of things. We've been on top of this situation daily and I think basically there is not a whole lot we can do right now that\u2019s going to turn the tide. We need some time. History has also told us we need time and I think we could be wasting a lot of money doing marketing right now. We need to get to time.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason West with Deutsche Bank.Jason West - Deutsche BankSo, on the margin outlook for China just getting to that mid-teens restaurant margins. I\u2019m kind of struggling to get there on a negative comp for the year, and just wondering if there are some cost offsets that we are not aware of? Maybe there is some management of G&A or labor that you guys can control, just in light of the inflation that you guided in December. It's tough to get to kind of a mid-teens margin on these kind of comps?Patrick GrismerAs I mentioned the transaction deleverage is significant and you have seen the effect in our Q4 margin, you may recall that we had expected to see improvement in Q4 margin versus prior year and in Feb we saw a pretty significant decline and it was the transaction to leverage associated with the same-store sales decline in the last two weeks of December that contributed heavily to that result and we expect that that will persist into 2013 as long as we are seeing that same-store transaction decline. Bear in mind that the downside leverage is significant, but at the same time when our sales rebound, the upside leverage is equally significant. But that is the primary driver, along with the inflation that we already communicated with respect to both labor inflation being in the mid-teens and food inflation being in low single-digits.So that explains or it helps provide some additional color around why we feel under this particular set of assumptions or the sale scenario that China restaurant margin will be in the mid-teens. As it relates to overall profitability, the other thing to bear in mind is that we are staying the course as it relates to investment behind growth. And that applies not only to the investment in new unit development, again at least 700 new units in China in 2013 as we guided in the New York, but also investments in G&A to continue to build the capability necessary to unlock those growth opportunities.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Larry Miller with RBC.Larry Miller \u2013 RBCJust two quick questions. I think you guys mentioned the media intensity has subsided. Have you seen same-store sales bottom and begin to recover? And then secondly, is there any way for you to give us a sense of chicken consumption in general in China or is it just your belief that it's more centered on you guys?Patrick GrismerLarry, first of all, with respect to the sales trend, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we are not expecting to see a change in trend from what we saw in December into January. We are assuming for the moment that that continues to the end of February. So, the way I would read that is that while the sales situation hasn't gotten better, it hasn't gotten any worse either. With respect to impact to poultry consumption generally I don't know. What we do know is that KFC has received a lot of attention, has been the target of a lot of negative media attention and that has driven the result that we saw in the last two weeks of December and that has continued into this year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 BarclaysThank you very much. Just specific to China as you think out over the next number of years, obviously the returns have been strong historically and the company operated model allowed you to benefit from the returns and you built the long-term brand and the infrastructure to take advantage of the opportunity, but I think most of us think of you as a global franchisor over time and investors obviously appreciate the YRI model, which you've talked about on a couple occasions of the installation, and I think people would expect the shift over time maybe in China to that type of model. So the question being, with the scares unfortunately more frequent than desired and the volatility that we've seen from that company-operated model, does it give you any reason to consider at least removing some of the company-operated exposure and related deleverage? Or if this type of rationale doesn't do it, would there be any rationale that would lead you to perhaps start to refranchise and jut benefit from that installation?David NovakFrom day one, we've always had a strategy to earn the right to own, and where we want to put company equity is where we have great returns. We continue to have great returns in China in three year cash-on-cash returns. Even in tier one cities it's three to four years now. So across the board we have outstanding returns in China. We have great operating capability and we expect to be predominantly equity in China. Having said that, we are doing some franchising selectively with really good operators, some with people who've worked in our system, store-by-store kind of a model, but we don't see that as a \u2013 we don't see a big shift whatsoever, because we\u2019re just so confident in the long-term returns that we have in China.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.Eric Gonzalez \u2013 UBSHi guys. This is Eric Gonzalez in for David Palmer. Just have a question about maybe how this antibiotic been such a big deal to Chinese customers. What is being said in the Chinese press about KFC and it's chicken supply that is true and untrue? And what can Yum! China specifically say that can help restore the trust in the brand?David NovakWell, I think some -- there\u2019s been some questions about the growth cycle that we have for our chickens or our suppliers have our chicken, which is 45 days. And frankly these things come up from time to time everywhere, but the 45 days is basically our global standard. Frankly, we simply thought this was a non-issue. Then the CCTV story broke and things started to spiral down shortly followed up by the Shanghai FDA investigation. So I think anytime you have any kind of questions anywhere about your food, it creates an issue and a doubt in consumers mind. And bottom line is, there are lots of places to eat. As much as we love KFC, you don't have to go there tomorrow. I mean you can let this thing settle in or take some time to reflect on this and then you go back to the brand and the products that you love, and you want to have as a part of your life.So, I think once again what we are doing about this is, number one, is we know we need some time. And the team is taking this as an opportunity to develop an even more enhanced and even more comprehensive QA program and then we are going to begin communicating to consumers what we've done to make our processes and systems even stronger. And as we do this, we are going to continue to market the brand. We'll have product innovation, like we always do. We'll have marketing commercials. We still have Germany win. We have a lot of things that really make us a cool hit brand in China and we've been locally relevant for years and we are going to stay locally relevant as we go into the future. So, I think what we are going to do is just what I told you.Eric Gonzalez \u2013 UBSAnd just real quick as a follow-up. Have you considered maybe making some fundamental changes to your supply chain, consolidating your suppliers using fewer suppliers?David NovakWell, I think what we are concentrating on, as I mentioned, is vertical integration at the supplier level with world-class suppliers. And we are going to hone in on the real core suppliers, developing that network, making sure that they are world class, investing with them, helping them, sharing whatever we can to ensure that we get the very best products. So, that's how we're handling it.Timothy JerzykMishei, Before we go to next question, I just wanted to clarify one thing for all those on the call. The mid-teens margin that Pat mentioned earlier is company restaurant margin. So just wanted to clarify that. So, Mishei, can we take the next question, please.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.Michael Kelter - Goldman SachsI wanted to ask for a little more of a history lesson about your China experience in 2005, Sudan Red, avian flu issue. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, negative 40% same-store sales I think. How long was that sustained for and what was your plan to improve the brand image at that time and when you did recover to positive double-digits, was it driven by any company specific initiatives like new product news or was it just the benefit of time elapse and just a brand image recovery?Patrick GrismerMichael, just to provide a bit more color around that. The negative 40% was the lowest point that sustained for maybe a couple of weeks and we began to see improvements in the first 30 days or so. And then as I mentioned, as we were finally turning positive from that event about six months later, than we saw the impact of avian flu. In terms of what we did at the time in order to bring back sales, very similar to I know what we have in store now as David mentioned. Which is product news, demonstrating innovation that will bring customers back into their restaurant while also talking about the strength of our brand and rebuilding trust in the quality of our food. So, the plans are generally similar to what we had done seven years ago.David NovakMichael, just (inaudible) is a historian in the room. One of the differences is when Sudan Red occurred, the media attention was very significant, probably maybe even worse than this, but for a shorter period of time. It was in the news for about a week or two. As David said in his remarks, the media attention this time lasted as a lot longer than we expected with the combination of CCTV and the Shanghai FDA and social media, which wasn\u2019t prominent back then. So we're glad that that's beginning to wind down, but that is a difference is in the two events.Michael Kelter - Goldman SachsAnd then I wanted to revisit one more time a question that was already asked, but maybe ask it in a little different way. The updated guidance or estimate of down mid-single-digit seems \u2013 earnings, which is underpinned by the assumption of positive comps in China in the fourth quarter. Since only two weeks of the four months quarter are easy compares from this chicken issue, doesn't that assumption imply that you\u2019re thinking the 25% of consumers that you've lost mostly all come back before the end of the year and doesn't that base case invite the risk that you have to come back to us with another downward revision in the future?","Patrick GrismerWell, as I mentioned to you, what we provided is an assumption to explain some basis for an outlook we are not again characterizing as a prediction because it is impossible to predict in this environment. But as we expect sales to turn positive in the fourth quarter, which we think is a reasonable assumption again based on what we\u2019ve seen in the past, based on the strength of our KFC brand, that's how the numbers come together.","David NovakBut I think Michael, bottom line is we don't know what we don't know. But I think we talked about should we even give any guidance. We felt that we would be better off given you broad assumptions and that's what we've done.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham ResearchI\u2019d like to ask about the new store performance and obviously there is a lot of noise right now, but you did maintain your unit development target for 2013. I guess I would think that the new store sales have been affected somewhat. Can you comment, is it the same degree as the existing stores and maybe bigger picture, could you just give us a sense of how you assess new store performance in this environment to give us a sense that maintaining this level of unit growth is the right move?Richard CarucciWe've always taken a long-term view on our business. So as we expect this situation to be temporary or short-lived, while yes, the impact to sales will affect the near-term returns we are seeing on these investments, we don't see that as a reason to deviate from our long-term growth strategy. We did not see or we have not seen a material difference in the sales impact to new units versus core units, although as I said earlier in response to a question that Diane had raised, we did see a more pronounced impact on units generally in Shanghai, as you'd expect, and broadly more pronounced in higher tier cities versus lower tier cities. But again, fully expecting that the sales will recover, we see this impact to new unit returns in the near-term to not be reason to deviate from our long-term growth strategy for China.Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham ResearchGreat, thanks. And if I could just slip one last question in, just to follow-up on a previous question, it sounds like that we should not expect any step up function in supervision or advertising as a percent of sales on an ongoing basis. Can you maybe explain how that could be? It just seems like that you will have to invest in these types of things to restore confidence, but it doesn't seem like you view it as a step up function. You are just going to reallocate other resources?Patrick GrismerI think the fact is Mitch, we have a $400 million marketing budget. That's a huge amount of effort and we always believe that your money is best spent when you focus it on what consumer perceptions, habits, beliefs you have to change, build, or reinforce the business. So we think every dollar we spend behind reinforcing what we're doing to enhance our quality and it's a dollar well spent that will drive the best possible return for our investors. So we're very comfortable that we have everything we need.David NovakOkay. Thank you guys for your questions. Appreciate it very much. Let me wrap this up. There is absolutely no question we have taken a tough blow, but we have performed well in adverse situations in the past and we are committed to do it again. This is the same business with the same opportunities we talked to you about at our investor conference in New York just two months ago. Any way you look at it, we are still on the ground floor of global growth in China and a whole lot more. So we're very confident about the future and thank you for taking the time. Appreciate it.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22956":["Yum! Brands, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy.

Also on today's call is Larry Gathof, Yum!'s Treasurer who will be participating in Q&A. Following remarks from Greg and Pat, we'll take your questions.","I want to thank all of you who joined us in Texas for our Investor Conference in December. I would like to remind everyone that the presentations from this conference are available on our website.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements.

Investor Events, our first quarter 2016 earnings will be released on Wednesday, April 20th.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased that you could join us today as we share with you the opportunities ahead for Yum! as well as a review of our results.","Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at our Investor Day in December. 2016 will be a transformational year for Yum!, as we complete the spinoff of our China division, ultimately creating two powerful independent focus growth companies. The fundamental goal of Yum! however is unchanged. We are 100% dedicated to building and strengthening KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell all around the world as strong brand critical to delivering the same growth and creating shareholder value over the long-term.","I\u2019m pleased with the positive sales momentum we generated across the majority of Yum! In the fourth quarter. KFC China, for example, grew same-store sales 6% in the last quarter of 2015. This was a sequential improvement from the third quarter and in line with our expectations. Outside of China, each of our brand divisions grew same-store sales on a one and two-year basis. Our U.S. results in the fourth quarter were particularly strong for all three brands, as KFC posted six consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth. Taco Bell continued to outperform the category and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 2%.","On a tuning basis our fourth quarter comps in the U.S. were the best of the year with Pizza Hut at plus 2%, KFC at plus 8%, and Taco Bell at plus 10%. These successes complemented our international results in the quarter where KFC posted 2% same store sales growth with solid results in both emerging and developed markets and Pizza Hut grew same store sales 3% in emerging markets.","Fourth-quarter EPS grew 11%, with full-year EPS growth of 3% in 2015 despite a 7% decline in the first half and 6 percentage points of foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, our brand divisions collectively grew operating profit 8% in constant currency, which is in line with our ongoing growth model targets. This was led by 12% operating profit growth at Taco Bell, a remarkable result given the significant investments we made in the fourth quarter to position the brand for continued momentum and category leadership for the years to come.","Operating profit grew 8% in constant currency in China with impressive cost management partially offsetting weaker than originally expected sales results. We added more than 2,300 new units globally in 2015 and as I look forward out to 2016 to be a year of improved performance building on the fourth quarter's momentum. This year we expect to open nearly 2,400 new restaurants, which means we\u2019re opening over six restaurants a day, laying the groundwork for future growth. With all of this in mind, we are reiterating the guidance we initially gave you in December. Given the results we have seen year-to-date and the plans we have laid out for each of the brands, we're confident in our ability to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency in 2016.","Now I'd like to discuss what gives me confidence in the future for each of our businesses. After that Pat will walk you through the financials. So first China, as I mentioned, KFC which represents about 75% of the division's operating profit grew same store sales 6% in the fourth quarter continuing the sequential improvement we saw throughout the year. System sales grew 9% in the quarter as we added 114 net new units, so crossing the 5,000 unit mark. I'm thrilled the China team is applying global best practices, fresh thinking and new insights to revitalize the brand and achieve attraction with consumers.","Early test results of proven global sales volume package are encouraging and the implementation of this program should drive transactions and benefit the division later this year. One example is box meals which has proven successful globally and we expect to be similarly well received in China. I can assure you we are taking the right steps to grow the business and the momentum we are seeing makes me confident, we will.","Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China which represents -- has represented about 25% of China's operating profit, has proven more challenging. System sales in constant-currency grew 4% in the fourth quarter, as we added 151 net new units, but same-store sales declined 8%. The macroeconomic environment and volatile stock market has impacted the Casual Dining segment and we know we have to generate more exciting news and value to counter this headwind. We'll be more focused on value going forward with work day lunch specials and value pieces as well as other initiatives to drive traffic. We have our work cut out for us here and we'll be moderating our redundant pace a bit this year. Nevertheless the China team has a number of strategies and concepts in test that we expect to improve results. We now have substantial run rate for new units and same store sales growth for China's leading western Casual Dining brands.","Before I move on to the other divisions I want to give you a quick update on January sales in China. We are encouraged by what we are seeing at KFC, but Pizza Hut sales remain soft. It's difficult to gauge exactly where the first quarter will finish, especially given the earlier timing of Chinese New Year. But at this point we expect same-store sales growth to be up low-single digits for the division which sets us up well for the balance of the year. We expect solid KFC sales going forward and even with the potential of negative results at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in the first half we are reconfirming our full year guidance for the China division to generate same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%, operated profit growth of 10% in constant-currency and to open 600 new restaurants.","Now turning to our three brand divisions, KFC is a franchise led emerging power house. Franchisees opened 85% of our 705 new international restaurants in 2015. Total system sales grew 11% in emerging markets for the year with particular strength in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. In fact Russia has generated system sales growth of at least 40% in each of the last four years. I'm also encouraged by our recent performance in developed markets such as Australia, Japan and the United States. These results reinforce my confidence in the brand's ability to drive sales going forward. We don't only have an ability to generate meaningful growth in mature markets where we have a long established presence; we also have tremendous potential in emerging markets where we have a significant lead over the competition. So, we are taking our global brand identity and unifying that with local cultural insights to expand and grow our business pull around the world. We are 100% focused on our real, authentic and freshly prepared food and merging that with value and innovation to drive results.","On the international front, we've enjoyed success with lunch and dinner box meals and we're delighted by the ideas created in the United States are finding their way into the system. For example we just introduced Nashville Hot in the U.S., this is a spicy version of our crispy chicken inspired by one of Nashville's most famous dishes. The New Year pipeline at KFC remains impressive. In KFC's top 12 emerging markets, excluding China, we only have one restaurant for a 1 million people. Today with an aggregate population of 3 billion people in these markets, think of the potential. Across the world we have plans in place to grow sales and to build on the division's consistent operating growth performance. I'm confident KFC will continue to excel and reward shareholders for years to come.","At Pizza Hut U.S. we are starting to turn the corner with our focused emphasis on making it easier to get a better pizza. This runs the gamut from improved operations and insight driven food innovation to digital enhancements and consistent value. While we recognize there's a lot more work to do, we are now generating consistent public transactions and same-store sales growth in the United States. Equally significant and as you heard in December, we reached an important agreement with our U.S. franchisees. Starting in January we began overhaul of our assets replacing ovens and upgrading in-store technology. From a marketing calendar perspective we are focused on a balanced approach. This begins with premium product innovation such as our recent launch of Stuffed Garlic Knots Pizza to protect and improve unit level economics. You may also have seen the launch of our $5 Flavor Menu, the most compelling value menu in the pizza business.","In conjunction with our ongoing $6.99 any pairs deal, it will provide our customers with great value on an ongoing basis. We are encouraged by the solid year at Pizza Hut in United States and we believe we have the right strategy going forward. Our international business at Pizza Hut is led by strength in emerging markets but offset by weakness in some of our developed markets. We believe we can apply best practices from the U.S. business to drive growth in these developed markets going forward.","Finally Taco Bell delivered a fantastic 2015 surpassing $9 billion in system sales and we expect a solid year in 2016 as well. Taco Bell is on the cutting edge of QSR and it again received gold standard for social engagement, product development, brand positioning and advertising. We have several new exciting products launching this year including one we'll announce during the Super Bowl. So, be sure to watch the first half to see the national introduction. Our innovation focus extends beyond just food. We are encouraged by early results of our delivery program and our developing expansion plans for additional cities. The addition of our loyalty program in November built on our mobile app and will increase brand affinity as it rewards social behavior.","So furthermore we are focused on our core value messaging to drive transactions. We continue to build on our breakfast daypart where sales are growing at twice the rate of our business as a whole, in fact we grew breakfast transactions 6% in the fourth quarter. Given the brand's strong economics and broad franchise appeal, we continue to accelerate New Year openings both domestically and internationally, with a record number of U.S. openings in 2015 and we expect to build upon this in 2016.","I am particularly excited that we're starting to some traction, expanding the brands internationally. We know this process will take time but we're making real progress here. Our growth spends both domestically and internationally will lay the ground work for higher operating profit growth in the years to come. With all this progress you can see why I am very excited about what's happening in our company. We are underlying the biggest strategic move in the history of Yum! with our spin-off of the China business. We are confident this will create two large optimally structured independent companies with unique investment profiles.","Yum! China will target 50% ongoing EPS growth as it focuses solely on Mainland China and will pay the new Yum! a 3% license fee. New Yum! will become a high margin global franchise company targeting 15% shareholder return. Recapitalization plans are underway and will be completed in the first half of this year. We see substantial value in our shares at common prices as we have repurchased 23 million shares from the announcement of the separation through last night.","I want to assure you that while the spin-off transaction is critically important, we're not going to let it distract us from running the business in China or anywhere else. All three of our brands have significant opportunities for growth as they progress along the journey to brand excellence. We expect to achieve 10% constant currency growth and operating profit this year as a company and are setting up two separate companies that will lead the restaurant industry going forward. Yum! is in a unique position. We have three iconic brands and are making them even stronger. As you've heard me say before, my goal as CEO is to build three global iconic brands that people trust and champion.","We are well on our way to achieving this, led by our brand positioning, courageous leadership and committed team members and franchisees. Needless to say there is lot to be excited about Yum! and I could not be more pleased to lead this company into its next stage.","And finally as you all know this is Pat's last earnings call with Yum! and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank him for his leadership, his hard work and an unwavering drive to raise the bar of Yum!. He will be missed across the organization. As you may have seen in our 8-K filings we have appointed our current Corporate Controller, Dave Russell, as interim CFO and I look forward to working with him, while we complete our search for a permanent CFO.","And with that, it gives me great pleasure to hand the call over to Pat.","Pat Grismer","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I'll cover three areas; our fourth quarter results, our outlook for 2016, and an update on the separation of our China business. I too am pleased with the overall sales momentum that we demonstrated in the fourth quarter where EPS excluding special items grew 11%. Reported EPS growth was considerably higher as last year's fourth quarter included a non-cash special item charge related to the impairment of our Little Sheep concept in China. Excluding special items and the impact of foreign exchange, operating profit grew a healthy 17% in the fourth quarter led by system sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin improvement of over 3 percentage points.","I'll now take you through our results by division, starting with our China business. For the division overall, same store sales grew 2% in the fourth quarter. As we pre-announced, KFC grew same store sales 6%, which was sequentially better than Q3 as we expected. We're encouraged by the positive momentum in our KFC China business particularly as it is sustained into the New Year. Same store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining however have remain sluggish and declined 8% in the fourth quarter. As Greg said, the China team is addressing this matter with urgency and we will update you on our progress through the year.","Restaurant margin management continues to be a bright sport in China's performance. For the fourth quarter, China restaurant margins more than 4 percentage points versus prior year to 11.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC and productivity improvements across the division more than offsetting sales to leverage at Pizza Hut. As a reminder, our fourth quarter is a seasonally low sales period for the China division, so the absolute restaurant margin tends to be lower at that time of year. Full year restaurant margin was 15.9% for the division an improvement of 1 full percentage point. It's not often that you see restaurant margins expand with declined sales, so this highlights the extent of the China team's efforts to improve profitability through cost controls.","I am proud of the team's continued focus on productivity and confident this bodes well for further profit growth in China as same store sales continue to recover and unlock significant profit leverage in the business. Given our continued strong belief in China's long-term growth potential and encouraged by continued strong cash paybacks on new units, we opened 743 new restaurants in 2015. And while we're prudently dialing back the pace of the new unit development in 2016, targeting about 600 new restaurant openings, we also expect fewer closures this year. So our net new units will be similar to 2015.","Our decision to temper the pace of development balances the reality of current market conditions with the opportunities we have to enter new trade zones and expand our presence in existing ones. We are also making good progress on modernizing our estate. In 2015, we remodeled about 500 restaurants in China, and we plan to remodel about another 550 in 2016. By the end of this year, we will have remodeled or newly built about 45% or nearly half of our China's estate in a three year period.","Now moving to our global KFC division, which posted its eighth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets up 10% led by Russia and Southeast Asia. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth up 6% led by Australia, Japan and Western Europe. And the U.S. recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth at 3%. Restaurant margins grew 90 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter and improved to 150 basis points for the year to nearly 15%.","Operating profit grew 7% in the quarter before the impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting this for the lap of a one-time favorable pension resolution as well as incremental advertising expense associated with our U.S. acceleration agreement, operating profit grew 11% in the quarter roughly in line with KFC's ongoing growth model. Importantly, KFC set another new record for international development in 2015 opening 705 new restaurants, demonstrating the power of this global iconic brand.","Our global Pizza Hut division delivered 1% same store sales growth for the quarter led by 2% same store sales growth in our U.S. business, which accounts for about half of division system sales. Operating profit improved 6% in constant currency driven by higher franchise fees and higher restaurant margins, partially offset by an increase in U.S. G&A including severance and other one-time costs. Restaurant margins actually improved 240 basis points in constant currency for the quarter driven by same store sales leverage and commodity depletion. For the year Pizza Hut opened 429 new international units. While this was below our initial forecast for 2015, we now have a more robust development pipeline and are confident that we'll open at least 525 new international units in 2016.","Finally, Taco Bell posted 4% same store sales growth in the quarter. Restaurant margin improved 3.1 percentage points to 23.7% raising full year margins to approximately 22%, a remarkable achievement for this power house brand. Operating profit however declined 7% in the fourth quarter due to an expected increase in G&A related to performance based incentive compensation, strategic growth investments including restaurant technology and international supply chain and other non-recurring costs. We believe these investments will strengthen the brand and help to sustain positive momentum in the business. As evidence of the one-time nature of these expenses, we actually expect Taco Bell's G&A will decline in 2016. Additionally, we expect restaurant margins to remain above 20%, even with our more aggressive push on value.","On the development front, we opened 276 new stores in 2015. This included 41 units outside the U.S., four times the number we opened in 2014, demonstrating the progress we're making to ramp up international development. 87% of the division's new restaurants were opened by franchisees reflecting the attractive investment return the Taco Bell brand generates.","I'd now like to talk about our 2016 outlook. Supported by the results we've seen year-to-date, we continue to expect to deliver operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency this year. And while I won't be providing quarterly guidance, I'd like to point out that certain brands are facing hurdles, both prior year laps and timing of current year expenses which will weigh on first half results. As a consequence we expect second half operating profit growth will be directionally stronger in the first half. This is consistent with our plans coming into the year and we remain confident we will achieve our full year operating profit guidance.","Now I'd like to quickly cover our spin-off plans. We're making good progress and are on track to complete the separation of our China business by the end of this year. A major part of our plan is to optimize the capital structure of Yum! Brands and return $6.2 billion to shareholders prior to the separation to the issuance of new debt. From the time we announced the separation through last night, we've repurchased 23 million shares. While our weighted average basic share count for the quarter was 433 million, our basic share count as of February 2, 2016 was 411 million. We see value in repurchasing our shares in what we consider to be a discounted price and view this as a prudent use of shareholder capital.","I'm also happy to report that we're on schedule to complete our recapitalization in the first half of the year, issuing incremental debt of approximately $5.2 billion and plan to maintain roughly 5 times EBITDA leverage going forward. We're now in the process of finalizing the form and timing of this financing. Now I'm sure you've noticed the volatility in the high-yield debt market particularly within the energy and materials sectors. We'll continue to watch this closely, but we're pleased that the rates on our future debt remains very attractive on a historic basis and we're coasting ahead with our plans.","So, let me wrap things up, 2016 will be an exciting year for Yum! Brands. Not only do we expect to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency, but we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China division into an independent publicly traded company. Yum! China will have no external debt and will self fund growth capital, while generating significant free cash flow in year one and on an ongoing basis. The New Yum! will be a global diversified franchise company with an optimal capital structure. By 2017 we will be 96% franchised with a stable but fast growing free cash flow strength.","I'm pleased I was able to participate in this landmark decision for the company and that we are optimizing shareholder value by creating two powerful investment opportunities. I'm very confident in both companies future growth prospects and look forward to their ongoing success.","And with that I'll open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass","Pat first could I just follow-up on the question, comments you made about certain brands are facing certain hurdles in the first half. Well are these sales hurdles, profit hurdles, which brands, can you just directionally point us in the right direction so we can model in appropriately?","Pat Grismer","It is a combination of both sales and spending. Clearly in the case of Pizza Hut in China our expectations for the first half are more muted and we expect their sales recovery to improve in the back half of the year. So, that'll be around the first half results. At the same time we have spending in some of our global brand divisions that will be more heavily concentrated in the first half of the year and then in the second half of the year we'll be lapping some of the investments that were made in G&A and so that will contribute to the shape of earnings over the course of the year.","John Glass","How much did Pizza Hut China impact the margins this quarter, in other words, is there real bifurcation occurring? I assume there is but maybe you can quantify how much the weight that Pizza Hut is placing on the margin for China? And also can you just talk about why not -- is this the moment you start developing Pizza Hut delivery more aggressively, since that seems like there's a huge untapped opportunity at the same there's some issues obviously with the dine-in business?","Pat Grismer","Yes, first with respect to margins in China, I'm not going to bifurcate by brands but it is fair to say and as you've seen from the comps that we've reported that the sales performance at Pizza Hut Casual Dining was not as strong as for KFC in China. And that's largely due to more significant transaction declines in that business and so did weigh more heavily on Pizza Hut China margins in particular. And then with respect to development you're absolutely right, it's early days for the Pizza delivery business in China and so we will be picking up pace development for that particular concept as we look to temper the pace of development of both KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining in 2016.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer","Just a question on the role of value at Pizza Hut China, could you just give us perhaps a little bit of a retrospective and looking forward about what value you need for that brand? Did Pizza Hut China really get away from the five star dining at three star prices in recent years, making it more vulnerable now? And can you share what you brought out so far and the sort of value you might be thinking about for the brand and do you think that's going to enough to offset the casual dining weakness in the country? Thanks.","Greg Creed","Sure, David. Well I think first of all, obviously the macros which have got worse since December, since we were all together in December and I think we all know that macros impact casual dining more than they impact QSR. So, I think there's definitely that issue. I would agree with you that we've not had enough value in use to overcome this backdrop. I think we've also as we've spoken out in previous calls, there is a lot of discussion around steak and fajitas and there wasn't as much discussion if you just think about around pizzas. And so I think our ability to talk value but to talk value around pizzas, I think you'll see more of that going forward. So, yes, the answer is we got to focus on the core to strengthen our brand positioning. We have got to target value to increase transactions such as smart value across daypart. We also have to I think improve our in-store experience in order to stay ahead with the competition. And I think the other thing we have got to be a leader in digital we got to say relevant. And I think there's a lot of things that we can do in that market as well. To I guess round out the answer, we've got about five value programs in test for Pizza Hut in China. We're going to see some early encouraging results but that's going to take us some time to get into the marketplace and as Pat I said I think you'll see a much better second half than you'll see first half out of Pizza Hut China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from UBS. Your line is open.","Keith Siegner","Two quick questions, sorry folks, the first one being when we look at the success of the three global brands particularly here in the U.S. in recent quarter on both sales and margins perspective, how should we think about that margin trajectory into this year? We've got easing costs, we've got very intense competition, how do we think about the margins for those three segments this year? And then to follow that up, can you give us an update on the plans to refranchise those three brands, the plan to go from 91% to 95% by the end of '17, how is that progressing? And maybe to be some extent how does the success of those brands recently impact that refranchising effort? Thanks.","Pat Grismer","Certainly, Keith. First in terms of margin performance in the three global brands, bear in mind our equity ownership in those three global brand businesses I think collectively is in the order of 10%, so it's a franchise driven business. But nonetheless we do focus on restaurant margins both for the benefit of our company as stated and importantly to ensure that our franchisees are realizing good returns on their investments. I would say overall we're pleased with the progress we're making on margins for our KFC global division to improve about 1 percentage point versus last year was quite a significant accomplishment, a combination of same store sales growth and productivity improvements contributing to that. At Pizza Hut equally happy with the progress we've made this year to your point supported by the commodity inflation as well as in the last quarter some sales growth. And then for Taco Bell another banner year with restaurant margins on a full year basis, we are on 22%. As we build on that momentum into next year, we are expecting our KFC and our Pizza Hut businesses to continue to realize margin improvement aided by same store sales leverage as well as more modest commodity outlook than we've seen in some years before. In the case of Taco Bell, my expectation is that margins will be up above 20% perhaps a bit below where they were in this year because of the more aggressive push on value and a more temperate approach to pricing. And then in terms of the refranchising, the teams are very much committed to realizing the objectives that we laid out to achieve 96% franchise ownership by the end of 2017. In the last 30 days Greg and I have met with each one of the global brand divisions to review their refranchising plans and their very discreet plans around specific geographies and pacing associated with that. Given the complexity of some these transactions, we would expect the refranchising activity will be more heavily concentrated in 2017.","Greg Creed","Can I just add a point on the brands, just want to build on the point, Keith you asked. What I am really excited about, and I guess this is in Southeast Asia in January is that the positioning for the three global brands is really starting to be -- I am starting to see it on a global basis. So there is always original KFC whether it's this whole idea that we need to make it easier to get better at Pizza Hut and obviously a holding month at Taco Bell. I happened to be in Thailand, about less than two months after we sort of rolled out, need to make to easier to get better at Pizza Hut, I am in Bangkok and I am seeing really focused plans about what we have to do to get better and what we do to make it easy. So I think the thing I am really encouraged about is now that we have got this positioning clear for the three brands. It's the pace at which I am seeing that appear in the markets in 126 countries that we authorize that's giving me encouragement that we can continue to drive same store sales growth going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane Geissler","I just have a question on the new unit development and maybe just more a clarification. So when we think about the units that you're opening in China this year, can you give us a breakdown between KFC and Pizza Hut and then as the Pizza Hut slowdown just in your model is it temporary or is it more a shift from actual buying into delivery units?","Pat Grismer","Certainly, Diane. When we look at the 740 or so that we opened this year, about 350 were KFC, 280 at Pizza Casual Dining and the balance split between the Pizza Home Service and Little Sheep. When we look out to 2016 and our expectation of around 600 new unit openings, that\u2019s about 20% reduction. That about 20% reduction applies almost equally to KFC and the Pizza Hut. So we're looking at deceleration in the pace of development for both KFC and for Pizza Hut Casual Dining. And we don't expect that, that is an indication of how things are going to play out much longer term. It's just that as I mentioned in my prepared remarks earlier, given current market conditions, we feel that it's prudent to dial back in that but we continue to be very confident in the value we will create from these investments as we're continuing to see cash payback to around three years and we know the long-term growth potential of the market remains significant. So we do expect that at some point in time the pace of development will increase for all brands.","Greg Creed","I think the discussions that I have been having with Micky are really around, we still see 20,000 plus restaurants on the horizon as an opportunity. I think that we still believe in the growth story of China, the consuming class, the EPS, the economics not what they used to be but it's still better than most other places in the world. And I think as we get these brands fully positioned and we get back to doing the things that we've spoken about that we need to do. I think long-term we remain still committed that this is at least in what I'll call my horizon 20,000 restaurant unit opportunity for the China business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Karen Holthouse","Hi, thank you for the question. You guys, I was surprised to see a tick down into your conference in emerging markets, at KFC and a little bit more material at Pizza Hut, particularly in light of commentary about strength in Russia, strength in Eastern Europe. I am curious if there is any particular regions of the world you would point to that are causing a little bit of softness there and what might be causing that?","Pat Grismer","Karen, what I'd highlight for both KFC and for Pizza Hut in terms of the emerging markets which remain strong overall given what we're seeing by way of system sales growth is that the same store sales growth has probably been a bit below our expectations for some of the emerging markets in South East Asia.","Karen Holthouse","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Thank you very much. Actually just two restaurant margin questions. One in China, Pat, I think you said for this full year it was 59 plus 100 basis points and that was quite impressive considering the sales decline. As we think about 2016 and you talk about 2% to 3% comp growth, I'm wondering, why perhaps the guidance? I think you've mentioned in the past maybe 15% plus margin in '16. Wondering why it wouldn't be significantly higher if presumably due to those positive comps? And maybe you can offer some food and labor commentary. And a similar question on Taco Bell, I mean Keith said right, greater than 20% margin in '16 but down from '15 it sounds like there is a big value push perhaps coming. So I'm wondering, if you guys can just talk a little about the category, with a little bit discounting going on seems to have intensified of late and where Taco Bell is well positioned to respond to that. Thanks.","Pat Grismer","Certainly, and we'll start with China. We finished the year from a margin perspective in China stronger than we'd expected. And so our current expectation is that margins in 2016 will be about in line with 2015, so around 16%. As you mentioned we're expecting to realize some benefit from same store sales growth but we're taking I'd say a more tempered approach to pricing, given the focus on value as the team's emphasis is on building transactions, building healthy transactions. And so that may mean that we wouldn't take pricing that we might have in the past to fully offset inflation and we'll be much happier with an outcome where we'd build transactions with that margin, as opposed to growing margins. And so that's the outlook for China. As it relates to Taco Bell, I'd say things are a little bit similar in the sense that the emphasis will be on value to build on a great momentum we had in 2015. We are expecting modest inflation I'd say probably more than we've realized historically in the labor category for our company stores. We're anticipating there could be some movement in wage rates and I'd say modest outlook on commodity inflation for the Taco Bell business.","Greg Creed","Just let me talk to about whole question about value, I think the great thing is that Taco Bell is incredibly well positioned, it remains the value leader. But look, we've all seen what's been happening in the marketplace in the early year: five for $4, four for $4, two for $2, so let's not kid ourselves. So, there's been a fair amount of value initially out there. So as you would expect from a well positioned brand, they are back looking at the calendar, I think you'll see some changes that will come out. Obviously they have got this great new product launch coming out on Sunday, so I think that will have a positive impact on the brand. They will do the right thing and I'll make sure that they continue to be well positioned in the value leader in the marketplace going forward that's what you should expect great brands to do.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Bittner","Thanks, guys. I've two questions, first is on China, kind of following up. In the fourth quarter you did have great margin leverage again and operating profit growth of almost 200% on a 2% comp and you're expecting similar comps going forward as you had in the fourth quarter. So can you just talk again a little bit more about what investments are being made in China that are going to keep the margin and profit growth more in check as your guidance kind of suggests? And then I do have a follow up.","Pat Grismer","Well, first in terms of China margin for 2016, as I mentioned there will be much stronger emphasis on value in order to simulate traffic and as a consequence we're not necessarily expecting that pricing will fully offset inflation. What we're expecting by way of inflation in 2016 is about 1% for food and high single-digits for labor, but again we're not expecting to fully offset that to pricing, as maybe has been our past practice, as the team is refocusing on building transactions. We're counting on continued productivity improvements probably not the heroic improvements that we've seen in years past. If we do better than 2% to 3% comps in 2016, we would expect margins to improve but we're not planning for that right now. The other variable though is labor efficiency, because the team let's face it has consistently surprised us to the upside and that could provide further tailwind to China margins in 2016. We think at this stage guiding about flat margins year-over-year, is appropriate.","Brian Bittner","That make sense. And then the second question just on the pending recap that you expect to be completed here in the first half. You said at the Investor Day that you are targeting 5.25% blended interest rate, is that still an achievable targeted rate as you stand here today?","Larry Gathof","Yes, Brian. It's Larry Gathof. As Pat mentioned, the markets have been very volatile and spreads definitely have widened across the market. That said, there's a lot of bifurcation in the market. The good credits are still getting done at fairly good and attractive rates, especially on historic basis. So it really depends on exactly what we execute and we're evaluating and doing some specifics around both the tenure of the debt and the types of the debt we've put out there. So the 5.25% I would say was still in the game, but it's probably 5.25% or plus, not on the lower end of that at this point.","Pat Grismer","And Brian, that 5.25% that we referenced was for the entire debt portfolio of Yum!, not just the incremental debt. So just wanted to make that clear. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","A question on China margins. Obviously you guys were happy with margins, given the comps in 2015. You were happy with the levels in the fourth quarter as well. But the question that has to continue to be asked and certainly we've been asking it for the last couple of years; to what extent that attention to cost controls, labor efficiency, other OpEx efficiency, what have you, has actually in some way contributed to the lack of traffic recovery that you guys have consistently expected? So I just want to see whatever research or information, anything qualitative, quantitative that you may have to make everyone comfortable that you haven't gone too far. And in that context, is some of the guidance on China margins in 2016 an admission that there are no more structural cost cuts or tactical cost cuts that exist within the China system and that margins are really now going to be a function of comps?","Greg Creed","Let me just start with that one. I will take that. I think the -- certainly the customer metrics -- certainly on KFC, the customer metrics are now back pre the incident, so I think it doesn't matter what metrics you look at. I would say all of those metrics are obviously way back. In an absolute sense, the Pizza Hut metrics are actually higher than the KFC metrics. Probably haven't regained as much momentum, but they are in an absolute sense higher. I think the other thing, just to address your question, is there's a lot of work being done on menu simplification as well. And so I think what we've got to do is, obviously besides looking at labor and other costs that go into it, is how do we simplify the menu so that we make it easier for the customer to speed up the experience? In KFC's case or in Pizza Hut's case, I think, you know, really deliver the best casual dining in-store experience in order to stay ahead. So there's a number of initiatives around simplified menu boards, box meals make it actually easier for the customer to order rather than standing in queue and lining up. So we're spending a lot of time making sure that the margin improvements do not impact the customer experience. And all of the evidence that I can see suggests that there is no impact on the customer experience. And Micky has the bit between the teeth on improving the speed of service, particularly in KFC. And there's a number of initiatives in place that I think will actually enhance that experience, enhance throughput, and obviously lead to sales and transaction growth.","Pat Grismer","And John, what I would add to what Greg has said is that we continue to believe that long term, 20% is an appropriate margin target for the China business. And you have to think about that in the context of where average unit volumes are today and where we know they can go. We're not putting a time frame on it, but we know that there is enormous profit leverage in the business, given all the productivity gains that have been made in the last two to three years. And that as the same-store sales continue to recover, we will see significant margin improvement. To your point, that is from comps, but I also wouldn't underestimate the opportunity for the China team to continue to realize some structural improvements in the business. They've consistently delivered well beyond our expectations. They have enormous capability, and I think that the next leg of productivity improvement in the restaurants will be unlocked by technology. And it's fair to say that the digital capabilities of our China business are the best that we have in our entire company. We are all very excited about how that's going to transform the customer experience and that will unlock further productivity opportunity in our restaurants and contribute to that improving margin over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","David Tarantino","My question is on the Pizza Hut business in China. And I know this might be hard question to answer, but I was wondering, if there is any way you can dissect how much of the comps weakness you've seen recently is more related to macro issues versus internal issues? And I guess said differently, is there any benchmarks within that market that you're looking at that would say you are underperforming or over performing relative to the industry there? And then I have a follow-up.","Greg Creed","Okay, David, let me take one. We don't have obviously the sort of information we have in the U.S. We don't have credit and MPD data to try and get to the specifics that you're asking. I think we all know -- and we've seen this not just in China, but outside that casual dining is impacted by macros. It's just what happens. And it always has a bigger impact on casual dining when macros are volatile and changing than it does on the QSR business. So if I were to say what are the four factors, I would say macros. I think the second one would be not having enough value news in order to overcome this sort of macro backdrop, which is why we've got a number of macro tests in the marketplace right now. And obviously with a sense of urgency, we need to get these tests into the marketplace. I think there is definitely competition. There's definitely more competition in the marketplace. I don't think a lot of this competition is going to try and scale up on the broad scale like Pizza Hut is. And then I think that the last thing or the last point or factor I think would be aggregators, but that's a small percentage of total sales. So I would say it's macro, it's value, it's competition, and it's aggregators. That would be -- I can't put a percentage on for you. I know you would like it, but those would be the four factors. And that's why our response has to be focus on the core to strengthen the brand positioning, target value increased transactions, deliver the best in-store dining experience. And then leading digital, as Pat said, whether it's free Wi-Fi, queue ticketing, pre-ordering, and then partnerships with people like Alipay and WeChat to drive cashless payment as well as the loyalty program. So that's the things we're doing in response to the four things we see driving the performance we're not happy with in Pizza Hut China.","David Tarantino","Great. And I guess the follow-up to that -- that's very helpful. But the follow-up is if it ends up being mostly macro, it seems like you are swimming into a pretty stiff current on some of this. How much contingency have you built into the plans, if the Pizza Hut business doesn't stabilize as you expect in the second half?","Greg Creed","Well, I think there's two things. First of all, we do have a number of tests, so I don't want anyone to go away thinking that we haven't developed a number of test scenarios. Now, I think the difference between KFC and Pizza Hut is, in KFC we can draw on proven ideas from the other 100 countries we've got KFC. There's less opportunity to do that, but I can assure you that Micky and the team are really focused on what I would call these value platforms being tested and obviously what we're trying to resolve the impacts. We need to see positive sales impacts and I think some of the early day test results suggest we're seeing sales impacts in these tests somewhere between plus 1% to plus 7%. So we've still got a long way to go. We've got to get them into the real world, but I am at least optimistic with what I'm seeing in the tests. But this is a hard slog. This is definitely a lot harder than KFC in China. We're going to have to work really hard, but we've got the right team in order to come up with the right ideas to overcome all the values that even macros or competitors put in our way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Karen Short","So a couple questions on Pizza Hut. I guess your U.S. comp seemed to come in at the low end of expectations, at least as you stated at your December Analyst Day and international is a little uninspiring. So first question is any color as to why? And then I guess two related questions would be, you outlined the path to achieving a 3% comp at Pizza Hut at the Analyst Day with various initiatives, but it seems a little optimistic on a blended basis. And then the last portion of the question is there any way to accelerate the common POS conversion? Because it seems like one common system might really be the backbone that you would need before comps can really re-accelerate. Thanks.","Greg Creed","Let me start with the U.S. comps. I mean, they were plus 2%; it was our best quarter in three years. And I agree, it doesn't -- it sort of pales with the KFC two-year conservate and talk about a 10%, but it was our best quarter in three years. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, I'm very encouraged by the start for 2016 for Pizza Hut. And what I'm encouraged about is how rapidly this whole idea of we need to make it easier to get better is going around the world. I know that in the past if I had turned up in Bangkok two months after we came up with an insight of easy beats better, I probably would not have seen that being impacted or reflected in the work either to make us better or make this easier. So I'm encouraged by the start for Pizza Hut in 2016. I have confidence that you will see us deliver sequential improvement in same-store sales this quarter versus the fourth quarter. And every journey has to start somewhere and I think that journey started in the fourth quarter of 2015. And then I am encouraged by how rapidly we are taking this idea and seeing it now being impacted and addressed by all of our teams around the world.","Pat Grismer","And then, Karen, as to your question regarding the common POS, the team estimates it will take a couple of years to migrate all of the restaurants in the U.S. to a common platform. So they are targeting end of 2017 to accomplish that. It is a high priority, but given the extent of integration between those different POS systems and back-of-house and other applications, it will take some time in order to do it properly and minimize disruption to our business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jason West","Just two separate questions. One, can you breakout in the China comp for the quarter kind of where you are on pricing and then I guess if mix was meaningful there as well? And then separately, Pat, now that we are a little closer to the leverage event, do you have any updates on how you're thinking about use of proceeds? Would you lean more on an accelerated share repurchase or are you also considering a special dividend or more of a gradual buyback? Thanks.","Pat Grismer","Certainly. In terms of the China comp for the fourth quarter, the 2% increase reflected a 4% benefit from pricing and then we also had a positive benefit or impact of mix -- sales mix, and then that was offset by some transaction decline in getting to the 2% comp. With respect to our leverage event and use of proceeds, as you know, a lot of it comes down to valuation and where things are at, at the time. So it's early to say exactly how we're going to be returning the cash.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles","Pat, just a quick housekeeping, if you can give us the puts and takes on China margins this quarter. And then separately, as China food costs continue to be quite favorable, I know there's a little bit of inflation for next year as well as some more resilient pricing. Should we expect you to sacrifice this favorability for traffic in order to more aggressively pursue value in 2016, both China brands, relative to the promotions you ran in 4Q?","Pat Grismer","Okay, Andrew. First in terms of the drivers of Q4 margin, we were very pleased with the performance in the quarter. Margins were up versus prior year about 4.5 percentage points, and here's how it breaks down. When you take the 4% pricing, add to it the mix benefit, and strip off the impact of the transaction decline, that's about a net 2 point benefit. On top of that, we had a 3 point benefit from productivity, and another 1 point benefit from closed stores. Offsetting that was a 1.5 margin attributable to inflation. Commodities were flat, but we had 6% inflation on labor. And so that's basically the lock to the 4.5 point gain in margin versus prior year. In terms of how we are thinking about 2016, as I mentioned before, the team is very much focused on building transactions. So while we do expect some modest inflation from a commodity perspective, up about 1% and high single digits for labor, we're not planning to take pricing to entirely offset that. We will look to some ongoing productivity improvements to help mitigate the impact of inflation. But the goal is to at least maintain margin year-over-year at around 16% and to achieve meaningful improvement in transactions.","Andrew Charles","So essentially, food costs should be flat then within that construct?","Pat Grismer","Andrew, we thought it would be about 1 point of inflation from a commodity standpoint for the year, if you're asking about 2016. Between flat and 1 point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff Farmer","Just a single follow-up on a handful of earlier questions. So I believe it was at your December Analyst Meeting you noted that Pizza Hut Casual Dining is listed with several of the online aggregators. I think you said the sales mix coming from those channels is something less than 5% mix. I'm just curious: do you expect that sales mix to grow? And then more broadly and more importantly, what's the longer-term strategy with those aggregators as you move forward and they potentially become a little bit more powerful?","Greg Creed","Jeff, I think to answer your question, they are still low with the percentage of the sales mix. I think in Q4 I think at KFC, they were about 2% of total sales. I think Pizza Hut Casual Dining was about 2% of total sales. I think Pizza Hut other service was about 30% of total sales, but obviously that's a small part of the pizza business. Yes, we are obviously working with these aggregators and we continue to participate with them. I think -- I would like to say they are now turned, so we don't lose the customer data or erode our brands in that process. So I think that's the critical part of the relationship is that the aggregators like working with big brands like us and we like obviously not -- making sure we keep our customer data and we make sure that we keep our plan positioning really clear in this marketplace.","Jeff Farmer","And just one final question in terms of just gauging momentum. I know it's hard to do across multiple concepts, but is this still building or are you getting to sort of a tipping point where maybe it's got about as far as -- gone about as far as it is going to go and then it maybe it sort of settles back down as we get deeper into 2016 or 2017? Or again, really is this still continuing to be a building competitive issue as you move forward?","Greg Creed","Do you mean aggregators?","Jeff Farmer","Yes.","Greg Creed","Yes. Look, I think, as I said, of the four factors that are impacting our business, when I spoke about earlier, I think for Pizza Hut, which were; macros, value, competition, and aggregators. I think they are the fourth. I think they will probably stay the fourth. I think our ability to deliver new value news in the marketplace will be a much greater driver of our improved performance than I see much growth with that. But it will continue to grow. There is no -- I'm not suggesting it won't continue to grow, but I think that because we have strong brands and the aggregators want to work with us as strong brands. I think that puts us in a more driver's seat in terms of how we play with them versus the small guys, who I think the aggregators will have different terms and arrangements with. So I feel good about where we are. I can tell you that the China team is all over it. Micky is very well versed. He's definitely met with the aggregators personally, so we're watching this. It will grow. But I think in that growth and value will be in the short term more important for us to address.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar. Your line is open.","R.J. Hottovy","Had a technology question. During the prepared remarks, you said you were pleased with the level of mobile engagement at the Taco Bell brand and the deliveries that may come out of that. I just wonder, if you had any additional color on that and kind of the quantitative measures that we might be able to look at? And then secondly, any kind of takeaways or learnings you can apply to either the rest of the U.S. or even potentially on a global basis from those technology endeavors?","Pat Grismer","Yes, I would say that we are very pleased with the progress we're making on the digital front at Taco Bell. You'll recall that we launched our Taco Bell app in the fourth quarter of 2014. To-date, we have about 5 million app downloads. When we look at the behavior of those customers who are ordering through the app, the average check is higher by about 30%. So we're very much encouraged by those early results. We are looking to build awareness of the app to drive utilization. And an important part of that is the introduction of a loyalty component to the app, a game. That was launched in late 2015. It's the first loyalty program of its kind that rewards social behavior and the first reward that was offered for customers who play the game was a free Taco Bell Freeze. So there is a lot of excitement around that. The app is also configured in a way that drives exploration of the menu. So it has helped to create a lot of buzz and a lot of active engagement with our heavy users, very high levels of social sharing of the rewards we've observed and the overall user response has been very positive. So the focus now is having launched the app and more recently, the loyalty program is to drive awareness. And so we do expect to see even greater trial in the coming months. The goal is, you know, for Taco Bell is to strengthen its position as an on-demand brand and so leveraging technology to do that is an important part of the brand's priority going forward.","Greg Creed","What I really love about it is the customization that is going on. We recently just got certified by the American Vegetarian Association for Taco Bell. And we can highlight that -- we probably can't run an ad on TV to highlight that, but using the app, we can. And it's really interesting to see that we are actually getting people customized out of beef and into beans as a protein. And from a margin point of view, that's really good for us. But it also makes the customer happy. So what I love is that we can use the mobile app as a vehicle to actually talk a more discreet story about the brand. It's a great story, it's a good story, but it's something we wouldn't traditionally do on mainstream TV. But we can use this to get that message out, and that's making the brand more relevant. And making any brand more relevant is the name of the game.","A - Steve Schmitt","Thanks, R.J. Okay two more questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Westra from Stifel. Your line is open.","Paul Westra","Two quick ones. One more on China. I was wondering, if you could give us general sales trends update on maybe where you saw some weaknesses or some strength by tiers or geographies or perhaps locations? And then second on Taco Bell. Was wondering, if you could give us a little bit more color on those G&A investments. What were they exactly? Can you confirm that the majority of the year-over-year spike in G&A at Taco Bell was of one-time nature, which you alluded to?","Pat Grismer","Certainly, Paul. So first on China same-store sales, similar to recent quarters, performance was stronger in Tier 1 cities at both brands. Our view is that customers in lower tier cities have been more significantly impacted by the softening economy, particularly around the industrial cities, which have been more heavily affected by China's slowing export trade. But that's the only meaningful difference really to call out. And then as it relates to Taco Bell's G&A, as we mentioned, the increase in the fourth quarter was expected and it's fair to characterize a large chunk of the incremental G&A as being nonrecurring. So some components would include performance-driven incentive compensation, because they had an absolute blockbuster year, and so they were paid accordingly. We plan for a 100% payout, so that contributes to a year-over-year decline as we think about 2016. There were some investments that were made and some strategic growth initiatives that would highlight international supply chain development. I would also highlight the digital initiatives, like the ones we just talked about. And so that contributed to a spike in the fourth quarter. And importantly, we think about those as investments to sustain the positive momentum of the brand. I think good businesses that are strong performing businesses reinvest profit upside to sustain the momentum and that's exactly what's happened at Taco Bell.","Greg Creed","The way I look at it, look the new plants that you -- trees that you plant and the ones that are growing both need water. You just can't throw water on the new plants. You got to throw water on the big strong trees to make sure they continue to be big, strong, and keep going. And that's what I saw in that investment in the fourth quarter. I'm glad we made it. I'm delighted we made it. It was the right thing to do, and you are going to see that in the performance of Taco Bell going forward.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Joseph Buckley","Thanks for squeezing me in. Two more questions on Pizza Hut China. First, you mentioned the smaller tier markets being hit harder by the macro. The Pizza Hut expansion numbers the last three or four years have been pretty aggressive, and have you extended the brand into areas where the economic development did not follow or are there cannibalization issues behind Pizza Hut? And then secondly in Pizza Hut, I know you mentioned a 20% reduction in expansion will be across both brands. But within Pizza Hut, how will that break down in financial plans for 2016 between home delivery and casual dining?","Pat Grismer","Yes, for -- first of all, I will address your last question first, Joe, and that is that the slowdown in development for the Pizza Hut brand is only for the casual dining business, not for the delivery business. And then as it relates to the performance of Pizza Hut across cities, I would not attribute variable performance to development decisions and higher than expected cannibalization necessarily. It would be more a function of variable levels of macro pressure across these cities.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. And Pat just to follow-up then. So the Casual Dining Pizza Hut expansion would be down much more than 20%, with the difference made up by faster home delivery? And what about the sales volume differences there in terms of trying to figure out the growth?","Pat Grismer","No Joe, the 20% -- the approximately 20% applies exclusively to the casual dining business. That's not a composite number for both businesses under the Pizza Hut banner.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. But it's 20% for both KFC and Pizza Hut or are they both\u2026","Pat Grismer","For KFC and for Pizza Hut Casual Dining. We are not slowing down the development of Pizza Hut home service.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. Will that accelerate the latter?","Pat Grismer","We are expecting it to be at least as much as we developed in 2015.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. Okay, thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Greg Creed","Okay. Well, I think that wraps it up. I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. Thank you for taking the time to be with us. And I know I've said this as well, but I do want to thank Pat. Pat joined Yum! at Taco Bell when I was the CMO and he was the Head of Strategic Planning. He has been a true friend. He has been a great resource. He has been a great leader, and I want to thank him. And I want to wish he and his family all the very best for the future. Thanks. Thanks everybody.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22810":["Yum! Brands, Inc.

The first will be Taco Bell, May 24 and 25, in Irvine, California.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone, Yum! Brands delivered: first quarter core operating profit growth of 9%; system sales growth of 5% in constant currencies; and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 17%. We are maintaining our full-year guidance of mid-single-digit core operating profit growth, which assumes high single digit underlying base operating profit growth, offset by 1.5 percentage point 53rd week headwind and another 1 to 2 percentage points headwind from the net timing impact of refranchising and associated G&A reductions.","With regards to our transformation, I'm pleased to report that we remain on track with our refranchising and cost saving initiatives. These efforts are elevating our organization into one that is more focused, more franchised, more efficient, and ultimately delivers more growth. This is why all of us at Yum! are realigning our efforts toward our four growth drivers: distinct relevant brands; unmatched franchise operating capability; bold restaurant development; and unrivaled culture and talent.","Today, I'll give examples of two of these growth drivers, unrivaled culture and talent and distinctive relevant brands. I'll then hand the call over to David Gibbs to provide more details on the quarter as well as an update on our two other growth drivers, unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development. Then, we'll open the call up to questions.","To begin, I truly can't emphasize enough how much of a competitive advantage our culture is to Yum!. At our Global Leaders Summit in March, we brought together our top 200 leaders in the organization to coauthor how we will think, act, and lead differently to accelerate growth. A transformation mindset has taken hold throughout the organization, a culture that fuels results. The energy and excitement behind our transformation is tangible. We've already seen many new and powerful ideas arise. And collaboration across brands has never been stronger, with an amplified effort on repeatable models. I'm confident our efforts to unlock the power of Yum! will benefit all stakeholders, from franchisees to shareholders to employees.","Now, I'd like to review Q1 results, beginning with KFC, which is our largest division, representing about 50% of our operating profit with nearly 21,000 restaurants in 128 countries. The division has consistently delivered top and bottom-line growth at an impressive rate. In the first quarter, total system sales grew 5%, driven by 4% net new unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, Australia and New Zealand and Latin America all grew same-store sales 6% or more, which was partially offset by France and the Middle East. All-in, solid sales in larger markets I just mentioned and firm G&A control across the division helped offset the operating profit dilution from refranchising. And core operating profits grew 13% for the quarter.","At KFC U.S., same-store sales grew 2% in the quarter, all of which was transaction growth, as Georgia Gold, Nashville Hot, consistent value and distinctive relevant marketing all benefited the quarter. This quarter marked 11 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth, a strong result by any measure.","I'd like to spend a couple more minutes on this business, not only because of its continued turnaround, but as an example of the types of bold transformational actions we are taking here at Yum! with lessons we can apply to Pizza Hut, as I'll discuss later.","The first step in the KFC U.S. turnaround was reaching a clear alignment with franchisees in early 2015 about the strategy and entering into an Acceleration Agreement, which we've discussed with you before. Second, was implementing the Re-Colonelization effort, operational excellence is at the core of success for any brand and it was for KFC's turnaround, as well, with ingredients and procedures held to a very high standard and with upgrades to equipment. Third, creative marketing around clear value constructs and innovation helped to make KFC a distinctive and relevant brand again.","Now, franchisees are investing in assets, adding new sales layers, and demand from new franchisees has spiked. This turnaround has been years in the making and required a lot of hard work, but restaurants are a momentum business, and I'm confident that we can carry the momentum forward.","On that note, it's those years of hard work that enabled us to introduce our global fan favorite, the Zinger spicy chicken sandwich in the U.S. last week. The Zinger has long been one of my single favorite items across the global Yum! portfolio. Unlike our competitors' products, it's hand-breaded in store for a crunchier, juicier, and more flavorful sandwich. Roughly 40% of the U.S. chicken category sales come from sandwiches. And we realize just how big an opportunity this is for KFC. With clear system alignment, excellent operations, proper sandwich equipment, and a distinctive and relative marketing, the time is right to launch this standout portable product. Kudos to Kevin Hochman and the team, and our newest Colonel, Rob Lowe, for some breakthrough work. While it may take some time to fully establish this new sales layer, we are extremely excited about its potential over the long term.","Switching to KFC International, I want to highlight an example of the power of Yum! in KFC's global delivery initiative, which we're aggressively pursuing as a strategic growth opportunity. We currently deliver out of almost 6,000 stores and plan to expand this rapidly over the next few years for many reasons. Not only do consumers want it, but KFC's product is ideal for delivery, as it holds temperature and quality remarkably well. Also, the vast majority of sales are incremental, since it captures a different consumer occasion. Yum! China is world class in developing a combined delivery and digital strategy and will host a Delivery Summit for the global KFC business in China to share learnings and adopt best practices, as we convert this into a repeatable model for all markets and an incremental multi-billion dollar sales layer.","Turning now to Pizza Hut, which represents about 20% of our operating profit with over 16,000 global restaurants, had flat first quarter system sales, as same-store sales declined 3% and net new units grew 2%. As you've heard from us before, we have two distinct businesses with Pizza Hut, International and the U.S. Our International business grew system sales by 6%, as same-store sales grew 1% and net new units grew 6% in the first quarter.","Implementation of our repeatable model for value, which originated in Thailand, is now seeing some success in additional markets, including Malaysia and Singapore, with positive early results in the Philippines. Broadly speaking, we are rolling out distinctive and disruptive value, coupled with the best-tasting food and consistent operations to sustainably and profitably grow top-line sales across all our markets. On the development front, we saw an acceleration of opens versus prior year, driven by a Development Agreement and a large number of conversions of Eagle Boys locations in Australia by our new franchise partner.","Our U.S. results, which currently represent approximately 10% of our operating profit, were disappointing. We were lapping a plus 5% from last year's $5 Flavor Menu, which made for a tough compare. But prior laps are never an excuse, and the continuation of the soft results are clearly a priority we are addressing with urgency.","As such, I'm very pleased to announce that in the past few days we secured an agreement with our franchisees to accelerate a bold transformation of the Pizza Hut U.S. business. This agreement will improve brand marketing alignment, accelerate enhancements to operations and technology, and include a permanent commitment to incremental advertising. This is a win-win agreement that importantly includes explicit alignment on aggressive investment in a digital delivery-centric strategy, and in short, will make it easier for our customers to get a better pizza.","David is going to go into more detail about this significant milestone for the brand in a few minutes, but I would like to point out that this is another great example of the power of Yum!. We were able to leverage important learnings from the transformation work at KFC U.S. over the past few years to enable the system to make critical step-chain investments and to reset the business. It is working at KFC, and we believe this breakthrough can unlock renewed growth at Pizza Hut in the U.S.","as well.","I'd like to thank the Pizza Hut franchisees for supporting this bold vision for the brand, as well as the entire Pizza Hut U.S. team, led by Artie Starrs, for their monumental efforts that led to this agreement. As with all turnarounds, this is a journey that will happen hand-in-hand with our franchise partners, and it will not be complete in 2017, but I do believe you will see the results pay off in 2018 and beyond, so stay tuned.","Finally, Taco Bell started the year with very impressive results and is well on pace for its sixth consecutive year of same-store sales growth. System sales grew 12%, as same-store sales grew 8% and net new units grew 3%. Same-store sales growth was driven by 5% transaction growth at Taco Bell, outpacing the industry by 7 points on sales and about 6 percentage points on transactions. 35 net new unit openings set a first quarter record and core operating profit grew 19%. These are remarkable results that showcase how a truly distinctive, relevant brand, world-class operations, consistent innovation, and a creative approach to value can resonate with customers.","To this point, our three key products in the first quarter reflected these themes and were received with tremendous enthusiasm by the consumer. First, we launched the $1 Double Stacked Tacos, which provided us with early momentum in the quarter. We then sold over 25 million Naked Chicken Chalupas, which illustrates the enthusiasm for our crispy chicken offerings. And finally, we brought back the Triple Double Crunchwrap, which was even more successful than its initial launch in 2016. Our high-low value strategy is working, achieving both price, value, and abundant value. Going forward, you can expect to see continued focus on innovation and value with our $1.49 Loaded Taco Beef Burrito and more Naked products in the second quarter.","On the Taco Bell International front, I am pleased with the momentum building globally and with both growing enthusiasm for the brand and improving economics. We continue unlocking the business model by driving cost out of the supply chain and building scale with new and existing franchisees. This year, we expect to open restaurants in five new countries as we expand the cult of Taco Bell. We continue to sign Development Agreements and now have commitments for nearly 400 new restaurants under these agreements, including 100 from Yum! China, where things are off to a very encouraging start. Interest has remained strong from high quality existing and potential new franchisees across the globe. So, in summary, we are accelerating our growth as we engage long-term partners aligned with our vision, values, and passion for Taco Bell.","In conclusion, we're moving forward with clear intentionality towards building a growth-oriented organization which delivers more for our shareholders. I'm very pleased with the progress made to-date, and look forward to further updating you as we continue our transformation journey.","And now, our President and CFO, David Gibbs.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover four areas in my following remarks: our first quarter operating results; our transformation commitments, specifically how we are driving growth through our focus on unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development; our Pizza Hut U.S. Transformation Agreement; and our outlook for 2017.","We are pleased with our first quarter results, where core operating profit increased 9%. These results were led by particular strength at Taco Bell, with better than expected sales and margins and solid double-digit core operating profit growth in our KFC Division. First quarter results were a strong testament to the diversity and resiliency of the Yum! Portfolio, as core operating profits grew in line with our long-term target, despite headwinds in Pizza Hut U.S. sales.","EPS, before special items, grew 17%, including a 1 point negative impact from foreign currency. EPS benefited from a low tax rate associated with the new standard for equity compensation accounting, which we adopted in the first quarter. Please note that the first quarter tax rate includes an oversized impact related specifically to payouts to recently-retired employees. The new accounting standard will make it harder to predict our tax rate, given the uncertainty around timing of equity compensation payouts; however, we do expect our full year ex-special tax rate to be closer to our rate of recent years.","We are on track to achieve our 2019 targets of: reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales; increasing free cash flow conversion to 100%; and increasing our franchise mix to at least 98%. The more predictable factors helping us to reach our targets, refranchising efforts, net units, G&A reductions, and share buybacks, are all well underway and our early success is encouraging.","In the first quarter of 2017, we refranchised 121 stores, including 31 KFCs, 36 Pizza Huts, and 54 Taco Bells, bringing our global franchise mix to 94%. Simply put, refranchising these stores allows us to meet three of our stated goals: decreasing our ownership mix; reducing field-level G&A; and returning cash to shareholders. While we won't provide interim targets as we work towards reaching our new franchise mix of at least 98%, I do want to share that there has been robust demand for all three brands in the U.S. and abroad.","Next, I'd like to briefly touch on how we are executing against two of our four growth drivers: bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. First, as we have discussed in the past, we are aggressively leveraging our renewed focus on bold restaurant development by attaching Development Agreements to our refranchising deals. Since we own the market-mapping capability for each brand and geography, we know how many stores to include in our agreements. Deals in the first quarter included meaningful Development Agreements, creating a strong pipeline of net new unit development. And with healthy demand from existing and new franchisees for our brands around the world, we expect this pipeline to grow.","This quarter was a good example of how our transformation mindset can benefit results. We opened 141 net new units in the first quarter, which is typically the seasonally-weakest quarter of the year. Actually, 141 net new opens is 113 higher than first quarter 2016 and each of our three brands saw improvement. KFC contributed the largest portion of the year-over-year improvement, owing to strong brand momentum and economics. Pizza Hut's master franchise partner in Australia converted Eagle Boys to Pizza Huts, and Taco Bell set a record for first quarter openings.","Second, even as we're reducing our company-operated store holdings, I want to be clear that operations excellence is as important, if not more important, than ever. And this is a large part of what our unmatched franchise operating capability growth driver refers to. I'd like to highlight some of the significant operational achievements we've made across the portfolio as examples of our commitment to this strategic priority.","At Taco Bell, customer satisfaction hit an all-time high during the Naked Chicken Chalupa launch and continues to hold strong. Pizza Hut International's overall satisfaction scores in the first quarter increased 6 percentage points versus the prior year. This was highlighted by a 10 percentage point increase in Korea, with significantly improving speed and taste scores. The global KFC business achieved a 7% improvement in taste satisfaction over the past 12 months, while 14% fewer guests experienced a problem in 2016 than 2015.","Now, I'd like to update you on our capital structure and share buybacks. As you may have seen, we successfully repriced our $2 billion term loan B in March. This reduced the associated interest rate by 75 basis points, which, after amortization of related fees and expenses, will reduce our ongoing reported annualized interest expense by about $12 million. For 2017, the net interest savings will be approximately $3 million, due to the partial year benefit of the lower rate and incremental fees and debt issuance costs, $6 million of which we recognized in the first quarter. We remain committed to maintaining approximately 5 times leverage as market conditions permit, and we are always working to optimize the capital structure, as evidenced here.","As for share buybacks, we repurchased 6.8 million shares for $442 million or, on average, about $65 per share in the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we had just under $1.5 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. As we laid out at our analyst meeting, our plan is to return between $6.5 billion and $7 billion to shareholders across 2017 through 2019. Through a combination of free cash flow generation, maintaining our leverage, and cash from refranchising, we will continue to return capital to shareholders to deliver on our commitment.","Before we discuss the outlook, I'd like to provide some financial highlights of the agreement we reached with our Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees. Yum! will invest approximately $130 million to upgrade restaurant equipment to improve operations, accelerate improvements in restaurant technology, enhance digital and eCommerce capabilities, and boost advertising dollars. Further, the Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees overwhelmingly voted in support of this agreement. And while we aren't going to get into specifics for competitive reasons, the agreement includes a permanent system commitment to incremental advertising and digital initiative contributions, alignment on marketing strategy, and much more. From a timing perspective, we expect to invest nearly all of the $130 million split between 2017 and 2018.","Similar to our KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement, due to the unique long-term brand-building nature of these investments, certain of these investments will be classified as special items. Of the expenses that will be treated as ex-special and recognized through our income statement, the only significant item we want to highlight relates to media spend, which we estimate will be approximately $25 million in 2017 and $12.5 million in 2018. Although this is a relatively modest investment in the scheme of Yum!, it is obviously quite significant to Pizza Hut U.S. and we are confident it will unlock significant value in years to come.","Finally, I'd like to discuss our 2017 outlook, which, as Greg mentioned, is unchanged. Please note this is off of our quarterly 2016 income statement filed April 13, which adjusts for the China spin-off, our quarterly calendar change, and the change to pension expense classification which we adopted this quarter. To be clear, the ex-special operating profit base for 2016 is $1.647 billion. We forecast 2017 core operating profit should grow mid-single digits off this base, as the 53rd week lap and timing mismatches on refranchising and G&A savings impact what we believe will be a high single-digit-base underlying growth rate. And to be clear, the incremental cost associated with the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement will not alter our full-year guidance, given our strong start to the year.","So, to wrap things up, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the progress we continue to make on implementing our strategic transformation. First quarter operating profit growth was a strong and encouraging start to the year, reinforcing our confidence in the strength of our business model. We are taking the right steps to optimize shareholder value, and our disciplined decisions will set us up for strength in the near and long term.","And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Hi, John.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, can you hear me okay?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Hi, John, how are you?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Good morning.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good. I'm fine, thank you. First, can you just comment, David and Greg, you commented about your new Development Agreements with franchisees and that's key as you refranchise and accelerate growth. If you think about your refranchising goals over the next couple of years, how much incremental development, if you were to successfully attach those agreements to all of them, how much of that would incrementally expand unit growth versus the 3% we saw this quarter? Would it get you to 5%, for example, or is that just part of the solution to getting to that 7% system goal and some component of that's unit growth?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think, as you described, John, it's really a big part of the solution to getting to incremental development. As we've talked about before, we're not going to throw out new targets for development, but the Development Agreements that we're signing from refranchising this time around with our refranchising are really quite incremental versus the previous efforts of refranchising, where we didn't undertake these kinds of Development Agreements.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then as a follow-up, just on the Pizza Hut agreement, can you, first of all, just make clear what it is going toward? For example, are you funding some asset relocations in the United States? How much of that is a component versus the technology investment? If you could maybe provide a little clarity. I just want to make sure I understand. This is going to be reflected all in CapEx in 2017 and 2018 or some of it comes through the P&L or if there is a breakdown, can you break that down?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, look, I'm going to let David give you some more details. Let me just give you the context of why we've made this decision on Pizza Hut and why we have signed up for the Acceleration Agreement, because I think having this context is important for everybody.","If I step back two or three years, I think we've made a number of, what I call, focused bold decisions. Early 2015, along with the KFC franchisees, we reached the Acceleration Agreement in which we said we would invest $180 million through 2018. I think that's demonstrated clearly to be a wise investment. We've had 11 quarters of consecutive same-store sales growth, margins have doubled.","We then separated China, as we all know. We've created these two powerful independent-focused growth companies, I think another wise decision. Around the transformation of Yum! we've set these four growth drivers, we believe, will obviously enhance our growth going forward. And now, we're focusing on another bold action, which is the Transformation Agreement with the Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees. As David said, it's a $130 million investment. From a Yum! point of view, it's modest. For a Pizza Hut point of view, yes, it's significant.","And, well, I'll let David explain the details, I'm very confident that, like the other three bold actions, it will unlock significant value and long-term growth for years to come. It's the right thing to do for the Pizza Hut brand.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, and on the financial side, as I mentioned, we're doing a little bit of priming the pump on the incremental media. And we'll be investing $25 million in incremental media from Yum! in 2017 and then another $12.5 million in 2018. There's an ongoing permanent commitment to incremental media from the franchisees that goes on after that. So, every other part of the investment would really be, at this point, classified as special. So, I think for your modeling purposes, you'll see that $25 million and $12 million (sic) [$12.5 million] (29:02) hit through our income statement.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. I have a follow-up on Pizza Hut. At Pizza Hut in the U.S., there's a big picture issue of kind of having these restaurants in the old format, which sounds like part of this plan is to fix some of that. But what are the near-term fixes or solutions that you can address to get in place so that you can revert the comps back to a more positive state over the course of this year? I know we're kind of looking for a home run solution over time, but what are the, I guess, singles and doubles that you can hit over the course of 2017?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, I think what we've got to do is make sure the brand has what I call a delivery digital-centric focus. Obviously, there will continue to be active upgrades. It was interesting. Dave and I were out and touring a number of markets the last couple of weeks looking at the Zinger, looking at some asset actions that we've taken at Pizza Hut, and it was very clear. We were in one place and we've shut down an old Red Roof about half a mile down the road from what is now a fast-casual Delco end cap and I think sales \u2013 I may be wrong, have gone something like $14,000 to $29,000, or something like that. So, I think the assets will change.","I think making sure that when we advertise a price point, we've got that consistently on air across the country, having the franchisees align behind that. In the past, we've not had necessarily great commitment, so I think part of it is making sure that when we play a value play, that every customer across the whole country gets the benefit of that. I think those are just some of the advantages that you'll see.","We don't want to get into too much of the messaging that's going to occur, because obviously, this is a very cutthroat and competitive category. And I really don't want to get into the messages we're going to put out there. I just want to say that I feel very good about the messages we've got coming. I think they will resonate with customers. They will reinforce a delivery, sort of digital-centric nature, and the customers will see it as a more consistent expression across the country.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","On the asset front, you asked about the assets. We have, as we've mentioned it before, we've started ramping up the pace of remodeling over a year ago as part of another agreement with our franchisees. That agreement will be modified but continue over the next several years and you'll continue to see us accelerate the pace of fixing our stores.","There will be incentives for what Greg was referring to, which is the fast-casual delco model, which we're quite excited about, given the sales bump we get from that versus other asset actions. So, I think, as Greg said, there's a lot of competitive information here that we can't reveal, but there is a plan along every critical front in the battle in the pizza category, whether it be operations, technology, or assets or advertising.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead.","Dennis P. Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Greg, you've talked in the past about how an increased focus on sales can have a real notable impact on results as you complete the refranchising, as you don't have to focus on costs within the four walls as much. Granted, we're not quite there yet on the refranchising, but is the organization already preparing for that greater top-line focus? And how important of a factor do you think it was in what you saw at Taco Bell and KFC this quarter and in recent quarters?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. As I said in my prepared remarks, in March, we had a Global Leadership Summit. We took the top 200 leaders from around the world. And I think to keep it simple, we discussed the sort of the what and the why. So, we were very clear about the what, which is we're going to be more focused, more franchised, more efficient, and that we were going to accelerate growth by thinking differently, acting differently, and leading differently.","David also gave a great example of why we need to do that from a financial point of view. And I came away incredibly excited that the top 200 leaders in the organization are rallying around the fact that we can get more growth out of this business. And so, it was great to obviously see the Taco Bell numbers are simply stunning. I mean, 8% same-store sales growth, 5% coming from transactions. Even the U.S. KFC business, which was up 2%, but it was 2% transaction growth. And I like sales that come predominantly from transaction growth rather than from pricing. And so, I'm very encouraged by the early start. We have a long way to go, but I do believe that we can consistently grow system sales through a combination of focus around same-store sales and focus around net new units.","Dennis P. Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys, had two questions on Taco Bell. The comps are, obviously, stellar this quarter, but wanted to ask about the 80 bps of restaurant margin expansion. It just didn't seem to fully reflect the strong comps. And I know you guys did some value promotions, which were more margin-dilutive, but I would have figured that would have been offset by some of the premium innovation you did around Naked Chicken and the Triple Double.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, there was some cost of sales and labor inflation in the numbers, but offset by better sales. So, I think the good news is we did get margin expansion. Last year, cost of sales at Taco Bell ran negative. They'll probably run slightly positive, around 2%, this year. Now that's coming off, I think, minus about mid-single digits last year. So, there was some inflation in labor. There was some inflation in cost of sales, but the good news was more than offset by the strength in the top-line.","And, as I said, continuing to bring innovation to the marketplace, continue to be strong on value, as David said, improving operations. Again, we have been out visiting restaurants and the Taco Bells we visited, I think, were all A's. I mean, we just saw great execution. These were blind visits. No one was expecting us. Mike Grams is doing a great job improving the operating performance there, as well. So, it's world-class advertising, breakthrough innovation, great value, great operations, all of that offsetting what was some underlying labor and cost of goods inflation in the quarter.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","And my follow-up question was just on the fluidity of the marketing calendar. Obviously, you guys have done a nice job of balancing premium, like Naked Chicken with some value offers. Should we expect that to continue or do you remain fluid, just given the operating environment that you can lean more into one factor or the other, depending on the environment and competitive actions?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I mean, the great thing is Taco Bell's got a calendar for the next couple of years, so as things happen in the marketplace \u2013 I mean, let's not kid ourselves. You'll see more \"naked\" products. We'd be crazy not to. But you'll always see Taco Bell doing price value. You'll see them doing breakfast. We've got good transaction growth out of breakfast again. Two year comps, I think, were like 12% on transaction growth at breakfast. So, they're doing everything right. And they have a pipeline that if anything happened, they could react to flexibly, but right now, they're executing their strategy and they're doing an incredible job executing it really well.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, thanks. I think you guys put up 9% core EBIT growth in the quarter and you're guiding \u2013 I think the equivalent for the year is mid-single digits on that number. I know you're lapping the 53rd week in 4Q, but is there any other reason why the business will slow a bit from here?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, one of the other headwinds that we've highlighted is just the timing mismatch between when we're cutting G&A and getting savings versus the loss of operating profit from refranchising. I think on the last call, I highlighted that that worked in our favor last year. This quarter, those two things were about neutral. So, you see us performing at about our base underlying rate, since we don't have a 53rd week this quarter and we don't have that issue. But, as the year progresses, that will be the headwind that we described entering the year.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, got it. And then, just a follow-up on Pizza Hut, I guess looking at the comp trends there, obviously quite a bit different from the two big competitors in the U.S. As you guys dig into those comps and look at your dine-in business versus the kind of core delivery business, is that at least a lot closer to where competitors are, just on the delivery side or are you really sort of similar on both sides of the business, because I know that dine-in has been a big overhang on that story?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, we don't want to get into the specifics, but our delivery performance is better than our dine-in performance, obviously, but I think the key thing is we have a long way to go. There's a lot of difference between where we are and where we need to be. And I'm really excited that this Pizza Hut Acceleration Agreement will help us get there. It was the catalyst for change at KFC. I mean, if I step back \u2013 and I think most of you, when I took over this job, thought we'd take the under on a KFC U.S. turnaround. Hopefully, we've proven that we turned that around. And I'm equally confident that with this Pizza Hut Acceleration Agreement in place, we can do the same thing for Pizza Hut as we've done for KFC.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, great. I'd like to stay on Pizza Hut, if I may. I think you ended 2016 with around 7,600 units. And that's versus Domino's at around 5,400 or so. So just in terms of looking at the number of units that you have, what should it be, I mean, if you were to kind of redraw the entire map of the United States and you wanted to have delivery and carry-out focused assets and maximize return at those assets, as part of the Pizza Hut restructuring or significant reduction in that unit count to get to kind of redraw the United States as it stands today?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, John, this is David. Just one point on the unit count for clarity; some of the 7,600 units that we have are licensed units versus the 5,400 that Domino's owns. (39:34)","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Yes, and that's probably not totally fair of me to include that, but I don't have that number in front of me. What is that?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Our traditional unit count is more in the 6,300 to 6,400 unit range, but your question about the future asset base of the brand is a good one. I think as we pointed out in last investor discussions, new unit development for Pizza Hut still generates good returns. It's one of our better returning programs that we have because of the small box cost. We're excited about some of the new vehicles we've developed with the fast-casual Delco. And we certainly don't think that Pizza Hut should be shrinking in the United States. We think it can get back to being a growth concept. And we've market mapped out further opportunities to grow our brand in the United States.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, very interesting. And by not shrinking, could there just be the replacement of one legacy Red Roof that's closed, but just replaced by a Delco nearby? I mean, is that part of the overall strategy, if you don't want to actually lose some presentation in the market?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. I think that the big part of the strategy is relocating out of many of those Red Roofs, which not only are the assets not in great shape, but oftentimes, they're in the wrong part of the trade area. Greg referenced that on our trip a couple of weeks ago, we visited one of these stores where the trade area had clearly moved away from our Red Roof, where we were doing half the volume that we eventually ended up doing just by moving a half mile down the road to where more of the activity is.","Now, it's not to say that there also won't, over the short-term, be a little bit of churn in the asset base. And you'll see some closures and some openings, so I can't predict the timing of the net new units, probably, over the next year or so. But I can say that the Pizza Hut team and we feel confident that there's growth opportunities for the Pizza Hut brand in the U.S., both in growing the top-line of our existing units, relocating them to more powerful assets, and penetrating new trade areas.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think there's areas where we're not very well penetrated. The Northeast is not a highly-penetrated Pizza Hut market. I think talking to new franchisees signing development agreements in those parts of the country, I think will be a positive to the brand. And as the brand builds its top-line momentum, which we believe we will deliver, I think that will only make people even more encouraged. The good thing is we're not short of people who want to sign on to be Pizza Hut franchisees. The good news is that we've got new franchisees who believe in the story that we're selling, who know more of the details that we can't share, are signing up. And I think that's encouraging and an encouraging sign for us, as well.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, if I may, you quantified your investment over 2017 and 2018 for the Pizza Hut brand in the U.S., the $130 million. Could you put some context around what the incremental investment is from the franchise community? Is it a similar number? Is it many multiples of that number? Just so we get a sense of how much money is being put across the entire brand, not just from your wallet in 2017 and 2018.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, we're not going to share specifics on that, but what I can say is they'll be investing in incremental media. They'll be investing along with us in incremental technology investments. So, this is not as if it's a one-sided investment. That's why we're all, obviously, so excited about the agreement. We all know that the partnership between the brand and the franchisees has to be right to get a business to grow. That's what we have at KFC U.S. And I think this is good evidence that the Pizza Hut franchisees and the Pizza Hut brand leadership are working in concert to bring the brand forward.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Yet another Pizza Hut question for the day, just looking at the reported company store margins, are those reflective of what the system as a whole is seeing or would there be a reason that there is a mix difference between your owned units and franchisees?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think given that Pizza Hut has light company ownership, the margins can be a little misleading. The margins in the U.S. are actually better than the margins shown there. So, the margins are somewhat pulled down by international markets with new equity stores and preopening expenses and things like that. And obviously, off of a very light number, I wouldn't read too much in it. Obviously, margins are down in the U.S. business because of the decline in sales, that's certain. But, yeah, I think the overall Pizza Hut business still has, for our franchise partners and for us, has solid margins, which we certainly believe we can grow.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then on the development side of things, when you're working with franchisees on attaching new unit development to refranchising and what not, what sort of return hurdles do you think they're looking for in the U.S. to be incentivized to build?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I think it really varies by franchisee in concept, but certainly the development trade areas that we've identified as part of these agreements are ones that we think meet the hurdle requirements. And for our brands, that probably ranges from cash paybacks from three to eight years, something like that.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, good morning, guys. Are you guys still confident in your journey to achieve the $3.75 of EPS by 2019? I didn't hear that in your prepared remarks. And if you are, do you still think you need an average of 5% system-wide sales growth to get there, or does it need to be more towards the 7% that you're targeting?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think we are confident in our journey towards $3.75 that you mentioned. And I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that all of our transformation initiatives are on track, with encouraging results.","We've never actually thrown out a specific sales number that underlies the $3.75, other than saying that it's more like our historical rate of growth. So, I think we're excited by some of the things we're seeing at Taco Bell and the Transformation Agreement and the ability over the next few years for our sales to accelerate for all of the reasons we've talked about. But as I often point out, a lot of the stuff in getting to the $3.75 is completely under our control, share buybacks, refranchisings...","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","G&A.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","G&A cuts. All of those initiatives we feel really good about.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And Taco Bell doesn't seem to be getting too much attention today. I mean, 8% comps. When you look at that quarter, how much of that 5% traffic do you think was driven by kind of hot LTO's or how much do you think was more kind of sustained demand growth that the Taco Bell brand is swallowing? If you can maybe just give a little more color on that.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","They just had a great quarter. January was good. February was good. March was good. This wasn't like Naked Chicken sort of saved the quarter, and what you could save plus-8%. It was a strong across the board. We have high-low going with the $1 Double Stacked Tacos, and then the Triple Double Crunchwrap. You've got innovation in Naked Chicken Chalupa, improving operations, I think world-class marketing. I do believe that the team had turned this into a cult brand. And it's not hard to turn a $10 billion mass brand into a cult brand, but I believe they've done it. So, they had just a incredibly strong quarter, every day, every week, every month. And that's what gives us encouragement that they're doing everything right to continue to grow this business for the long long-term.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","And just the last question I have is the KFC turnaround, from the outside looking in, it felt like the advertising changes did a lot to kind of pump up the brand a lot more than it was prior. Do you have the same advertising agencies that work on the KFC brand that work on the Pizza Hut brand? Are those kind of crossed or do you have separate advertising agencies?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","No, each of the brands has a separate agency. I do agree with you that I think the Colonel campaign was a core part of why we've had a lot of success in the U.S., but, at the same time, product availability, improving operations, there's a lot of things that go into place. Definitely the Colonel campaign has worked, but to answer your question specifically, each agency in the U.S. uses a different agency. Each brand uses a different agency.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. On your efforts to accelerate system unit growth, can you provide more color on the international markets where you've seen that early traction, as well as some of the strategies that are driving that developmental acceleration? Again, just trying to get a better understanding of some of the early successes you've had and the drivers of that early success.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Jeff, was this regarding Pizza Hut? I just missed the first part of your question.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Really, across all brands, it's development in terms of just accelerating development internationally, where you've gained traction, and it doesn't have to be about Pizza Hut. I'd love it if it was Pizza Hut, but across either Pizza Hut or KFC.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think we're seeing, across the board, good net new unit growth on both KFC and on Pizza Hut. On the Pizza Hut side, we measure 13 distinct markets. I think 6 are developing and 7 have developed. And of those, 12 of the 13 had system sales growth in the quarter, the only exception being the U.S. So, I do believe we're seeing strong net new unit growth. Internationally, we delivered 6% net new unit growth in the quarter, which was a strong number, and I think KFC also delivered 4% net new unit growth. So, it's quite strong.","I think, as David said, what we love is we're keeping control of the asset-mapping process. We're not giving that to the franchisees. So we're out there, we have mapped the world. We know where there's opportunities. And I think, as David said, we know that net new units is something we can control as towards our growth targets. And because the business is much more focused, as I said earlier, we're focused on four things, distinct relevant brands, unmatched franchise operating capability, bold asset development, and culture and talent. And I think because the organization is more focused, you are seeing us make progress on a broader scale than we had probably in the past.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Let me just ask it one more way, so any new strategies or learnings coming out of that global leadership conference in terms of how to accelerate development with your partners?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Look, yeah, I think a big part of this is changing our mindset on development and really starting to think about every market, emerging and developed, as a great opportunity for us, because we've seen even in developed markets that our brands can get to much greater penetration. I mean, I mentioned in my prepared remarks on Pizza Hut, our master franchisee down in Australia just took, I think, close to 50 Eagle Boys restaurants and converted them to Pizza Huts. That's great growth in the developed market.","At the same time, the Pizza Hut team is out striking a deal in Ethiopia to expand into a new country. So, you're seeing that across the board. And the Global Leadership Summit that Greg talked about was a great opportunity to really galvanize the team on this deal-making and growth mindset. And you should continue to see things like Eagle Boys and Ethiopia and new market entry and new deals come across the wire as we start to ramp up the pace of development.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I mean, we have more Development Agreements for Taco Bell internationally than we have Taco Bells on the ground internationally. We've never been in that situation. We don't have 400 Taco Bells on the ground, but we have 400 Development Agreements, 100 with China. So, I'm with David. I think it's about being focused. We are really focused on distinct relevant brands. Why? Because that drives same-store sales. Unmatched franchise operating capability. Why? That drives same-store sales. Bold asset development. Why? Because that drives net new units. Focusing on those three things will drive system sales. And I think everyone came away from the global summit \u2013 the word is focused. That's what I'm going to stick with, and I honestly believe that this focus is going to pay off for us, for our shareholders, for our franchisees, and employees.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have two questions, one on KFC and then a follow-up on Pizza Hut. So on KFC, I know you had strong transaction growth in the U.S. and ahead of the industry, but globally, if I look at your comps of 2%, they were perhaps a little lower than what maybe your large QSR competitor is doing. So just trying to understand whether that should accelerate; you mentioned delivery, if that's the real driver going forward or if there are other places where maybe you can get to something closer to like a 3% comp, which I think would be kind of at the high end of your 2% to 3% for this year expectation.","And then I wanted to ask about Pizza Hut and value. And, in particular, you mentioned messaging better around price point. And I'm trying to understand if that's what you did last year so successfully. So, you're lapping the 5% comp last year with the $5 Cravings menu. Is that what drove it? And if so, isn't that a lever that you can pull pretty quickly while you're undertaking all these longer-term digital initiatives? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Sure, okay, so to take the KFC one first. I think, as I said in the call, in places like Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, we had more than 6% same-store sales growth. Now, as we said, it was offset by businesses in France and the Middle East. I can assure you my discussions with Roger Eaton are all about how do we use repeatable model to drive underlying same-store sales growth. We talked about the delivery summit that we're going to hold in China. That was really a collaboration between Roger and Micky about Roger saying he does believe that there is more growth upside from delivery.","We've got a test going in the UK right now on delivery where in, I think, about 89 stores are testing delivery, are seeing some early positive results to that test. So, I think using the repeatable model, leveraging the power of Yum! by, in this case, taking a delivery summit with the China team and then leveraging off what some of the strong markets, consistently strong markets, I mean, Russia, Australia, Central and Eastern Europe, they've consistently delivered way above 3% same-store sales growth. So, taking those learnings, converting into repeatable models; I can assure you Roger is very focused on all of those things. So, I feel good that we can take that number from 2%-plus you said closer to 3%, which would be a nice thing.","On the Pizza Hut side, yeah, I think the value discussion was less about the value price point. It was about everyone sort of, I guess, living up to the value price point in the marketplace. And we've had some price points on television that not everybody when the customer goes to order online has been able to take the benefit. And part of what this agreement is about is getting ourselves aligned that everyone honors the price point that's on television or on digital or social. So, that will be a change.","I don't want to get again into the actual details of the specifics, but I do like the fact that we'll have more of the system aligned behind what the message is that we're delivering in any particular time. Hopefully, that will happen in the short-term, but, as we said, we've got a lot to do on Pizza Hut. This agreement is really just a catalyst to get it all going. And, as we said, we'll hopefully see improvements later this year and obviously into next year. So, a lot of work to do, but I think we're doing all of the right things and the KFC agreement is the reason to believe.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Operator, given that we're closing in on the hour, we'll take one more question, please. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. Just a handful of clarification questions on the guidance for this year, so, David, I guess, first, what are you thinking, as you sit here today, about the FX impact on the year? Just so we can get an idea of what the reported operating income might look like, including the FX headwind.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, going into the year, I think our expectations was around $25 million or so. First quarter came in a little bit lighter than that run rate, and forward rates would indicate something along those lines.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Around the $25 million or lighter than the $25 million?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, like I said, we were a little bit lighter in the first quarter, but I don't think we're that precise on predicting FX, but $25 million is probably a good number to use.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, I don't think you confirmed your comps guidance for the year, but can you please confirm that it is still 2% to 3% is what you're thinking globally? And then, if that's the case, I guess, how are you thinking about the composition of that across the segments? Are you thinking \u2013 you obviously delivered that in the first quarter, but with a wide range of outcomes, with Taco Bell very strong and Pizza Hut weak. Is that kind of how we should expect to see it for the rest of the year or how are you thinking that will play out?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","There are not going to be any change to our guidance for the year, as far as individual brands and breaking it down. We're not going to provide that level of detail, but certainly you can see from the results from the first quarter and extrapolate from there.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I guess maybe I'll ask it differently then. I guess how would you characterize the degree of difficulty in hitting that 2% comp guidance if Taco Bell comes back to earth, so to speak?","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","David, this is Keith. I think the point here is we continue to be comfortable, at this point in the year, with a full-year global same-store sales growth rate at the 2% to 3%. You can see there's different ways we can get there. This quarter was a good example. And we remain comfortable with that range of guidance for the full year. at this time.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Okay, so I want to thank everyone for being on the call. As I said, I think we've had a strong start to the year. And I'm going to leave you all with my bet for the 143rd running of the Kentucky Derby. It's Irish War Cry. So, if you back it and win, I'm a genius. If you back it and lose, I don't want to hear about it.","Thanks for being on the call. A solid start to the year; we believe we're going to have a good year. We're very excited about the Pizza Hut Acceleration Agreement. And I think if we can continue to have the Taco Bell brand perform, the KFC brand perform and then we see the upside of the Pizza Hut Acceleration Agreement, I think the long term looks bright. I'm still very encouraged that the transformation of Yum! is well underway, and we will deliver on everything that we've promised. So, thanks for being on the call, appreciate it.

Sir, you may begin.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Novak, chairman and CEO; Rick Carucci, president; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. Following remarks from David and Pat, we will take your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.","In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum!

This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.","Finally, we would like you to be aware of a couple of upcoming Yum! investor events. First, our 2th New York investor and analyst comes from will be Wednesday, December 4, in Midtown Manhattan. Second, our 2013 fourth quarter earnings release will be Monday, February 3.","With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. David Novak.","David Novak ","All right, Steve, thank you very much and good morning everyone. There are three key messages I want you to take away from our call this morning. Number one, we are very disappointed with our overall third quarter results, and the fact we now believe China same-store sales will unlikely be positive for the fourth quarter. Frankly, these results are well below the high expectations we have for our business.","Number two, there were some bright spots in the quarter, and we\u2019re pleased with Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China, overall China restaurant margin, international development momentum, and Taco Bell. And number three, despite current challenges, we remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver strong, sustainable growth in the years to come.","For the third quarter, earnings per share, excluding special items, declined 15% versus prior year. This included a 10 point adverse impact from a higher tax rate, driven by an increase in our tax reserves.","Additionally, based on KFC China sales for September, which is part of the China division\u2019s fourth quarter, and a less than expected sales lift from the launch of our new beef burger, it\u2019s now unlikely that China division\u2019s same-store sales will be positive for Q4, although we do expect to show improvement.","Obviously, we are falling short of our Q4 guidance of positive same-store sales growth. We\u2019re now estimating a high single to low double digit percentage decline in full year EPS, excluding special items.","We also recorded a significant noncash special item charge in the third quarter for the writedown of Little Sheep intangibles. While we\u2019re deeply disappointed with our Little Sheep results so far, the team is taking steps to strengthen the concept and improve operations and we remain confident that we\u2019ll create a significant value over the long term through new unit development in China\u2019s large and extremely popular hot pot restaurant category.","If you\u2019ve followed us over the years, you know that our target has always been consistent dynasty-like performance, growing at least 10% year after year. And in fact, the business accomplishment we\u2019re most proud of is that prior to this year we delivered double digit EPS growth for 11 consecutive years. This places Yum! Brands among an elite group of companies to deliver this track record of performance.","Now, we\u2019ve certainly been humbled by this year\u2019s performance, but I want you to know that we are confident and determined to reestablish our track record of sustainable growth in the years to come.","I also want to assure you that we\u2019re working very hard right now to recover from the one-two punch of the China poultry supply incident in December and the unexpected bout of avian flu in the spring. Let me share with you some of the actions we\u2019re taking over the next few months to continue to rebuild consumer trust at KFC China and gain more sales and profit momentum as we enter 2014, which we expect will be a bounce back year for Yum! Brands.","Our number one priority at KFC China is to build and reinforce positive consumer perceptions around the safety of our food, and while our key brand attributes have improved significantly from where they were in the first few months following the December incident, the fact is that they remain below 2012 levels. The KFC brand is showing its resilience and we\u2019re confident that a full recovery is in store, but more time and effort are required.","So in November, our plans are to launch what we\u2019re calling our \u201cI Commit\u201d campaign. We expect this to be a powerful new quality assurance campaign featuring actual representatives of our over 300,000 KFC employees, suppliers, and poultry farmers in China. Our quality assurance message will be delivered in an authentic manner, and will be centered on the theme that KFC is safe for my family, friends, and me, and hence safe for you.","We are also leveraging our massive network of employees and suppliers through social media. The goal is to leverage the fact that the KFC brand is part of the fabric of China, and of course all of this is on top of the Operation Thunder actions we initiated earlier this year to strengthen our poultry supply chain.","On the marketing calendar front, we\u2019ll be following up the recent new product introduction of our beef burger with promotions featuring chicken on the bone, wings, and beverages. At the same time, our China team will remain very focused on operating efficiency. We were really pleased to see a nearly 20% restaurant margin despite the decline in sales. I want to recognize the team for really busting down at the store level. Pat will share more details on this in his remarks.","In short, I\u2019m confident we\u2019re doing the right things to rebuild consumer trust at KFC China, and we expect to have momentum heading into 2014. The good news is we\u2019ll begin overlapping very weak same-store sales in December, and we\u2019ll have this unfortunate benefit across most of next year.","We\u2019ve planned a number of major menu and value innovations to ignite the sales growth in 2014. Sam Su will share more details of our initiatives during our December meeting in New York.","Now, the obvious question is, why do you think sales momentum has stalled in China? I\u2019ve always said that no two crises are the same, and we\u2019ve always said that we would need the gift of time, and that it would take at least 9 to 12 months. So far, it\u2019s 9 months and counting, and not happening as fast as we would have hoped.","Now, as I just mentioned, trust scores are improving significantly, but still below 2012 levels. We believe this is because KFC\u2019s leadership in size has grown exponentially over the years, and our customers\u2019 expectations of the KFC brand have grown along with it. Social media has also exacerbated the issue, and kept the dialog alive, and macros haven\u2019t helped.","While we\u2019ve announced process improvements, communicated a trust message, and we\u2019ve had value promotions, frankly, we haven\u2019t had the kind of major innovation that could turn the tide. And like I said, we are working hard to get back on track, and we are confident that we will.","On the China development front, we continue to expect at least 700 new units in 2013. This means we will have opened around 1,600 new units in a two-year period, and we expect another strong year of development in 2014, all of which will provide substantial momentum for our China division as sales continue to recover at KFC.","Whether it was Sudan Red, avian flu, or SARS, we experienced temporary setbacks to sales and profits, but we stayed the course and kept building units, and I\u2019m glad we did. KFC is a power brand in China today, and will be for many, many years to come. In fact, even with our recent challenges at KFC, we wouldn\u2019t trade places with anyone else in China.","Today, we have nearly 4,500 KFC restaurants in over 900 cities in China. That\u2019s more than twice the size of our nearest competitor in the QSR category. Additionally, we serve about 60 million customers at KFC every week or so, which is almost the entire population of the U.K. That may be one reason why the BBC recently published a report naming KFC as the number one foreign brand in China.","Any way you look at it, our KFC brand is deeply ingrained in the hearts, minds, and lives of the Chinese customer. Additionally, China is undeniably the number one retail opportunity in the world. The country continues to experience the fastest pace of urbanization the world has ever seen, and the macro trend we remain most enthusiastic about is the growing consuming class, which is expected to increase from 300 million people today to over 600 million people by 2020.","So, with the number one brand in the restaurant category situated in what will soon be the largest consumer economy in the world, and supported by the people capabilities that are the environmentally of our industry, we believe KFC is undoubtedly in a very powerful position to bounce back strongly. Clearly we still have work to do, but we know we\u2019re doing the right things to regain consumer trust, and we remain confident that our best days for KFC in China re yet to come.","Moving to our second brand in China, Pizza Hut casual dining clearly has momentum, delivering solid same-store sales growth in the quarter, up 5% on top of 8% in the third quarter of last year. So far this year, we\u2019ve grown same-store sales at Pizza Hut casual dining by 4% and unit growth of 29%. That\u2019s pretty good performance by any standard.","Pizza Hut casual dining goes well beyond pizza, and is unquestionably the leading western casual dining concept in China. Pizza Hut continues to lead with menu innovation and everyday affordable value. 20% of Pizza Hut\u2019s menu is revamped twice a year, and we recently launched a major new product with stone pan sizzling steak that we know our customers love.","We\u2019re also continuing to leverage our assets by expanding our breakfast menu into more and more cities. With this new sales layer, our long term goal is to create and own the mid-scale casual dining breakfast occasion in China on a scale that matches what exists in the United States today. This is a huge opportunity, and we\u2019re very well-positioned to capture it.","In the third quarter, we opened 38 new Pizza Hut casual dining units, and now have over 950 units in 242 cities, compared to the over 900 cities where KFC currently operates. Importantly, we have a strong economic model, leading to less than three year cash paybacks on new units.","With the terrific performance we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re continuing to accelerate our new unit development and are aggressively expanding into lower-tier cities. We expect to have around 1,000 units by the end of the year, which would be up from about 500 units only three years ago, and we\u2019re just getting started.","We\u2019re also continuing to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service, which is in the home delivery category, has 185 units in 22 cities. We have strong unit economics, driven by best-in-class technology and everyday affordable value, and we\u2019ll ultimately scale this brand across the country.","We\u2019re already a leader in ecommerce with over 60% of our Pizza Hut delivery sales now sourced through online channels, so with the strong foundation already in place, and with the enormous consumer demand for home meal replacement in China that will only grow, we expect our Pizza Hut home service business will contribute more meaningfully in the years ahead.","We also continue to make slow but steady progress with East Dawning, our Chinese fast food concept, but still have work to do before we have a scalable business model. And as I said before on Little Sheep, we\u2019re committed to making this the number one casual dining restaurant chain in China, and showing the true potential of the brand. We\u2019ve had a clear setback, but our belief in what we can ultimately do with this brand remains intact.","So let me wrap up the China business. I\u2019ve always said that our China business will have its ups and downs, and this year is clearly proving to be one of those downs. At the same time, I\u2019ve also said there\u2019s no market we\u2019d rather lead in and invest in.","Make no mistake, we love our overall position in China. We have complete confidence in a full recovery and long term impressive growth at KFC. Pizza Hut casual dining is a growing powerhouse, and we have future growth engines with Pizza Hut home service and ultimately with Little Sheep and East Dawning.","Outside of China, we expect generally on-target performance for Yum! Brands this year, and we\u2019re well-positioned to deliver against our ongoing operating profit targets in 2014 and beyond. At Yum! Restaurants International, 2013 is basically on track.","We have an outstanding business portfolio with nearly 15,000 restaurants in over 120 countries and territories. We have tremendous development opportunities in emerging markets, and over 90% of our restaurants at YRI are franchised. This combination creates a steady stream of franchise fees and strong growth.","Now, as you probably know, Yum! is the clear restaurant leader in emerging markets, and we expect to build upon this position in the years to come. Importantly, the bulk of our emerging market business will continue to be led by franchisees.","The reason our franchisees continue to accelerate development and invest their own capital behind our iconic brands is pretty clear. Payback periods for franchisees in many of these emerging markets are around three years, and we\u2019re attacking our cost structure across the board to improve our overall investment model so that the pace of development will increase over time.","On the subject of international development, I\u2019m pleased to report that we remain on track to open at least 1,000 new units in YRI this year, which is above the 950 units we were expecting at the beginning of the year and represents a new record for the division. Additionally, our development pipeline for new units in 2014 is very robust.","In summary, our international franchise base of about 1,000 franchisees has proven to be a high growth and extremely reliable source, and we expect growth will accelerate over time as more and more of our development occurs in emerging markets, which benefit from faster growing local economies and more favorable cost structures.","Additionally, we expect our relatively new equity base in select emerging markets such as Russia, South Africa, and most recently Turkey, will begin to deliver more profit growth in the future. We initially invested ahead of the growth curve in these markets, but are now positioned to leverage our early investments to achieve higher growth and higher returns in the years to come.","In the United States, we\u2019re having another solid year. With the completion of our refranchising program this year, and the second consecutive year of net new unit growth, we expect to continue consistent 5% profit growth in the years ahead. Taco Bell, which represents about 60% of our U.S. profit, is set up for another solid year.","In recognition of the extraordinary success of the Doritos Locos Tacos and Cantina Bell product platforms introduced in 2012, as well as leading the way with social media along with the launch of the much talked about \u201cLive Mas\u201d advertising campaign earlier this year, Taco Bell was recently named by Advertising Age as Marketer of the Year for the entire consumer goods industry. The brand definitely has mojo, and congratulations to Greg Creed and the team.","Building on this brand strength, we now know we have a winning proposition with our breakfast platform. We have three destination products, great value, and an attractive investment proposition for our franchisees. And the good news is that based upon our extensive market test, 90% of the breakfast sales are incremental, and it looks like the breakfast advertising is also driving total brand sales.","I was in Orlando on Monday for the Taco Bell annual franchise convention, and I was pleased that the franchise leadership stood up on stage and enthusiastically endorsed the national breakfast launch. And it\u2019s clear to me we have a unity of purpose across the entire franchise system to win.","The franchisees are also excited about the significant innovation we have planned for our core business. We know that for the U.S. to have a successful year, it\u2019s important for our most profitable U.S. brand to do well, and we certainly have a lot going in our favor at Taco Bell.","We also expect 2014 to be a better year at Pizza Hut, with the most significant news being our plan to nationally advertise Wing Street for the first time, which includes chicken strips and our award-winning wings. Virtually all the stores in our system are putting in the chicken operating platform so we can use network television next year to feature home delivery chicken products.","The industry-leading pizza innovation, consistent everyday value, and the chicken sales layer will be our focus throughout 2014. We\u2019ve also changed advertising agencies to help us break through more aggressively in the category and leverage the power of our leading brand.","And finally, while the country macros and our recent results haven\u2019t been as strong as we\u2019d like, we\u2019re continuing to invest in and develop a great business in India. We currently have 613 restaurants and we are full steam ahead with development as we expect to open up 150 new units this year. Although it\u2019s still early days, we expect our India division will drive substantial growth for Yum! in years ahead, and we are making the required investments to build a powerhouse there.","So, to sum things up, in spite of our short term sales issue with KFC in China, the fundamentals of the Yum! growth model remain extremely compelling. As you know better than I, there are three keys to driving shareholder value in retail: new unit development, same-store sales growth, and high returns.","In terms of development, our new unit opportunity in emerging markets including China remains the best in retail, and our opportunity to expand is huge. We have three iconic brands, and while we have 58 restaurants per million people in the United States today, we only have two restaurants per million in the emerging markets. That\u2019s a long runway for growth, and gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue our aggressive expansion for many years to come.","Furthermore, we have nearly 40,000 restaurants around the world that have all kinds of capacity to grow. This represents a huge opportunity for same-store sales growth. In addition to our ongoing efforts to drive sales through improved product innovation, marketing, and operations, we\u2019re developing major new sales layers, broadening our menu variety, expanding our day parts, and opening new channels with digital.","I\u2019ve mentioned our breakfast rollouts of Pizza Hut casual dining in China and at Taco Bell, but we\u2019re also doing this at KFC in many of our emerging markets. Pizza Hut Wing Street in the U.S. is another example of what we\u2019re doing to leverage our home delivery capabilities and drive higher levels of asset utilization.","Meanwhile, our returns on invested capital have consistently been among the best in the retail industry. We love the virtually capital free franchise model, which will generate over $1.8 billion in franchise fees this year. These franchise fees provide us with a large, reliable, and growing stream of cash which, combined with the profit from our equity stores, enables us to invest in high-return growth opportunities and return meaningful cash to our shareholders.","Speaking of shareholder cash payouts, I\u2019m pleased to note that we recently increased our dividend by 10%, marking our ninth consecutive annual double digit percentage increase. Since 2004, the year we instituted a dividend payment, we\u2019ve returned over $11 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, all while also continuing to invest in future growth.","The mere fact that we\u2019ve increased our dividend in a down year demonstrates the power of our operating cash flow and the confidence we have that our investment model will deliver strong shareholder returns for many years to come.","In summary, after over a decade of growth, 2013 is clearly proving to be a setback. However, we are confident we will restore our track record of double digit EPS growth in 2014 and well into the future. We have an established track record. In fact, our compound annual growth rate and EPS is above 10% over the past 12 years, and that includes this year.","I want to emphasize that we know these results are yesterday\u2019s news, but we firmly believe that Yum! is a company on the ground floor of global growth, and recognize that it\u2019s \u201cshow me\u201d not \u201ctell me\u201d going forward.","Having said this, we have every belief and enormous intentionality that we\u2019ll begin to get back on track in 2014. We expect to have a strong bounce back year, driving EPS growth of at least 20%, which is admittedly now off a lower base than we had hoped for. And as always, if we can do better, we will.","Now let me hand it over to Pat Grismer, our CFO.","Pat Grismer ","Thank you, David. As David said, 2013 is a very challenging year for Yum! Brands, and our third quarter results were certainly below expectations. I\u2019ll cover the details in a couple of minutes, but I first want to echo David\u2019s view that we don\u2019t consider these results indicative of Yum!\u2019s ongoing performance or future growth potential. We\u2019re confident that our global brands, competitive position, and investment opportunities remain compelling, and we\u2019ll deliver double digit EPS growth for many years to come.","One of the first things I want to do is to explain the timing of our revised guidance for fourth quarter same-store sales growth in China. We had very high expectations for the month of September, with an exciting new product introduction at KFC, the beef burger, and with a much easier comparison from last year. The fact is that we expected a much better result and in hindsight, we were wrong.","When you step back and look at our business this year, there\u2019s no doubt that the unprecedented decline in EPS before special items has been led by the temporary issues at KFC China, with the balance of our portfolio generally meeting full year plan.","Remember, Pizza Hut has continued to deliver outstanding results in China, and our other major divisions, Yum! Restaurants International in the U.S., are generally on track to achieve their full year ongoing growth targets, generating significant cash flow. Importantly, we\u2019ve been able to sustain high rates of investment and have even been able to raise our dividend despite the challenges in China. It takes a company of considerable strength and confidence to do that.","Today, I\u2019ll provide some additional perspective on our third quarter results, our full year outlook, and Yum! shareholder cash payouts. I\u2019ll then share some initial thoughts on 2014.","For the third quarter, we recorded a 15% decline in EPS, before special items, which is obviously disappointing. This decline was led by sales and profit declines in our China division, as well as a higher tax rate. Our third quarter tax rate increased from 25% to 33%, driven primarily by a tax reserve adjustment, which negatively impacted EPS growth by 10% percentage points in the quarter.","This increase relates to the continuing dispute with the IRS regarding a valuation of intangible assets, which has been disclosed in our prior SEC filings. For full year 2013, we now expect our global effective tax rate to be approximately 28%.","Reported EPS declined 67%, primarily due to a noncash special item charge of $258 million to reflect the partial impairment of Little Sheep intangible assets. Partially offsetting this is the noncash $74 million special item gain that we were required to recognize last year upon our acquisition of Little Sheep to write up our previously owned interest to fair value at the time.","As I mentioned on our second quarter earnings call, Little Sheep results were trending below our expectations, due in part to a longer than expected approval process and ownership transition. Our efforts to regain sales momentum were then thwarted by negative publicity surrounding quality issues linked to the hot pot category in China, even though Little Sheep was not involved.","This has further delayed our expansion plans, which were a key component of our initial valuation. Although we remain confident in the long term prospects of the Little Sheep brand, we determined that it was appropriate to write down our investment in the quarter because of the sustained negative sales performance.","Now I\u2019d like to dig a little deeper on each division\u2019s third quarter results. In China, operating profit declined 14% in Q3, prior to foreign currency translation, driven by an 11% decline in same-store sales. This decline in same-store sales included a 14% decline at KFC and 5% growth at Pizza Hut casual dining.","Overall, China division restaurant margin was above 20%, excluding the negative impact of Little Sheep, or 19.5% including Little Sheep. And while restaurant margin declined 1.9 percentage points in the quarter, this is a remarkable achievement when you consider the extent of our same-store sales decline.","It\u2019s clear that our China team has worked very hard to capture restaurant operating efficiencies, delivering sequential improvements in margin performance versus prior year in the last two quarters. As evidence of this, an important restaurant productivity measure that we track, number of transactions per labor hour, was very impressive for the third quarter. And importantly, the team has done this without sacrificing customer service levels.","We\u2019re optimistic that these productivity improvements will sustain as sales continue to recover, and we\u2019ll share more about this at our December meeting in New York.","On the development front, we opened 132 new units in China during the quarter. For the first three quarters, which includes the first eight months of the year, we opened a total of 458 new units in China, or almost 60 units per month. This is in line with our expectations of at least 700 new units in China in 2013.","So to summarize our performance in China, KFC is coming back, although it\u2019s taking longer than we had originally estimated. Pizza Hut casual dining is continuing to have an outstanding year. The team is doing a very good job of managing restaurant margins, and we\u2019re continuing to invest for the future.","At Yum! Restaurants International, operating profit increased 1%, excluding foreign currency translation and the cost of our biannual franchise convention. Including the convention cost, operating profit declined 2% in the quarter. Year to date, operating profit increased 9%.","Importantly, YRI continued to accelerate its pace of development throughout the year, opening 215 new units in the quarter, including 139 units in high-growth emerging markets. YRI same-store sales grew 1% in the quarter. This was softer than we would have liked, as continued weak performance in Japan and our Pizza Hut U.K. business adversely impacted YRI\u2019s strong sales growth by about 2 percentage points.","In emerging markets, even though broad economic growth continued to moderate, we generated strong sales growth of 4% in the quarter. It\u2019s also important to note that YRI\u2019s third quarter strong sales growth was adversely impacted by 1% percentage point due to the timing of Ramadan holidays. This impact will reverse in Q4, delivering a 1 point benefit to YRI\u2019s strong sales growth in the coming quarter.","YRI operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points for the quarter, driven by new unit development and strong sales growth and in spite of a 0.5 percentage point decline in company restaurant margin.","This restaurant margin decrease included the benefit from refranchising our Pizza Hut U.K. dine-in business. Offsetting this benefit was weak margin performance at our KFC U.K. business, which is YRI\u2019s second largest equity market. Restaurant margin was also negatively impacted by underperformance in Turkey.","Moving to the U.S., third quarter operating profit grew 1% versus prior year. Excluding the impact of refranchising, operating profit grew a very respectable 6%. Taco Bell once again led the way in the U.S., delivering strong sales growth of 2% in the quarter, successfully overlapping last year\u2019s growth of 7% and marking the seventh consecutive quarter of positive strong sales growth at Taco Bell. As Taco Bell represents about 60% of the U.S. division\u2019s operating profit, we\u2019re especially pleased to see these sustained results.","For the U.S. division overall, operating margin increased 3.3 percentage points in the quarter, driven by refranchising. This was in spite of a 0.7 percentage point decline in company restaurant margin. U.S. company restaurant margin was 16% for the quarter, and 17% year to date, which we consider healthy.","Now I\u2019m going to talk about our expectations for the full year. As you\u2019d expect, our fourth quarter results remain heavily dependent on our sales recovery at KFC in China. Unfortunately, with disappointing results for the month of September, it\u2019s now unlikely that China division same-store sales will be positive for the fourth quarter, although we do expect to show improvement over the third quarter.","It\u2019s because of this lower than expected sales recovery at KFC China and a higher than expected tax rate that we\u2019re revising our full year EPS forecast to a high single to low double digit percentage decline versus prior year, before special items.","We\u2019ll continue to keep you informed of our progress by temporarily providing monthly updates on China same-store sales until sales have recovered. Our next update will be for the month of October, which we\u2019ll report on November 12, after market hours.","Moving to YRI, we expect another solid year of system sales growth, driven by new unit development of at least 1,000 stores in 2013. This is an increase from the 950 units we were expecting at the beginning of the year, and would represent another new record. This will also be the second consecutive year we\u2019ve achieved 4% unit growth at YRI, giving us strong momentum going forward.","And in the U.S., we\u2019re expecting solid profit growth, driven by continued same-store sales strength at Taco Bell and the second consecutive year of positive net unit growth, led by attractive investment models at both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.","So while our overall results for 2013 will be clouded by the temporary sales issues at our KFC business in China and higher than expected tax rate, the balance of our portfolio remains on track to deliver operating profit growth that is generally in line with our ongoing EPS growth model.","This brings me to my third topic, Yum! shareholder cash payouts. I\u2019m extremely pleased to note that we recently increased our dividend by 10%, marking the ninth consecutive year that we\u2019ve increased our dividend payment at a double digit percentage rate, one of only 10 companies in the S&P 500 to do so. With this rate of growth, we\u2019ve nearly doubled our dividend in the past five years while continuing to return significant cash to share repurchases.","When you consider the impact the temporary KFC China issues have had on this year\u2019s operating cash flow, our dividend increase is yet another reflection of our confidence in future years\u2019 earnings potential. Through the third quarter, we repurchased shares totaling almost $500 million, and we continue to expect over $700 million in repurchases for the year.","Adding it up, we expect to return over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this year, all while continuing to invest over $1 billion behind new store development and other engines of future growth.","As we typically do on our third quarter call, I\u2019ll now share our initial thoughts on 2014. We\u2019re still in the process of developing detailed plans for our businesses next year. In fact, I\u2019ll be traveling with David and Rick as we review each division\u2019s 2014 operating plans over the next few weeks. And as usual, we\u2019ll provide additional perspective at our December meeting in New York.","However, I do want to share some initial thoughts. First, we expect our YRI and U.S. divisions to continue to grow operating profit generally in line with our ongoing growth model, or 10% and 5% respectively.","At YRI, our portfolio has continued to shift to emerging markets, which has delivered consistently strong results. Our international franchise revenue stream has proven to be well-diversified and steadily growing.","We expect this growth will accelerate over time, as an increasing proportion of our new unit development will occur in high growth emerging markets, where unit penetration levels remain very low, where same-store sales growth is fueled by the broad development of booming economies, and where unit level economics are helped by lower cost structures. Record level development at YRI in 2013 will also provide a strong tailwind for earnings growth in 2014.","In the U.S., we expect that another year of net unit growth, coupled with core product innovation and our new breakfast layer at Taco Bell, along with national advertising of Wing Street at Pizza Hut, will support on-target performance next year. We also have some tailwinds on the expense side, primarily related to pension, which will benefit our U.S. business.","Now, on to our China division. As we\u2019ve mentioned, sales are recovering more slowly than we had anticipated, and admittedly have been difficult to call. Because of this, it\u2019s more challenging to estimate next year\u2019s performance compared to previous years.","However, we do expect 2014 to be a bounce-back year for China. Considering the extent of our new unit development over the last two years, the strong momentum we\u2019re seeing with Pizza Hut casual dining, and the restaurant margin improvements we expect will materialize as KFC sales continue to recover, we believe that China division is well positioned to deliver total profit that will at least equal what the division achieved in 2012 or just over $1 billion. Given this year\u2019s significant profit decline in China, that amounts to year over year growth of at least 40% for China division in 2014.","Adding it all up, we expect that 2014 will be a strong bounce-back year for Yum! Brands, and we\u2019re targeting EPS growth of at least 20% next year. We look forward to providing a more detailed perspective on this at our December 4 meeting in New York.","So to wrap things up, we take accountability for this year\u2019s results but view 2013 as a temporary setback, and remain as bullish as ever on our long term growth prospects. As evidence of that, we\u2019re committed to staying the course and investing behind our growth strategies, even in a difficult year.","Given these investments, and the demonstrated growth potential of our businesses, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll bounce back strongly in 2014 and restore our track record of double digit EPS growth in the years to come.","And with that, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And your first question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","Pat, just on your commentary on China and the recovery, what\u2019s the underlying comp assumption that would get you there? In other words, I can see a couple of paths. One, you could say margins are going to improve dramatically, and we expect just moderate comp recovery and then the upside is upside. Or you could say we\u2019re banking on at least double digit comp improvements to get there. So how do you frame how you think you\u2019re going to get to that 40% profit improvement in China, comps versus margin?","Pat Grismer ","At this stage of the process, we wouldn\u2019t provide a roadmap like that as to how we expect to realize growth. The fact is that there are many different ways we can get to that number. In the current context, given where we\u2019re at with our sales recovery, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re very balanced in our sales expectations for next year and we\u2019re focusing on continuing to realize the productivity improvements that have given us the nice lift to margins this year.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","Can you describe the sales productivity in a little bit more detail in China? It\u2019s been phenomenal. We look at it on a per-store basis. You\u2019re looking at it on transactions per labor hour. But are there any one-time elements to it in this quarter that may not recur? And maybe when you think about transactions coming back, have you permanently reduced the labor hours per transaction, or transactions per labor hour, so you don\u2019t have to add that incremental labor back?","Pat Grismer ","Well, as you can imagine, there are a number of things that we\u2019re doing to drive restaurant level productivity. The fact is that the team is learning to operate very efficiently under unprecedented conditions. Bear in mind this is the third consecutive quarter of same-store sales decline, and when you think about that, we\u2019re very pleased with the team\u2019s focus to drive profitability.","One of the ways that they\u2019ve been able to be more efficient is that they\u2019ve improved the way that they\u2019ve forecasted sales in their labor requirements at the store level. They\u2019ve become increasingly sophisticated in this area, and they\u2019re developing new tools and techniques to deliver optimal service levels with relatively low labor. So we remain confident they\u2019re going to be able to sustain these results into next year. And on top of that, they\u2019re continuing to work through new ways of [inaudible] productivity.","The other thing I want to point out is that clearly we\u2019re very pleased with our performance, with China restaurant margin, in the third quarter. But I do want to set the right expectations for Q4, because there are some things that are a bit different in Q4 compared to Q3.","The first is that we\u2019re going to lose 1 point of margin benefit from rollover pricing when you compare Q4 to Q3. The other is that [AMP] [ph] will be a full point higher. That\u2019s our advertising spending. A full point higher versus last year, whereas in Q3 we\u2019re relatively flat versus prior year. And we do expect there to be some moderate amount of food inflation, whereas commodities were flat in the third quarter.","So you add up these three things, and that\u2019s about 3 points of margin headwind in the fourth quarter that we didn\u2019t have in Q3. However, we do expect that same-store sales and same-store transactions will be better in Q4 than in Q3, and that will help to mitigate those impacts. So when we look at the full year for China margin, we\u2019re 16% year to date through Q3. Given that we\u2019re moving into a lower seasonality period, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that we\u2019ll be in the mid-teens on a full year basis.","I think it is important just to understand what the near term outlook is for China margins. But I also want to reinforce that we couldn\u2019t be happier with the effort of the China team to drive productivity at the store level, and we expect those efforts will sustain into 2014.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","Just one broad question, which is how convinced are you that you know the answer to why sales declines in China have been related specifically to the incidents you talked about? November last year you saw some sales declines. It\u2019s never really been fully addressed, at least in my mind, that those are occurring prior to this. And as we\u2019ve gotten further away from these incidents, things haven\u2019t gotten better. They\u2019ve gotten stable, maybe worse, on a month over month basis. So what evidence do you have to offer that says it\u2019s not cannibalization, it wasn\u2019t pricing, it\u2019s not competition, and that you\u2019re convinced that it\u2019s just the supplier and avian flu issue that just lingers?","David Novak","I think the biggest evidence we have, John, is just the fact that our overall trust and reliability and safety measures are below what they were the previous year. And we think we really need to get those back at least level, and build from that point.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ","Just a follow up on that last question, David. I think there were some metrics shared at the China investor day that showed that the brand reliability scores had improved very dramatically from earlier in the year and are almost at levels that you saw in 2012. Yet the sales recovery seems to be lagging, the recovery in the brand scores. So just wondering how you reconcile those, and do you normally see the brand reliability scores as more of a leading indicator, or a coincident indicator when you\u2019re looking at your sales trends?","David Novak ","You know, we really haven\u2019t looked at it as reliability scores or trust as leading indicators. I think what we always look at is what perceptions [inaudible] do we have to change, build, or reinforce to grow the business? And what we see is that the biggest issues we have from a perception standpoint lie in the area of the safety, reliability, trust. And so I think that\u2019s what we see as the biggest problem we have. The trend is moving in the right direction, we\u2019re just not all the way back, and I think what we have to do is get all the way back.","And also, I think what we think we need is we need more innovation. We need more innovation. We\u2019ve done I think a very good job on the value front, but frankly we haven\u2019t really presented the concept as innovatively as I think we\u2019re going to need to to really take the business to the next level. And Sam Su and the team are working very hard on that, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have something that we can be much more excited about next year.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ","I know you had talked about, in the past, kind of time will heal, the recovery process I guess. And I\u2019m wondering if your thinking has changed on that at all, and whether you think you might need to invest some of the productivity savings you have, maybe in a more aggressive marketing approach to get the sales moving.","David Novak ","I think we have plenty of marketing to spend. And we have a leadership position, which gives us leadership advertising budget. And so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a real issue for us as we go forward. I always tell our people it depends on what we\u2019re talking about, okay? And I think what we have to do now is we\u2019ve got this \u201cI Commit\u201d campaign to really drive home the reliability and trust issues.","But as we move into 2014 next year, we think we\u2019ve got a tremendous brand that we can glorify, magnify the role that we have in people\u2019s lives, take the offense by being extremely positive, to bring forward the kind of news that we think will excite our customers more. And that\u2019s what the team\u2019s been working on.","And to me, it\u2019s taken us longer than what we\u2019d hoped, but we always said that we would need time, and I think we still need the gift of time. But I think historically, if you look back at our brand, or at any other powerful brand, they come back. And we\u2019re going to come back.","Rick Carucci ","As an example of that, if you go back a couple of years, and look at Taco Bell, we had issues there a while back that were really fake consumer issues on a bogus lawsuit. And some news that would have normally propelled the brand forward, right after that, really didn\u2019t do it. And some time has to pass. You\u2019ve got a little bit of momentum, and then when we really hit new products like Cantina Bell and Doritos Locos Tacos is when the brand really took off. And now we\u2019ve been able to sustain that performance as David said for now seven quarters. So I think we need something similar to that progression in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan ","First, Pat, you kind of gave a lot of different moving pieces for the margin in the quarter. Would you mind spoon feeding us exactly what you\u2019re trying to communicate, not just necessarily for the full year, but the fourth quarter, whether it\u2019s just like a data point or like a range, just to make sure we\u2019re all in the right place?","Pat Grismer ","We typically don\u2019t provide margin guidance on the quarter. What I wanted to do, though, was indicate that Q4 will look different from Q3, because there are those moving pieces that I outlined. But we do expect the productivity benefits to sustain, and we expect the impact from sales to be less in Q4 than we experienced in Q3. So the full year number, as I mentioned, is in that mid-teen range, which is pretty consistent with where we\u2019re at year to date, through the end of Q3.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan ","And then secondly, it happens a lot, not necessarily with you guys, that a focus on cost actually becomes a circular reference, and actually influences transaction sales, ability to serve the customer, especially during peak day parts. So could you just kind of talk about this focus on labor in the third quarter, that just happened to correspond with sales being weaker than you thought in the third quarter, just to make sure those two are not related in some way?","Pat Grismer ","There\u2019s absolutely no relationship between those two things. We consider our best operators in the world to be in China, and as you would expect, they remain very much focused on customer service metrics, and they do not do things with their labor scheduling that would in any way compromise the customer experience. We don\u2019t see that as at all related to sales performance.","David Novak ","I think if there\u2019s one characteristic that I would give the Chinese team the most kudos for, if we have one group that thinks more long term, or more long term than them, I don\u2019t know what group it is. We do things on behalf of the customer, we think about the brand for the long term. We went into this year knowing we were going to have a difficult year. Our direction to the China team was do the right thing, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan ","And the final question from me, if I may, is on occupancy costs, especially as rent renewals and other things come up in the market. How much of a negative, if it is one, is occupancy cost potentially to the model over the next couple of years? How big of a headwind could it be? Or might there be other offsets to keep that line in check?","David Novak ","We don\u2019t see anything really changing going forward from what we\u2019ve seen in the past. We do see some rent increases, particularly in tier one cities, that have been larger, but fortunately for us we\u2019re a country-wide business with lower rental costs in lower tier cities, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re skewing our development. So we don\u2019t see that as moving significantly going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein ","I just have a couple of follow up questions. One on China. I wanted to ask, are you still seeing wide gaps in performance between the lower tier and the higher tier cities with respect to comp? And the reason I ask is sometimes when you look at businesses in this industry, that\u2019s one of the kind of harbingers of maybe a need to slow growth, is what you\u2019re seeing in new units or performance. And I know in lower tier cities, new unit productivity and performance has been very good, but especially now, with the pressure on your top line, does that gap persist? And is there a signal there that maybe you do need to slow at least KFC unit growth in China? And then I had a follow up question on YRI.","Pat Grismer ","With respect to same-store sales growth, city [tiers], unlike the first half of the year, what we saw in Q3 was pretty comparable to performance across the cities. So you\u2019ll remember that the Shanghai region and other large cities were more severely impacted in the first quarter, and then avian flu cases being concentrated in Shanghai in the second quarter, we saw that disparity between city tiers. But that has not persisted into the third quarter.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein ","And then in terms of the unit growth, is there any kind of signal here that maybe that needs to slow, given that presumably new unit volumes have come down along with the rest of the system?","Pat Grismer","No, not at this stage. We remain committed to opening at least 700 new units this year. We\u2019re not providing detailed guidance on next year at this stage, but I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s hard to imagine that we would open fewer units in 2014 than we opened in 2013. As you know, we have world-class real estate development capability in China. We\u2019re very disciplined in the way that we make those new unit decisions, and those openings are decided one at a time.","The one thing we\u2019re doing, consistent with what we articulated in December, is that we are shifting our development focus. So yes, we are shifting more over to Pizza Hut casual dining from KFC, and within KFC, we\u2019re shifting from the tier one, tier two coastal cities to tier three and below cities. And we\u2019re seeing that with the development activity even in Q3 versus prior years.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein ","And then if I may, on YRI, you talked about investing ahead of growth, but expecting to see emerging markets really drive performance. You\u2019ve talked about how India, maybe the macro wasn\u2019t as good as you expect, but you\u2019re not generating a lot of profit there. I think Turkey was mentioned as one where maybe the environment hasn\u2019t been as good. Can you just talk a little bit in broad strokes about when emerging markets, upside of China, really will start to drive performance? Do you need to refranchise the rest of the U.K. before we can see that? Or just is this kind of a one or two year, or is this more like a five plus year timeline?","Rick Carucci ","I think if you look at the emerging markets, clearly the bulk of that business, again, is a franchise business. And overall, the economies in emerging markets are slowed a little bit from what they were a year ago, but are still pretty healthy. And you see that in the results we posted in the third quarter, where we saw system sales growth of 11%.","If you look at the profitability we get from the equity markets, it will build over time. And most of those markets, the Russias, South Africas, and Turkeys as examples, they\u2019re still sub-scale businesses from an equity standpoint. However, even I think in 2014, I\u2019d expect us to make more money in those markets collectively than we did in 2013. So I\u2019d expect that to be a little bit of a benefit in 2014 and that becoming an increasing benefit over time.","Pat Grismer ","What I would add to Rick\u2019s comments is that we\u2019re continuing to invest aggressively behind our equity positions in emerging markets, because we love the unit-level economics that we see there, what we call home-run economics. We know that there\u2019s enormous growth potential, and we believe that it\u2019s important to maintain a leadership position to lead the system, if you will, to capture the potential.","With respect to to your question around KFC U.K., we have always had a very strong, disciplined, earn the right to own mentality. We are always evaluating our ownership positions and making adjustments as we go. It\u2019s not necessary that we reduce our ownership position there before we move more aggressively with our equity investment in emerging markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - CLSA ","I wanted to ask you about your commentary about new store openings next year. And I appreciate you\u2019re not giving details on that, but in an environment where you expect to open at least as many next year as you did this year, do you think the supply chain in China is ready for that? Here I\u2019m really concerned about the poultry industry and your ability to secure safe supply. I know you cut a thousand producers from your supply chain this year, but could you talk about that? Is the supply chain ready in China for this continued ramp of new store openings?","Pat Grismer ","We are optimistic that the supply chain is there. We have developed very strong relationships with the large poultry suppliers in China, as we\u2019ve, over the last year, tightened our quality assurance protocols. And based on the fact that we\u2019re looking at a year when volumes are significantly down versus last year, there is capacity in the system today, and our poultry suppliers are partners with us to plan for the growth in the category. So we are confident that that capacity exists.","Diane Geissler - CLSA ","And you said you were shifting more toward Pizza Hut and more toward KFC in lower tiers. Is there a way to think about maybe the number of KFCs versus the number of Pizza Huts, if you\u2019re opening 700 units on an annual basis?","Pat Grismer ","Well, just to give you a sense for how we are shifting, I\u2019ll just give you a couple of data points and maybe that will give you some indication of the types of changes we\u2019re making in the shape of our development program. When you look at the units we\u2019ve opened year to date in China, 31% of those were Pizza Hut casual dining. Last year, it was 24%. So there\u2019s a clear shift toward Pizza Hut casual dining, given the very strong unit level economics we see, the very compelling investment proposition.","Another data point is with our KFC brands. Year to date, this year, 13% of our new unit openings were in tier one cities. Last year, that number was 19%. So again, this is what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re shifting our development activity, we\u2019re shifting our capital investment towards the opportunities that offer the stronger returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs ","I guess first, I just want to ask you to talk about food inflation in China starting to show up again. How much of that is from the increased cost of an evolving supply chain in China versus pure food inflation? And the reason I ask is because China food PPI is very muted right now, while you\u2019re talking about inflation.","Pat Grismer ","Yeah, we don\u2019t see the changes to our supply chain having a perceptible impact to food cost. And as I talked about, the food cost inflation changing from what we saw in Q3, it\u2019s a moderate change. We saw basically flat commodity costs in Q3, and we expect modestly positive in Q4. It\u2019s not a dramatic swing. And it\u2019s unrelated to the changes we\u2019ve made to our supply chain.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs ","And then could you maybe elaborate more on the payroll expenses in China, and how we should think about separating out what might be a new re-based lower level of expenses with efficiencies you\u2019ve found, versus what\u2019s going to need to bounce back in \u201914 when sales presumably return?","Pat Grismer ","There\u2019s no doubt that labor inflation has been much lower in China that we had anticipated. You\u2019ll recall that we had guided mid-teens labor inflation, and what we now expect for 2013 is high single digits. Now, that has come through a favorable mix shift in our restaurant level employees, and some restaurant level wage control.","But I do want to stress that we don\u2019t necessarily see that continuing into next year. The fact is that wage growth had moderated across China, but the central government\u2019s objective remains to double disposable per capita income by 2020. And as you know, that ultimately works to our advantage from the standpoint of growing our customer base. And it\u2019s really on that basis that we are expecting China labor inflation in 2014 to move back to what we\u2019ve traditionally guided, which is that low to mid double digit range.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","I\u2019m curious on the sales issue if you have a sense of what the industry in China is doing. And I guess the direction of my question is how much of this is macro-related versus tied to the chicken issues?","David Novak ","I don\u2019t think we have any new category information to share. I think that first of all the macros, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s really healthy. But when we look at the Pizza Hut business, Pizza Hut, because it\u2019s had the innovation, because it\u2019s had the value, because it\u2019s had the operational excellence, it\u2019s performing well. So we think that regardless of what\u2019s going on in the category, or with competition or whatever, with the strength of our brands, when we get things right we can move the needle.","And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on at KFC. We\u2019re working on keeping Pizza Hut right, and we\u2019re excited about everything we\u2019re doing there on the innovation front, expanding breakfast, and then we\u2019re working on revamping KFC to come at the market in a fresher perspective.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","So the slower than expected recovery really is around the trust issues and sort of KFC brand perception issues as opposed to\u2026","David Novak ","If you look at the consumer research, that\u2019s what our take is. This is not a precise science, you know? I can\u2019t tell you 100% for sure, but when we look at what do we have to target at KFC, what do we need to do at KFC to really get the business moving forward, we think it\u2019s continuing to make progress on regaining the trust. We have made steady progress, we\u2019re getting closer to where we want to be from an overall research standpoint, but we\u2019re still behind.","We like to do problem detection studies, and the food safety and trust issue remains our biggest problem that we need to deal with. And what I ask all of our divisions to do, wherever I go around the world, we want to know what perceptions [unintelligible] do we have to change, build, or reinforce to grow the business? And we think that the perception that we had to change at KFC, and enhance, and get it back to where it was, is the whole reliability and trust issue.","But we\u2019re not going to do that forever, okay? We\u2019ve got this \u201cI Commit\u201d campaign, we\u2019re going to get the message out there, and then it\u2019s time to move on. It\u2019s time to move on and tell people what we\u2019ve got, and get people excited about our brands, and that\u2019s my message to the China team. We\u2019re going to deal with this, stay after it, keep building trust, do everything we can to earn that trust back, but we really think that we need to excite our customers with more innovation and more excitement about the brand. And that\u2019s the real marketing focus for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.","Andy Barish - Jefferies ","Just one other expense question on China. Can you help me understand kind of the occupancy variable versus fixed, just on broad brushstrokes? And then one other question on the U.S. after that.","Steve Schmitt","Just on the occupancy cost line, as you know we do have variable rents, which is unique to the China business in our system. And we have a variable component, in actually more than half of our leases in China. So that is a variable component that\u2019s unique to China. And now in the quarter we did have, as you might imagine, the restaurants are looking at ways to control costs. So from a semi-variable standpoint, the teams are definitely doing what they can to guard profits in this environment, without impacting services.","Andy Barish - Jefferies ","And on U.S. restaurant level margins, you pointed to inflation as well picking up a little bit. Where do you see that in the third quarter in the U.S. business?","Patrick Grismer","Generally very moderate. For the U.S. it\u2019s relatively flat for the year on a commodity standpoint, and labor is in the low single digits.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank ","Just one more on China. Looking back at the September number that you guys talked about kind of surprised you, can you talk a little bit more about what happened there? We don\u2019t actually have the monthlies from last year, so I don\u2019t know what the comparison was, in August versus September maybe. That would be helpful. And then was it just a promotional misfire that was a big issue in the month? Or were there other specific one-offs that maybe caused the weakness in September?","Patrick Grismer ","As I mentioned we had very high expectations for the month of September, not only because of the launch of this new product, but because we were lapping [unintelligible] performance in September versus August. And I\u2019m not going to get into the extent of that difference, but we were anticipating that that was going to provide a lift to the month. And frankly, we weren\u2019t going to call the month and the quarter, bearing in mind that September is the first month of China division\u2019s fourth quarter, until we had read the full month. It was a big disappointment to us, to such an extent that we revised our guidance for Q4 same-store sales.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank ","But can you talk a little bit about what was disappointing about it other than just sales were under plan?","David Novak ","Well, we launched the beef burger, which is a product innovation that we had some high hopes for. And while we had good success rate in the sense that the mix was good, we didn\u2019t get the incrementality, which we think also gives us the belief that we\u2019ve got to keep working on the trust side of the equation. So that\u2019s basically what we had in September.","I think that we always will call it like we see it, when we see it. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. We definitely missed on the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s just the way it is. I wish we had a 1000% batting average. It\u2019s a hell of a lot more fun to have these calls when you do, I can tell you that. But we missed, okay?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research ","Just following up on a comment that you made about the comps in tier one, tier two cities versus tier three to tier six, how it seems like they\u2019re now comparable on the weakness versus earlier in the year where it seemed like the larger cities, which had more of the food safety issues, had weaker comps. That seems interesting to me. Can you maybe try to explain that? Why would the tier three to tier six cities start to soften? Is it the perception of the chicken supply moving to that area? Is it the macros, competition? Because that seems to be the stronghold, the lower-tier cities, and now that seems to be more emulating the tier one, tier two cities.","Pat Grismer ","That\u2019s actually not the right way to think about it. What happened was that the tier one, tier two cities were more significantly impacted in Q1 and Q2. All city tiers have shown significant improvement in Q3 versus the first half of the year, but there were significantly greater improvement in the higher tier cities off of their very low position in the first half of the year. So all of them are getting better, it\u2019s just that given how very weak, by comparison to what the tier one, tier two cities were, that we\u2019re now seeing that they\u2019re all more or less coalescing around the same [expensive] same-store sales climate in the third quarter. It\u2019s not that the lower tier cities are now getting worse, or that they\u2019re underperforming the tier one.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research ","Then maybe could you explain why the tier three, tier six cities are in line with the tier one, tier two cities? You have just a lot less competition. It does seem like the food safety issues were more concentrated in the tier one, tier two cities. It just seems like tier three to tier six is where the strength has been, and it seems like it\u2019s more in line with the overall system, even though you\u2019re much less saturated. And if the economy is the issue, that\u2019s fine. It just seems like you\u2019re playing down the macros, and it\u2019s more company specific and food safety related issues.","David Novak ","We never have blamed the macros for anything. We don\u2019t talk about macros, or weather, or anything like that. We just don\u2019t. We just don\u2019t believe in it. If I start, and I hear myself say that, I think everybody\u2019s kind of going to look at me funny. So that\u2019s one thing.","I think what we really have here is a country wide issue of trust. And it\u2019s in tier four, five, six cities, tiers one, two, three cities. That\u2019s what we really think we have to address. That\u2019s what our marketing folks have determined by listening to our customers, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting after. So I think that\u2019s the issue that we\u2019re really trying to deal with.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research ","If I could just slip in another question on the U.S. business, with Taco Bell gearing up for breakfast going national in 2014, any sense of the time table? Should we expect that beginning of the year, mid year? And maybe the same with Pizza Hut and Wing Street. When should we expect these national initiatives?","Rick Carucci ","Breakfast, we don\u2019t know the exact timing, but I\u2019d say roughly middle of the year next year. On Wing Street, we expect that to start at the beginning of the year.","David Novak ","Breakfast will be in the first half of the year for Taco Bell. We\u2019re working on the details. It\u2019s a competitive category.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ","Two questions. The first one is a follow up on China. Having been there, I guess a month ago, there seems to be some confidence perhaps in pricing power in \u201914 to offset labor costs, which it sounds like are going to be double digits. Food might be a lot more modest, but that there would be pricing power to insulate or drive the margin. And you said you\u2019re lapping one point of price going into the fourth quarter. So can you give us an update on where we are now in pricing, and perhaps qualitatively how do you assess pricing power, whether you might be more cautious now and therefore we shouldn\u2019t expect any kind of meaningful price increase next year, how you think about that?","Pat Grismer ","Our expectation is that we will take pricing to offset inflation. Naturally, given current circumstances of the KFC brand, we\u2019re very sensitive to how consumers perceive our value. But we believe that we can do both. We can offer strong value and we can take the amount of pricing necessary to offset inflation. Because we are very much focused on the profitability of our restaurants.","We believe it\u2019s critical to achieve the new unit returns that are essential to accelerating the pace of development over time. When we meet in December, we can share with you some more insights into how we might be looking at pricing for next year, but I would say generally speaking, going forward, it would be to offset inflation.  ","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ","But the pricing for the fourth quarter, should we expect that to be relatively flat for full year?","Pat Grismer","No, no new pricing actions. We\u2019ll have about a point of benefit or so. And that\u2019s strictly from rollover actions.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ","And the follow up question is just on that U.S. segment. With three big brands, you\u2019re a great proxy for broader U.S. QSR. You addressed that inflation was relatively modest, but in the press release you also talk about promotional activities perhaps pressuring margins. I\u2019m just wondering, on the promotional activity, is that more your own promotional activity, in which case what might it have been that would have pressured margin, or perhaps any kind of color on broader QSR, where you might be seeing some outsized pressure? Just wondering if maybe the competition is getting more or less rational with more modest food costs and a challenging traffic environment?","Rick Carucci ","The short answer is I don\u2019t think that Q3 is a trend or something that\u2019s different than what\u2019s been occurring in the category. The category the last month has been pretty flat in the U.S., so it is a competitive category and there\u2019s not a lot of total growth out there. I would say that always in our category value is key, and we\u2019re always playing it at the key brand. If you look at it on a year to date basis, we\u2019re obviously very happy with the overall margins, and there\u2019s nothing out there from a promotional standpoint that I think is going to dramatically change those margins in any way. I think it was almost just the timing of what we were running in Q3 this year versus Q3 last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk Management.","Howard Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management ","I have two questions. My first one is about the asset light model. You\u2019ve bought two assets in the last year. You bought the assets in China, and then you bought Turkey, which kind of moves you away from the asset light model. And I understand that the returns are high in the emerging markets, but the returns are even greater in an asset light model. Is there a slight shift away from the asset light model, with your acquiring Little Sheep in Turkey in particular?","Pat Grismer ","Not at all. We believe that one of the strengths of our business is that we are as heavily franchised as we are, which drives extraordinary return on invested capital for us. So we\u2019re not moving away from that strategy. What we are doing is we\u2019re shifting where we place our equity. So don\u2019t forget that we\u2019ve done some significant refranchisings in recent years, and we\u2019ve taken that capital and we\u2019ve put it into the high-growth emerging markets where we know we can get much stronger returns.","Howard Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management ","And then the second question is you alluded to, David, in the beginning, that each crisis is different. And Taco Bell\u2019s recovery in the United States was not an easy one, but you didn\u2019t have the capacity increases in the store base that you had, so you were just fixing existing assets.","And in China, each situation is different, or each crisis has been different, and each year you\u2019re facing increased capacity as you\u2019re adding 700 stores this year. So you\u2019re trying to turn around a base when your capacity is increasing significantly, and I know you were asked about the growth rate in China, but I was hoping you could maybe reiterate your confidence in the growth rate in China and that you\u2019re actually seeing the returns in the tier one cities.","You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, but is 13% the right number of what your unit growth should be in those tier one cities? So there\u2019s a lot of questions around sort of development and growth, and I would just, I guess, like to hear you, again, say with confidence that your growth rate is appropriate, and that we\u2019re not going to be hearing in December or six months or 12 months from now that you\u2019re going to be slowing it down.","David Novak ","Well, I think the exact growth rate we\u2019ll need to get back to you on, and we\u2019ll be able to talk, I think, more about that in December. We\u2019re always evaluating our growth rate. We have our new unit tracking model, and making adjustments where we need to make adjustments. And Pat\u2019s already talked about many of those. I think when we look at China, we think the big macro that is a positive is the 300 million, the 600 million consuming class.","And so when you look at the long term, and what we think we can do in China, I think that nothing has really changed. We\u2019re going to grow at the right rate to take advantage of the fact that we have the leading position in the dominant consumer market in the world, soon to be the fastest growing economy. So that\u2019s really our strategy. We\u2019ll only grow as fast as our people allow us to do it, and our returns justify it.","And as we look to next year, we see opening up at least 700 more restaurants next year. And we think that the investments we\u2019re making in our restaurants, and restaurant development, will pay off for us as we go forward. Because we still only have a thousand Pizza Huts and 4,500 KFCs, in a business where we think you could take it times four or five. So we\u2019ll get there the right way. That\u2019s what I would tell our shareholders.","Howard Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management ","I understand that you have a huge opportunity in China, and it\u2019s a 10-year, 20-year, 30-year opportunity, but it\u2019s the return on the incremental capital that you\u2019re putting in the ground. And how do we know that 700 is the right number, and it shouldn\u2019t be 500, or maybe it should be 900? And I guess I\u2019m spinning my wheels here, but I just want to push a little bit harder on the rate of growth versus the absolute opportunity.","Pat Grismer ","Well, as I mentioned before, we make these investment decisions one at a time. And we bring to bear unparalleled expertise and intelligence around retail development in China. We\u2019re not chasing a number per se. We\u2019re capturing an opportunity where we know we can create a lot of value for our shareholders.","Operator","And your final question comes from Paul Westra with Stifel.","Paul Westra - Stifel","One more time on China. I was wondering if you could share any further insights into the dispersion of the recovery in the comps beyond the tiers one and two versus three and six. In other words, is there any day part that has maybe rebounded almost fully now, that maybe gives you confidence, or maybe you expected business lunch to recover and maybe the family dinner weekends has not. Or is there anything that has any consumer, any location, any day part, mix that you can see that maybe gives you some green shoots that the leading occasion has recovered and the lagging occasion that you expected is going to take more time?","Pat Grismer ","No real meaningful variances across the city tiers by day part, or any other occasion. Pretty consistent, pretty balanced across the market.","Paul Westra - Stifel ","And is that what happened in other comparable crises? Is that what you expected?","Pat Grismer ","Well, as I mentioned, the picture was very different in Q1 and Q2, because there were structural differences, if you will, between what was happening relative to social media, news stories, and so forth. So that\u2019s why the tier one cities were more heavily impacted in the first half of the year. But as we mentioned earlier, what we now have is more of a country wide issue, if you will, pretty much a level playing field in that regard. And so we\u2019re not seeing meaningful differences across the city tiers.","Paul Westra - Stifel ","And on weekend versus weekday business?","Pat Grismer ","No.","David Novak ","Okay, let me wrap this up. First of all, thank you for being on the call. We appreciate it. Obviously we\u2019re disappointed with our overall third quarter results, but I\u2019d just like to close by saying that we will be back, and we think 2014 will be a strong bounce back year, and we remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver sustainable and strong growth in the years to come. So thanks again."," "],"22812":["Yum! Brands, Inc.

Fourth quarter earnings will be released on February 8, 2018 with the conference call on the same day as we plan to provide perspective on 2018 in conjunction with that call.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed ","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Yum! Brands delivered another strong quarter of results with 11% co-operating profit growth and 22% EPS excluding special items. System sales grew 6% driven by 3% same store sales growth and 3% net unit growth. ","We're reiterating our guidance of 207 and remain firmly on track with achieving our 2019 transformation goals.","Today I want to first talk you about our recent anniversary celebrations, then I will discuss two of our four key growth drivers, which influenced our daily decision making including unrivalled culture and talent and distinctive relevant easy brands. And then David will follow up with both restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. ","Now to begin our recent anniversary celebrations. Two days ago, we celebrated our anniversary since the spinoff of Yum China as independent company and David and will fortunate to up to be in the China last week to celebrate and talk about our future together.","We're proud of the Yum China success and impressed by their ability to make Yum, Yum's brand distinctive relevant and easy. Our collaboration with Yum China is strong as ever and we\u2019re confident in the power of our brands by working together. In connection with the spinoff we announced our multiyear strategic transformational initiatives to become more focused, more franchise and more efficient so we can deliver more growth to our shareholders. We're making significant strides towards completion of these initiatives and look forward to updating you today and as we progress on this journey. ","Another reason anniversary occurred last month when we celebrated our 20th anniversary as an independent company, since the October 1997 spinoff from PepsiCo Yum brands has more than doubled its system sales, growing operating profit more than six times over and developed into a global power house, selling from 30% of restaurant outside the U.S. to nearly 60% of restaurants outside the U.S. A $10,000 investment in Yum brands in 1997 at the time of spin-off from PepsiCo would be worth $170,000 today, a phenomenal return. ","A lot of change has occurred in 20 years and really even in the last year but the one constant has been our unrivalled culture and talents. When David Novak began leaving this company, he truly believe that culture mattered and it could be a distinct competitive advantage. And I'm proud to say to our people first culture has never been stronger and is a competitive advantage for Yum. ","As I traveled to some of the 137 countries where Yum is represented, I'm able to witness the first hand the caliber of our people around the world. I take a lot of pride in knowing that our people first culture drives the passion for our brands that each of our employees and partners display. As they are truly engaged in delivering their unit piece of Yum. As we celebrate these first and 28th anniversary, I'm committed to ensuring that our under rival culture and talent remains an advantage for Yum today and I the future. ","Now to our three distinctive, relevant and easy brands. First KFC representing nearly 50% of the operating profit. During the quarter system sales grew 7% with 4% same store sales growth and 4% net unit growth. At our recent analyst day, we highlighted the brand, strong track record of success and the significant room for growth in both developed and emerging markets. We also highlighted delivery as a future, driver of future results we're we expected double delivery sales to at least 2 billion by 2020. KFC product is ideal for delivery and market share an enthusiasm for executing it. That\u2019s why our KFC teams attended the delivery summit where Yum! China shared key learnings from their extensive delivery network including best practices to ensure this becomes a successful repeatable model for KFC around the globe. ","The need to ease is making delivery the largest growth drivers for KFC and the team came home with several actions items to not only accelerate the growth of the delivery business at KFC but to make sure the experience is best-in-class.","As another example of best practice sharing, approximately 300 KFC individuals from around the world including franchises, came together to share ideas on value, delivery and innovation at our annual marketing planning meeting this quarter. ","That the teams came hungry to learn from their counterparts across the globe as the types of 12 food innovations and left the meeting confident that KFC has a very strong global pipeline of innovation routed in insights and culture. Taking place for over a decade now this is the original repeatable model. ","As I mentioned earlier the entire global leadership team and I've been as weak in China where we all came away impress with the China team's ability to make our brands distinctive relevant and easy. And KFC China is executing on digital, social and delivery. ","We even had KFC delivered to us on the train by placing our orders via mobile, with the team member delivering it to us at the next stop when we arrived. It really doesn\u2019t get much easier than that. Yum! China has truly traded in all access brand. In vision to China, another market demonstrating their power distinctive relevant and easy brands is Latin America, our year-to-date same-store sales growth has grown 5% and third quarter same-store sales growth 4%. ","Using our always original brands positioning, the team has grown the call with buckets and box meals as well as driven innovations through the launch of flavored chicken on the bone and our marriage of chicken and pizza into the Chikzaa. ","Thailand has turned around their business this quarter with 4% same-store sales growth by adding more value to the calendar and communicating in a way that really connects with consumers. As an example, the chicken and share for TBH99 or approximately $3 offers value in the snacking category and is positioned as TBH20 or $0.60 per person. KFC is truly a global powerhouse brand with China, Latin America and Thailand being the three examples of our markets demonstrating success with our always original brand positioning, value and delivery. ","Next the Pizza Hut, currently representing 20% of Yum!'s annual operating profit split nearly even between the U.S. and international. During the quarter Pizza Hut U.S. system sales declined 1% with flat same-store sales growth and 2% net unit decline. ","At our recent Analyst Day, we demonstrated the changes underway as a result of the transformation agreement signed in the U.S. at beginning of May. Mainly a hot, fast and reliable Pizza Hut experience. Most importantly, the transformation agreement represents clear alignment amongst the system for a digital delivery centric way forward. ","We are making our investment in hot in a 360-degree way. When you see our ads on TV they highlight our commitment to delivering our Pizza 15 degrees hotter. When the pizza arrived at your house it's wrap in a new delivery [couch] with three layers of thermal installation. When you bite into the pizza it will be crispier as a result of our new proprietary sheet included inside every box. Each of these changes are designed to deliver on our commitment to hot. These changes were rolled out to all Pizza Huts across the U.S. just after the end of the third quarter and will be part of your next Pizza Hut experience. ","To deliver on our fast and reliable commitment, Pizza Hut announced the addition of 14,000 new delivery drivers by the end of the year and has executed other operational enhancements design to make the delivery system more efficient. Additionally, the Hut Rewards Loyalty Program was launched in August, we're encouraged by initial trends and are confident our investment in loyalty will pay off in the long run. ","As we said before we do not expect the transformation agreement to yield results over night but we do expect to see improvement over time. I'm confident that the changes made with the transformation agreement will allows us to execute on our commitment to a hot, fast and reliable Pizza Hut experience over the long-term. ","Internationally Pizza Hut system sales grew 7% with same store sales worth of 2% and net unit growth of 6%. At the analyst day we highlighted the growth potential of this business through unit growth and repeatable models including technology ventures. ","India was a standout market for Pizza Hut with its fifth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth. They have implemented the repeatable model for perfect pan pizza execution, the market also has renewed its focus on team member training, ensuring team member have the tools necessary to deliver an exceptional customer experience. As a result of these changes, customer satisfaction scores have improved over 9 percentage points versus the prior year. The team now has signed development agreements with our franchisees in India and I recently met with these franchisees and can feel there is enthusiasm for the brand. They are great examples of franchises to exhibit the three C's, capable, capitalized, committed; committed both to our brand and to our culture. ","With the perfect pan pizza team members are ready for action and the right partners in place, India is poised to accelerate its growth and we look forward to seeing the continued success in this market. ","Finally, Taco Bell, which represents approximately 30% of Yum!'s operating profit, by keeping to the core of Mexican inspired product with value and innovation Taco Bell delivered another solid quarter. This quarter system sales grew 6% with same store sales growth of 3% and net unit growth by 3%. ","During the quarter busy potato read out combined the powers of crispy potato bytes, season baked, cheddar cheese, nacho cheese sauce and a kick of creamy chipotle sauce all for just $1. This showcases Taco Bell's ability to deliver innovative products at an attractive value to the consumer. And the Double Chalupa, which included a double amount of seasoned beef, built on familiar cravable [ph] product while still delivering strong value in a $5 box. ","Now proven they are more than just food is fuel, the colder Taco Bell delivered on food as an experience by launching their own line of clothing and partnership with Forever 21, including crop sweat shirts, shirts, body suits and jackets. ","Taco Bell's first ever retail collaboration is inspired the iconic graphics that each brand is known for with a mix of vibrant prints. We understand the importance of reaching the consumer beyond the food and top of our given their fans another reason to celebrate. ","Internationally Taco Bell opens 15 new stores this quarter, Brazil continue to strong develop and has now open 17 stores over the past 12 months. I've mentioned before continue to unlock the business model by driving cost out of the supply chain and building scale with new and existing franchises. ","And India the great example of this, where we're now locally sourcing corn and equipments which significantly improved their margin. India and Brazil our two Taco Bell's four key growth market along with China and Canada. We continue to be excited about the potential for this brand internationally and changes to the supply chain such as those made in India will make the brand sustainable internationally over that long-term. ","In summary the focus on our four key growth drivers has delivered out strong third quarter results, building off a solid first half for the year, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and are confident in reiterating our 2017 guidance and transformation targets. ","And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and CFO, David Gibbs.","David Gibbs ","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results and full year outlook an update on our transformation initiative and how we are bringing two of our four key growth drivers to life, our bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. ","Yum! delivered another successful quarter with 11% core operating profit growth and 22% EPS growth excluding Special Items. During the quarter, the was minimal impact to operating profit from the timing difference between refranchises and the associated G&A savings referred to you as the net impact from refranchising dilution. Additionally, during the quarter, we spent approximately $10 million on incremental advertising at Pizza Hut as part of the transformation agreement. This was included in Pizza Hut operating profit. ","We are reiterating our 2017 full-year guidance of mid-single digit core operating profit growth. As a reminder this was derived from underlying based operating profit growth of high-single digits adjusted for the 53rd week and the net impact from refranchising dilution. ","We cautioned that the timing of the refranchising impact would be hard to predict. While we had limited net impact from refranchising dilution in the first quarters of the year, we expect this to be a significant headwind in the fourth quarter which is consistent with the 10 to 12 percentage points headwinds discussed during our second quarter earnings call. In addition, we expect 15 million of incremental Pizza Hut media investment in the fourth quarter or an additional 3 percentage points of headwind. ","Now with regards to our transformation initiative, we remain on track to deliver all aspects of our multiyear strategy of being more focused, more franchised and more efficient to deliver more growth. ","First more focus. This quarter was our second consecutive quarter of delivering 6% system sales growth, on our way to a bold goal of 7% system sales growth. ","Second, more franchise. This quarter we refranchised 209 units including 72 KFCs, 46 Pizza Huts and 91 Taco Bells, increasing to 95% franchise ownership. We continue to expect the majority of the refranchising to be completed in 2017 with the remainder to reach at least 98% franchise and less than 1,000 company owned restaurants to be complete by year-end 2018. ","Third more efficient. We continue to make progress towards our G&A goal of 1.7% of system sales excluding special items. Year-to-date CapEx is 228 million. We now anticipate approximately 300 million to 350 million in CapEx this year slightly lower just from our previous guidance of 350 million to 400 million. ","This will reduce in tandem with company ownership to approximately 100 million in ordinary cost of business CapEx by 2019. Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter we repurchased over 19 million shares at an average price of $69.","Our fully diluted share count as of quarter end was approximately 349 million. Combined with our quarterly dividends we have returned over 1.6 billion in 2017. We remain committed to returning between 6.5 and 7 billion to shareholders from 2017 to 2019. All of this is enabling us to deliver more growth and we remain on track to deliver at least $3.75 in EPS in 2019. ","Moving now to old restaurant developments, one of our four key growth drivers. During the quarter we opened 641 growth new units and 362 net new units to year-over-year net unit growth of 3%. ","Although we've not disclosed the breakdown of our long-term 7% system sales growth target between same stores sales growth and net growth, the key to achieving this over the long-term is to ensure a strong development pipeline is in place with growth minded franchises. ","We're attaching development agreement through our refranchising deals which are way for young to accelerate unit development across all three brands. We're confident in the unit growth potential for each of our brands with continue growth at KFC and Pizza Hut in both developed and emerging markets and international development for Taco Bell really just beginning. ","The growth minded franchisees behind our bold restaurant developments brings me to our fourth growth driver unmatched franchise operating capability. We talk about the three Cs required for our franchisees, capable, capitalized and committed. ","As an example of finding the right franchise partners demonstrating the three Cs, this quarter we consolidated our highly fragmented franchisee base for Pizza Hut in South Korea under one master franchisee. The consolidation of this market should allow us to streamline operations, enhance our growth prospects and accelerate development in a key market for Pizza Hut.","At KFC we recently celebrated founder's week, engaging all employees with Colonel Sanders and his passion for food. To honor the original celebrity chef, we celebrate the chef in each of our stores who hand bread, fresh chicken daily with recognition and by going back to the basics on operations, recertifying our chefs on making our world-famous products to ensure our food is served with the irresistible taste we all know and love. ","And at Taco Bell, Greg previously mentioned the supply chain initiatives in India positively impacting restaurant margins. It is operational enhancement such as these, which improve our unit level economics, strengthen our franchise partner's health and have us enthusiastic about unlocking the potential of Taco Bell globally. ","In conclusion we're pleased with our third quarter results, which build on a strong forecast and reinforce our confidence in the underlying strength of our business. Our strategic transformational initiatives and focus on four key growth drivers are setting us up to deliver more growth to our shareholders and we look forward to updating you as we progress on this journey. ","And with that the team and I are happy to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. ","Brian Bittner","Two questions first, you talked about accelerating towards your refranchising goal bit more rapidly from here, I think getting a lot done by the end of this year and that contributes to some near-term earnings headwinds which you clearly alluded for 4Q and I know you're not giving '18 guidance yet, so we be assuming our models that this refranchising dynamic also remains alluded factor in the first half of '18 and then starts to reverse to accretion in the later part of '18 and into '19, any color you can give us has 4Q will be helpful.","Greg Creed ","Yes Brian, I think that\u2019s a good way to look at it, obviously we have a lot more refranchising to do and that will be more dilutive and that\u2019s why we highlighted the issues related to that in the fourth quarter and that will continue into the first half of the year. ","Brian Bittner","Okay, and second question just on Pizza Hut U.S. Is there anything you can talk to regarding the early progress there we heard a competitor yesterday putting a lot of point on inner felt for a weak start to the fourth quarter so there is a lot of confusion swirling around regarding pizza in general and I know it's really early in your turnaround efforts but any light you can shed on how that's going?","David Gibbs ","I think to sort of answer two parts of the question. Look we also love live sports whether it's baseball, college football, NFL. We are not seeing any impact from any of that on our business and continue to obviously promote not just pizza but all of our brands on live sports. And then on Pizza Hut as I said, this is really us putting the foundations in place, the foundations are not always sexy but I think delivering hot reliable pizza is important and I do believe the team is making progress on all the areas in the foundation that will enable us to build longer term a strong Pizza Hut position. ","Greg Creed ","And I don\u2019t think that and there have been no real impacts to our business from any of the issues although I would point out as Pizza Hut is the official sponsor of the NCA and so we're happy about that partnership. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. ","John Glass ","First, just on your system sales growth goals of 7% and two of your brands one of them are KFC you very close it Taco Bell of obviously Pizza it's lagging that 7%. So first can you get to the 7% without Pizza Hut getting 7% itself and when you think about Pizza Hut can you get to 7% at Pizza Hut if that is a goal without the U.S. without accelerating. Can you maybe just what are the dynamics on the brands and maybe just dealing in Pizza Hut? ","Greg Creed ","Well, I think you just saw John we\u2019re making good progress obviously we're making good progress in KFC in developing and emerging markets as you saw [Indiscernible] is also is making great progress. We are also making progress at Pizza Hut on the international side of Pizza Hut we obviously had a good quarter I think system sales were down was 7% and obviously we are going to have to make quarter-over-quarter progress but as we said don\u2019t expect any heroics, but we do believe we can if I getting the foundations in place and doing the right things continue to progress our Pizza Hut U.S. performance. So, I just feel good about the performance we are making the steady progress we are making we are making the brands more distinctive and more relevant and easier and I think all of that is going to help us get to the long-term goal.","David Gibbs ","Yes, I think one of the ways to look at it as we have over 250 combinations of brands and countries so some of those brands in countries are going to be growing north of 10% and other will be growing less than 7%. Do we need Pizza Hut to get to 7% to get the entire systems to 7% no. As you can see as we've said KFCs has been performing at 7% and actually KFC U.S. is closing store more stores and they are opening right now we know that's going to reverse. So, we've got upside at all three brands and I know we are going to get there in different ways in different countries but in aggregate we've got our eyes focused on the price of 7%.","John Glass ","And if I can just follow-up, can you or maybe you did disclose some in the release and I missed it what the refranchising dilution is expected to be in the fourth quarter just as the lot of moving pieces in that quarter. Can you isolate the refranchising piece so we can get a better sense of how we think about the first half of '18?","Greg Creed ","I think we've categorized that as 10 to 12 percentage points of headwinds through a combination of refranchising dilution and the impact from the 53rd week, you can do the math on it but basically we will get into more details on that in the fourth quarter and the other challenge that we have with all of this refranchising is the timing is never really certain, these are deals that we're working on without side parties and they will close when they close, we don\u2019t want to close them before they should close or any later then they should close. It was very hard to predict exactly what that will be in the fourth quarter. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse.","Jason West","Just wondered if you can talk a bit about the competitive environment in the U.S., I guess thinking mostly Taco Bell, another good quarter there, you guys are holding up margins pretty good and we're seeing a lot of these companies in the space having invested in margin and seeing some labor pressure, just wanted to feel for, if you think you can grow margins in Taco Bell from here or should we look for investment to try to keep the sales where they are. ","David Gibbs ","Its defiantly a competitive market place, I think we all know that, which I think is even more encouraging with the results we delivered, Taco Bell had a solid quarter as you say plus 3% same stores sales growth, I think what Taco Bell is able to is to balance, being the value leader with an underlying economic model that delivers good industry leading margins. I think that team knows exactly how to ensure the we continue to grow same store sales while obviously protecting the sort of 20% plus margins, I got confidence though base value and innovation we will now continue to do that in the fourth quarter and going forward. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. ","David Palmer ","You mentioned confidence against the 2019 earnings goals, I think there was some curiosity now, ahead of 2019 its more on, those sustaining elements of the revenue growth which of course are the unit growth and delivery. Is there anything at this point, I know it's early, I know you probably have future analyst day's ahead, you want to talk about this more but updates about particularly the U.S. when it comes to delivery and international when it comes to unit growth and the confidence you have in traction and in any numbers or, that will be helpful. Thank you. ","David Gibbs ","Well on the unit front, I guess I point if you look at the number this quarter, we're close to 100 hundred units ahead of our net new unit development phase from last year, that\u2019s a pretty encouraging sign and effective if you look at gross units over 200 units ahead of the pace that we had. ","So, I think we feel like, just as we hit plans and the ramp up in unit development is happening slowly but surely and confident particularly internationally in having a lot more upside there and the U.S. off course a big opportunity on unit growth is reversing Pizza Hut U.S. and [AST] the U.S. to being net growing rather than decliners which is well on its way. ","Greg Creed ","I think that question on delivery, which is sort of easy part of distinct, relevant and easy, I mean the good news is we got a thousand Taco Bells delivering now obviously the KFC team as we said went off to the delivery summit with China so they picked up a lot of ideas on how to execute delivery, we go almost I think 20,000 brands with Yum! currently delivering, we got a lot of in house knowledge obviously with the pizza brand and obviously with KFC and places like the Middle East delivery. And obviously we're doing some testing work with aggregators. So, I think we're doing all the things that you would expect us to do when order to unleash the growth potential of delivery going forward. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gregory Frankfort with Bank of America. ","Gregory Frankfort","Maybe following up can you talked about how you think delivery played out in the U.S. in terms of getting the check size up and maybe how you think the bundled value meals fit into that kind of longer term to drive check size?","Greg Creed ","Sure. I think Greg the good news is the delivery that we are doing there are two things that are obviously, check does grow. Secondly that also a lot of it is new occasions. So, I think what we are excited about delivery actually gives us greater access to newer occasions and high checks. So, both of those will obviously help to drive system sales. I think right now into early days but what we are seeing is part of a check growth and a new occasion opportunity both of those obviously positive for our growth potential. ","Gregory Frankfort","And maybe one follow-up just on the international business it feels like across a bunch of different brands you've seen better numbers for the last couple of quarters from some of the international divisions any thoughts on the international consumer in and particularly out of Europe?","Greg Creed ","When you are in that 137 countries there is a lot of international consumers. Look, I think our business in Central and Eastern Europe is strong our KFC business in the UK is strong look I think where we built distinct relevant and easy brands which is really the cornerstone of driving our system sales growth and where we've got great franchise partners who are executing a great customer experience I think that's why we are continuing to see the success and the growth that we are around the world. So, look there will always be markets when you know as many of that have good macros and bad macros our job is to build distinct relevant and easy brands supported by unmatched franchise operating capability.","David Gibbs ","I think we've talked about this in past occasions but couple of years ago we made a change to organize globally around brands and that change principally benefitted the international [indiscernible] because we've already have been organized that way in the U.S. so I think part of this success we are seeing in building distinctive relevant brands is really what we keep talking about just more focused on the brands and sales dedicated 100% teams to the brands internationally working even closer with our franchise partners.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe ","The question is on KFC obviously a good quarter both from same-store sales and a unit development perspective. But you are considering that is your biggest division and it's kind of instill the drivers of the overall Yum! Engine. I just wanted to get a sense of what can accelerate from here at KFC in order to allowing the corporation to achieving 7% system wide sales growth. ","4% global comps I think it's in the above average number for the division is obviously something that you'd be proud of at any point and accelerating unit development beyond the 4% level that you are currently achieving on a unit base of 21,000 is obviously just a tough order just by the law of large numbers. So, I just want to get your sense of which are those -- what can accelerate from here at KFC or is this just a type of division that even if you are achieving 7% system wide sales growth as we think about in the next 3 to 5 years would just in of itself be a great level?","Greg Creed ","Well I think the good news -- I've talk about same store sales growth I think the good thing is that Roger Eaton, is doing a great job of getting everyone focused back on the call. So, if you think about the innovation that we've been doing it's all been innovation around core chicken on the bone. So, flavors delivered by chicken on the bone value, you have got everyone running $5 boxes, $10 share and $20 family meals, I think that\u2019s helping delivering, obviously, we do believe that the KFC brand, I joke internally that the Colonel we're going to deliver and that\u2019s why he made the bucket 60 years ago, because there is better delivery vehicle then a bucket of chicken. ","So, I think that for all of those reasons, focus on the core, flavor around the core, pride in the core and then obviously great execution plus then delivery, I think will gives us with the confidence that even through this is a big brand and yes it has a lot of big number that this brand can continue deliver like it's been delivering for the past few quarters and I remain firmly confident that this brand will continue to deliver. ","John Ivankoe ","So that 4% type of comp level, is something you think that this execution, delivery sounds like it's an achievable number over the long-term, what about on the restaurant side, I mean does it make sense means would you want the 21,000-unit brand to accelerate beyond 4% system wide unit growth year-on-year. ","Greg Creed ","Obviously, we talked but that\u2019s we're not provide brand by brand guidance on development but your question is well placed John, of course we like to see all of our brands pick up the pace of development, KFC is building a lot of units but it also describes the service and so many markets the world, I know the KFC team is continually looking for ways to accelerate development and you\u2019re seeing some of that happening this year. ","John Ivankoe ","And something that a lot of companies kind of experience both in a good way and a bad way as, 1000 or 2000 units globally in a year can be too much, there is two things, one is franchise capability and demand and secondly as the level that you think is right for the brand to grow in terms of units, and so I'm just trying to get a sense of what that maximum limit is, or perhaps the really is that one that as there is market to market build up that it continues to make sense to accelerate that development. ","Greg Creed ","I think two things, John I think as David said, in the large part of the world, we got less than one unit for million population, a large part of the world, you would argue we would be under penetrated compared to sort of develop market economics. ","The second thing is, I think as we gone through this transformation, as we refranchise the business, we build in as we said stronger franchises, so about our existing franchise base, we\u2019re very happy with and the new franchises with development agreement attached to all of this, which traditionally we haven't done but as well as with the capability and the commitment and the capacity to actually do this development. So, I think for those reasons, we feel good about the KFC branding out to deliver both same store sales growth and net new unit growth, this year, next year the year after and the year after that. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matthew McGinley with Evercore ISI. ","Matthew McGinley ","I guess I have a follow up on that unit development question, it's very obviously very encouraging to see that pick up in the unit growth but as you look at the present unit growth that you had over the past, through this quarter or past quarter do you know how much of that is normal development growth pipeline versus the contractual commitments you're receiving from refranchising or the contractual commitment that you get from when a franchisee turns over and curious of the, uptake that we're seeing now is could accelerate because we're not actually getting those refranchising type commitments and the numbers yet. ","Greg Creed ","I think it's fair to say that some of the refranchising commitments have started to impact the pace of development but remember with the time frames around development and when we just really restarted this batch of refranchising little bit over a year ago a lot of these deals were in the pipeline before the refranchising began so it's starting to have an impact and then we hope that it will continue to avenue impact of even greater magnitude as we go forward. ","Matthew McGinley ","And on a G&A decline by 300 million as it relates to the refranchising you've said that extensive would be done with that refranchising by year-end. What causes a lag between refranchising and G&A reductions as your asset based trends. I mean you has the due to store related G&A I mean you have the headquarters G&A kind of curious of how the perhaps the headquarters G&A would lag or lead that refranchising that would drop those G&A dollars?","Greg Creed ","I guess also to clarify we've said the majority of the refranchising would be done by year-end but we certainly will have some refranchising that will still be in 2018. And then as far as what might be a lagging item on the G&A versus the refranchising of stores just to give you like an obvious one in some international markets if we're selling the entire market we might have office lease obligations, we might have to do a lot of things with employees to continue during the transition period to a franchise owner organization all of that would be lagging the actual transfer to restaurants at a restaurants level profitability that we would going to with the franchises.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. ","Dennis Geiger ","Can you provide any more detail on what you are seeing from those refranchise initiatives in place at Pizza Hut in the U.S. at this early stage anything on loyalty the new thermal power, it's the new app or the marketing spend maybe if it's just customers satisfaction metrics maybe what the franchises are seeing any of the incremental detail would be great? Thanks.","Greg Creed ","I think it's just a nice positive build I think the good news is when QSR magazine came out and rated [indiscernible] genius category I think we were only second behind Starbucks in a sort of group with Dominos, so we feel really good that our asset is being recognized at least within the industry. ","So, no, I think we are making progress, its early days. I know the advertising for hot pouches has just started as we said you will get to a crispier, hotter, when they next experience Pizza Hut. So, I think we are doing all the right things. Our loyalty is now underway making progress on that, we are happy with that progress. So, I think we are just starting to do all the right foundational blocking and tackling things and I'm pleased with the progress that we are making on all of those fronts.","Dennis Geiger ","If I can get more in with the roughly 600 restaurants refranchised year-to-date till the end of the quarter anything more you say about those transactions I guess and just specifically any commentary on the development agreements coming out of those I'm sure there is only so much you can say but as far as number of years just to think about anywhere that kind of contractualize that? Thanks.","Greg Creed ","Yes, I think first of all we are pleased with the prices we are getting for refranchising as I've mentioned on previous calls. There is the strong market for the stores that we are refranchising and lots of capital out there available for these kinds of deals and similarly with that capital availability we've got franchises willing to sign up for development commitments we've got generally very good unit level economics in most of the countries we operate in, so yes, I think it's been a very positive story in terms of the reception to the refranchising program.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Co. ","Andrew Charles ","Greg where the quick service industry increasing focus more recently on the $1 to $3 price points, it seems likely to intensify early next year, looking to talk about differentiate on value, given the brand with the only national QSR with the $1 menu over the less five years and then I have a follow up. ","Greg Creed ","I think as I said earlier the great thing is we can grow $1 all day, all night, all week, all month, all quarter and still have great margins. We got a really good underlying economic model at Taco Bell, we will never give up that leadership of value in the QSR category, I can assure you that, I know Brian and team are very focused, they what\u2019s going on the market place, but I think we're very confident, we execute our plans given the context of what's occurring that we can still be very competitive in that price range. ","Andrew Charles ","Thanks, and then David what lead to minimal profit dilution from a franchising in 3Q while you guys were ahead of schedule in the franchising activity and further what expense should we expect the franchising dilution to be most evident in 4Q and early 2018.","David Gibbs ","The minimal profit dilution in the first part of the year, obviously some of this depends on what kind of stores you're selling, if you're selling to stores with lower margin and you're collecting royalty in some cases, you can see a positive impact from the refranchising. In terms of where these things are going to show up in our P&L obviously you will see our margins going down brand by brand, you will see G&A going down and then franchise and license expense going up, particularly when we refranchise stores that we end up holding on to real estate or remaining on lease obligations, we have to recognize the brands and depreciation to the franchise and license expense line. ","Operator","Okay your final question is coming from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. ","Sara Senatore ","I have a quick follow up on pizza and then I wanted to ask about Latin America, the first on pizza, I was just, I know you, if I didn\u2019t see any real impact from NFL viewership, but it does seem like the category aggregate has slowed so, Greg has mentioned the idea of delivering being part of easy and I'm wondering if it\u2019s the fact that so many other restaurants are pursuing this kind of easy component through delivery, is that having any impact and then like I said I have a second question about Latin America, please. ","Greg Creed ","I think a lot of people are trying to get into the easy delivery business but I think we got a track record of doing it for so many years, we obviously have a system that knows how to deliver, I think what we\u2019ve done is we doubled down we hired 14,000, we'll be hiring 14,000 more drivers as we said to deliver. We have the team operationally focused on making sure that we improve of speed of service, we make the pizzas hot, you can now track it, you got a loyalty program. So even though I think, obviously competition is heating up in this area, I also think we're raising our performance and I think that will keep, continue to keep in competitive in this market place. ","Sara Senatore ","Okay thank you and then just on the Latin America business, you talked about it very positively and I think from those the time that I been following you and it going to be in the shadow of emerging Asia and particular. Are you seeing sort of a quantitative or qualitative difference in performance there and does that change potentially? How you think about the balance of your global growth going forward?","Greg Creed ","As we think we said, what I love is we've got this content of repeatable model and it's very clear that when we execute all best practice to repeatable model, it has impact, so the Latin America KFC performance I spoke about was really about implementing the repeatable model, maybe so we had value and then innovation around chicken flavored chicken on the bone. ","We\u2019ve also got as we talked about the talk about our Brazilian business now we got 17 restaurants which we've opened in 12 months so that was a market that we were in for that brand in the past so, look I think we just feel confident that by executing the repeatable model and growing our presence with a brand like Taco Bell, we can get more growth out Latin America.","Sara Senatore ","Thank you.","Greg Creed","Okay. So, I'd like to thank everyone for being on the call today. I think we delivered another strong quarter, we are firmly on track to achieve our 2019 transformation goals. I do believe we are focused on the right key growth drivers and now for all of office about execute, execute, execute. So, thank you for being with us. Thank you for supporting us, we look forward to speaking you in the future. Thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"22682":["Yum!

Restaurants International and most recently Yum!'s Chief Planning and Control Officer. Pat will provide comments today, review our financial performance and David will provide comments today on the call as well.","Now I'll turn the call over to David Novak, our Chairman and CEO.","David C. Novak","Thank you very much, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report we generated strong system sales growth at each of our divisions, China, Yum! Restaurants International, in the United States and India. In the second quarter, we did this with robust new unit development and exceptional same-store sales growth. Operating profit increased 8% while EPS growth of 1% was negatively impacted, as expected, by a higher tax rate compared to last year. Our U.S. business increased operating profit 26% in the second quarter and drove our overall operating profit growth. Based on our first half results and solid current sales trends, we reconfirm our full year guidance of at least 12% EPS growth, excluding special items.","In China, our strategy is to build leading brands in every significant category. System sales increased 27%, or 23% excluding the sales associated with our acquisition of Little Sheep. This increase was driven by an 18% increase in new units and a 10% same-store sales growth. We opened 160 new restaurants in the quarter and are pleased to raise our full year projection for new restaurants in China to at least 700 from our previous guidance of at least 600. And that will be a new record. Despite this extraordinary top line growth, I'm sure you noticed operating profit was down 4% versus last year before foreign currency benefit due to a 4 percentage point decline in restaurant margin. We expect this to be short-lived as our menu initiatives, including pricing, begin to take hold and inflation moderates. As a result, we expect modest margin improvement in the second half of this year and double-digit profit growth. Pat Grismer, our CFO, will be taking you through this in more detail during his remarks.","There's no question that China economy is slowing and sales for retailers, including us, will likely soften, especially as we overlap such strong performance from last year. We continue to be confident in our strategy of driving affordability to the growing consuming class and is backed by an extremely strong business model, which is driving record new unit development. Now given what we're all reading about the Chinese economy, I'm sure the question on your mind is: What are our expectations for sales growth in the second half of the year in China? As you know, there are 2 components of our system sales growth, new unit development and same-store sales. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to build a record number of new units in China this year. So I think it's safe to say we feel pretty good about our new unit potential continuing to drive substantial growth, not only this year but over the long term. The most compelling stat we have is we only have 4 restaurants per 1 million people in China compared to nearly 60 in the United States. And the consuming class is expected to double to over 600 million people by 2020.","As for same-store sales growth, our results over the past 6 quarters have been sensational. And we've said to you before, we simply cannot expect this double-digit pace to continue over time, although we do expect to do well. Keep in mind, we'll be overlapping 20% same-store sales growth from the second half of last year. So while it's difficult to call, our expectation is that we should be in the mid-single-digit range as we overlap last year's incredible growth.","One of the things I'm most still pleased with is that by the end of the year, our average unit volumes will be $1.7 million for KFC and Pizza Hut dine-in. And not only has this number grown 25% over the past 5 years in local currency, but that's on top of doubling the number of restaurants we now have in China. Even more impressive, the top 10% of our restaurants now have volumes of nearly $3 million. So clearly, we have a strong track record of growing same-store sales and units with plenty of room to continue this growth.","KFC now has 3,917 restaurants in China with average unit volumes of $1.7 million, and continues to expand to new cities, as well as increase its penetration in existing markets. We continue to make progress expanding dayparts and building new sales layers that further leverage these nearly 4,000 KFC assets. Virtually all KFCs in China serve breakfast, which now accounts for 7% of sales, half offer delivery service and over half have 24-hour operations. The good news is we know we're in the early innings with these initiatives and have sales growth ahead.","Pizza Hut Casual Dining now has 696 restaurants and continues to open successfully, even in the lower-tier cities. Its strategy to offer tremendous variety, everyday value and refresh 25% of its menu twice per year has consistently driven sales and profit growth. In fact, this marks the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit same-store sales growth at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. I'd like to congratulate Peter Cowl [ph], our entire -- our Pizza Hut General Manager, and the entire Pizza Hut team for this tremendous accomplishment. Based on how the Pizza Hut team has broaden its appeal, you may have noticed that we are now successfully opening new stores more aggressively including Tier 3, 4 and 5 cities. In fact, we saw a 28% increase in new units this quarter for Pizza Hut Casual Dining. Clearly, Pizza Hut Casual Dining, like KFC, is a power brand in China.","Importantly, new unit returns for our 2 leading brands in China, both KFC and Pizza Hut, are among the best in our business with cash paybacks within 3 years. We also continue to make progress developing our emerging brands in China. Pizza Hut Home Service now has 139 units and East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, now has 30 restaurants. We're also in the midst of integrating Little Sheep, the leading hot pot brand in China, into the Yum! portfolio. We obviously acquired Little Sheep to strengthen its operating model and increase its market leadership position.","I want to point out that results have been soft since before its acquisition and the trend has continued post acquisition. Due in part to the long approval process and transition, we're behind where we expected to be. We are, however, beginning to see sales stabilize. We know this is a powerful brand and we have the expertise to make it even stronger. We have completed management integration into Yum!'s China team and have new initiatives moving through the pipeline. We didn't buy this business for its 400-plus units, we bought this brand for its potential to join Pizza Hut as the unquestionable leaders in casual dining and the potential to open thousands more restaurants. I'm confident our team is taking the necessary steps to build this business for the long term.","Moving on to Yum! Restaurants International, you may recall that Graham Allan retired from our company late last year. Micky Pant has taken over the reins and is making major headway. We are realigning Yum! Restaurants International, shifting more resources to the field and have organized our know-how building around emerging and developed markets. In fact, Micky and Sam Su, our Yum! Vice Chairman and China CEO, conducted a know-how building seminar which lasted a week in Shanghai for emerging markets, all our general managers in major franchisees that head emerging markets. And this proved to be a great example of how we're leveraging our people capability to make our global brands even stronger. The China model is obviously a winner and we want to spread it across the emerging markets.","Our strategy at Yum! Restaurants International remains to be to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere. System sales increased 7% in the second quarter prior to foreign currency translation. Units increased 3% and overall same-store sales grew 4%, while operating profit increased 6% in the quarter. We continue to produce strong results in YRI\u2019s high-growth emerging markets with system sales growth of 13%, led by 9% same-store sales growth and a 7% increase in units. Our new unit growth potential in emerging markets is arguably the best in retail. With less than 2 restaurants per 1 million people in the world's 10 largest emerging markets, we know we have a long, long runway for future growth.","We're especially pleased with our sales performance in Russia with system sales growth of 44%, including 32% same-store sales growth, which is the best in our business. Our transition from Rostik's-KFC to standalone KFC is about 90% complete and having a positive impact with our customers as we focus on improving operations and offer compelling value. These results give us even more confidence we can build a strong, profitable business in Russia. Micky Pant, Rick Carucci and I will be traveling to Russia in August and will give you more color on this exciting growth opportunity during our next call.","In Africa, another of our strategic markets, we continue to drive aggressive expansion throughout the continent. By the end of the year, we expect to be in about 20 African countries with tremendous growth potential. The projected population growth in African countries like Nigeria is staggering, and we're establishing market leadership positions with KFC to capitalize on this opportunity. We expect the vast majority of our growth in Africa to be franchise-driven. We acquired 70 restaurants in South Africa last year to establish brand leadership and help drive franchise expansion across the continent.","In Western Europe, our brands are significantly underpenetrated. We continue to believe Europe is a significant long-term growth opportunity. We believe this because our restaurants in France have the highest average unit volumes in the world for KFC. We continue to build our scale in increased television advertising. It's no secret that McDonald's has over 2,600 restaurants and makes over $1 billion in France and Germany alone. We only have 218 KFC restaurants and make less than $30 million, so we know there's substantial room to grow into a major business in the years to come. With that said, we struggled in France in the second quarter with a decline in same-store sales of 4%. We remain confident in our strategy and continue to utilize a franchise business rental model to drive new unit development and returns. We've also taken this approach to Germany, where we have an even higher transactions than France and should have the necessary scale to utilize TV advertising next year.","Clearly, Europe has its challenges, so we expect our third quarter results to be choppy as we go after a much bigger prize for the long term. For YRI overall, operating profit grew 7% in the first half of the year driven by solid sales performance. In the second half of the year, we expect healthy top line growth, improved restaurant margins and less G&A spending versus a year ago to drive improved profit performance.","In the United States, our strategy is to dramatically improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. The good news is we had another great quarter with operating profit up 26%. Taco Bell, our most profitable U.S. brand, led the way with 13% same-store sales growth and the historic launch of Doritos Locos Tacos. We're also excited about the July launch of Cantina Bell with its exciting new ingredients like whole black beans, cilantro, white rice and corn pepper sauce, inspired by celebrity chef Lorena Garcia. This initiative is designed to broaden the appeal of Taco Bell, offering vast casual-type products at 2\/3 the price. If you haven't tried these products, you've got to get out and do it. Along with Doritos Locos Tacos, we have made major headway at Taco Bell and are extremely optimistic about the future.","We continue to make progress with First Meal and plan to have breakfast at Taco Bell nationally by 2014. Greg Creed and his dedicated team and our franchisees are totally committed at taking Taco Bell to new heights and have worked very hard to reignite the power of the brand. A couple of weeks ago, I met with the Taco Bell franchisees at the Top to Top Summit, and they are very enthusiastic about where we're heading and are excited about all the quality upgrades and product innovation that we have and are committed to growing this great brand. Now one thing you should recognize is the launch of Doritos Locos Tacos represents one of the biggest breakthroughs in our industry. In fact, innovations like this don't come along very often. So while there's no question Taco Bell is on its way to having an outstanding year and laying the foundation for the future, we're not counting on double-digit same-store sales growth going forward.","Now Pizza Hut delivered another solid quarter of results. Its combination of leveraging value, using its $10 large pizzas and bundling complete meals in $10 and $20 boxes with chicken, breadsticks and desserts, this, along with the traditional Pizza Hut pizza innovation, continues to resonate with our consumers. We've also entered the sandwich category with the P'Zolo and continue to innovate with products like the new garlic bread pizza. Scott Bergren, our Pizza Hut CEO, and his entire team are committed to growth, and I'm confident that Pizza Hut will continue to build on its track record and success and drive consistent growth.","At KFC in the U.S., our business is stabilizing. We're working with our franchisees and profits are improving. Overall, our U.S. business had a strong first half. I'm especially pleased with the strong sales momentum and tremendous innovation at Taco Bell and the sustained growth at Pizza Hut, where we have definitely solved our value equation. I'm confident we're improving our business model in the U.S., but we all understand there's a tremendous amount of work yet to do and we're excited to continue to get after it.","Now let's talk about our India Division, where our brands are all about the youth and providing an aspirational experience for our customers. We have 479 restaurants in our India Division and expect to open over 100 new units this year. Our business model is getting stronger and stronger every day, working in both large and smaller cities. I just returned from India, and I could not be more excited about our growth prospects with 4 brands, KFC, Pizza Hut Casual Dining, Pizza Hut Home Service and Taco Bell. The brand has gone to school on what makes KFC and Pizza Hut so successful in China, and we're applying these strategies to India. Based on the unit economics we're seeing, we believe there's a compelling reason to put even more capital work at KFC in India.","Overall, while we're making substantial progress, we don't anticipate meaningful profit contributions from our India Division for the next couple of years. We are laying the foundation for this business to have a significant impact on Yum!'s profit growth in the future. Just like China, we want to have leading brands in every significant category in India.","In summary, the Yum! business is in very good shape and we look forward to a solid second half and full year EPS growth of at least 12%.","Now let me hand it over to Pat Grismer, our Chief Financial Officer.","Patrick Grismer","Thank you, David. Today, I'm going to comment on our second quarter results and our expectations for the second half of the year. Also, with the step change that we've achieved in new unit growth, I'm going to provide some perspective on how we're building momentum in retail development.","Overall, second quarter financial results were marked by very strong top line performance with a worldwide system sales growth of 8% driving operating profit growth of 7%, excluding the impact of special items and foreign currency. Although EPS was up only 1% on a comparable basis, this was after an expected 10 percentage point impact of lapping last year's unusually low second quarter tax rate of 16.7%.","In China, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit same-store sales growth, an impressive system sales growth of 23%, excluding the impact of our Little Sheep acquisition. This was offset by a 4.1 percentage point decline in restaurant margin and a significant investment in G&A to further extend our unique growth capabilities. For the second quarter and year-to-date, our margin decline in China was driven by persistent high inflation, labor investments to expand our strategic sales layers, like 24-hour operations and delivery and the incremental costs associated with the ramp-up of our restaurant development program.","Our first half margin of 19.1% was about 1 percentage point lower than we had originally expected, largely due to the manner in which we implemented our pricing actions. As Rick explained on our first quarter call, we've recently adopted a more targeted and strategic approach to our pricing in China to drive everyday affordability for the growing consumer class while achieving about 20% margins over time. To that end, our plan included a phased implementation of price increases, as well as an increase in the number of pricing tiers across the country to better match our pricing to trade area-specific purchasing power and operating costs. While we're confident in this approach, it has taken more time to implement than we expected, and coupled with the restaurant labor investments necessary to enable our increased pace of development, has driven margin below our forecast.","Clearly, we're not happy with a 4.1 percentage point margin decline in China even though this is short term. However, our pricing is now in place and we look at the process we've used as a responsible investment in the long-term growth of our business. This approach protects our consumer value proposition, supports an accelerated pace of new restaurant openings and helps us to achieve about 20% margins on a sustainable basis. We believe this is a winning long-term strategy. Later on, I'm going to talk about why we expect our China margin will improve modestly in the second half of the year.","At Yum! Restaurants International, we delivered solid system sales growth of 7% and operating profit growth of 6%, excluding foreign currency translation. Emerging markets continue to be Yum! Restaurants International's growth engine with 9% same-store sales growth and 8% operating profit growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency. In addition to Russia, as David mentioned, we were very happy with the double-digit system sales growth in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, further demonstrating the strength of our emerging market position. Additionally, over 60% of YRI's new units were opened in emerging markets.","Despite strong sales overall, YRI's restaurant margin was down 1.1 percentage points in the quarter, driven by temporary cost pressures in Thailand and a same-store sales decline in France, partially offset by improved margin performance at Pizza Hut U.K. From a G&A perspective, YRI decided to restructure for stronger field support. We believe this will position us to grow faster in the long term, but we incurred $5 million of one-time costs in the quarter related to this decision.","In the U.S., we had very strong performance from each of our brands with operating profit up 26% in the quarter. I was especially encouraged by the fact that each of our U.S. brands delivered same-store sales, margin and profit growth for the second consecutive quarter. Please note that 26% operating profit growth was after the resolution of a California employment lawsuit at Taco Bell, which resulted in a pretax charge of $17 million in the quarter.","U.S. restaurant margin was a very healthy 17.5% for the quarter, including 19.4% at Taco Bell and 17.8% at Pizza Hut. Our overall increase of 5.8 percentage points over prior year largely resulted from sales leverage, as well as continued progress on supply-chain efficiency. On the latter point, Pizza Hut has led the U.S. system, a recent example being a redesigned pizza box which has not only yielded substantial cost savings, but has reduced environmental impact as well.","Stepping back and looking at the first half of the year, I'm pleased with the overall quality of our growth as 8% system sales growth prior to foreign currency translation converted to 12% operating profit growth, which in turn drove an 11% increase in EPS prior to special items. Demonstrating the power of Yum!'s portfolio, the temporary margin decline in China was offset by a resurgence in our U.S. business led by outstanding performance at Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable U.S. brand.","Now I'm going to talk about our expectations for the second half of the year, when we expect our China and YRI businesses will deliver a larger share of our overall earnings growth. In China, while it took longer than we anticipated, we now have our pricing in place. With the significant reduction in food inflation, we anticipate modest year-over-year margin improvement in the second half breaking the pattern of recent margin declines. This is prior to the inclusion of Little Sheep, which could adversely affect our restaurant margin percentage by about 1 percentage point in the third quarter as hot pot sales are seasonally low in the warmer summer months. This margin improvement, combined with healthy same-store sales growth and continued strength in new unit development, will deliver strong double-digit profit growth for China in the second half of the year.","Looking ahead, we continue to believe our China restaurant margin will sustain around the 20% level over time. Let me take you through the 4 main reasons why we believe this. First, we have the unique ability to grow our business across the entire country with unmatched development resources and a proprietary distribution network. This enables us to increase our mix of higher-margin restaurants located in lower-tier, lower-cost cities, offsetting the lower margins of Tier 1 cities, where rent and labor costs are relatively high. Second, we're growing Pizza Hut Home Service and East Dawning, our emerging brands, which dilute restaurant margin by about 0.5 percentage point today. As we scale these businesses and improve their unit economics, overall margin should benefit. Third, we have potential upside from restaurant productivity initiatives and expect to gain more supply-chain efficiencies over time as we continue to leverage our size. And fourth, we have a strong track record. Consider this: over the past 5 years, our China restaurant margin has averaged a little over 20% with a low of 19% as we drove average unit volumes up by 25% in real terms even as we doubled our restaurant count in an inflationary environment. Taking all these factors together, we're confident that we can achieve and maintain margins of about 20% in China for the foreseeable future.","At YRI, we expect solid sales growth to continue balance of year. We also expect improved margin performance, accelerated net unit development and more moderate G&A growth in the second half. These factors combined set up YRI for stronger profit growth in the back half of the year. We also plan to complete the refranchising of our Pizza Hut U.K. business later this year and expect this transaction to be accretive to earnings going forward.","In the United States, we expect modest profit growth in the third quarter but have a fourth quarter headwind of $18 million as we lapped last year's 53rd week. We expect full year U.S. margin improvement of about 3 percentage points. We also continue to make progress with our refranchising objectives. By the end of this year, we expect our ownership level to be around 5% at Pizza Hut and KFC. We expect to retain a higher ownership level at Taco Bell, but to reduce our current ownership from 22% to about 16% by the end of next year. We believe this will lead to even better results for our shareholders over time. In summary for the full year, we're expecting significant profit growth from each of our divisions, led by strong sales performance across our entire business. And when you add it all together, we expect full year EPS growth of at least 12%, excluding special items.","Now I want to take a minute and talk about the momentum we're building in new unit development. As you know, our ongoing profit growth model is very much new unit-driven. The good news for our shareholders is that our development pipeline and capability have never been stronger. And because of that, we're now projecting a record 1,700 new international units in 2012. With now 1,000 people on our development team in China, we have unparalleled resources and know-how to take our growth to the next level. As David mentioned, we have raised our China development forecast to at least 700 new units which not only extends our position as the largest and fastest-growing retail developer in China, but also expands the first-mover advantage that has underpinned many years of exceptional growth. When you consider that this equates to opening about 2 company-owned restaurants per day with cash paybacks averaging less than 3 years, you can appreciate the shareholder value created by this extraordinary development program.","At YRI, which is about 90% franchised, we expect to open about 900 new restaurants this year, over 60% of which will be opened in high-growth emerging markets. This pace of development demonstrates the attractive investment returns that our restaurants offer and reflects the underlying health of our brands in many parts of the world. In India, we're just getting started and expect to open over 100 new restaurants this year, led by equity investments at KFC, where our investment returns have averaged over 20%. With YRI and India combined, we expect to open a record of at least 1,000 new international restaurants this year outside of China.","Although we tend to focus on our international development opportunity, the fact is that in 2012, we'll also have our highest number of new unit openings in the U.S. since 2002. We've modestly increased net units at Taco Bell for 4 consecutive years and look for the pace of development to increase going forward. At Pizza Hut, 2012 will mark the second consecutive year of net unit growth after a decade of declines as our low-cost delivery carryout units are gaining traction in the system.","Overall, I'm obviously very pleased with our step change in new unit development. As we said before, there are 3 main drivers of shareholder value: new unit development, same-store sales growth and high returns. As CFO, it's comforting to know that a large portion of our EPS growth is in the ground before we even start each year. And with record new unit development expected this year, we've never felt better about our future growth.","David, back to you.","David C. Novak","Thank you very much, Pat. Appreciate it. So in summary, the Yum! business is in very good shape and we look forward to a solid second half and full year EPS growth of at least 12%. So with that, we'll open it up for any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Palmer.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The reason for that profit shortfall in China, it's not the usual one which we generally anticipate would be sales or maybe a food cost spike. You mentioned some reasons, the slower-than-expected pricing rollout, the accelerated unit development and why the margins were down last quarter more than expected. But obviously, The Street is hearing about these reasons more now after the quarter than we heard before. You're giving some comforting guidance and commentary about your margin opportunities in China for the second half and beyond. But the natural question comes back to Yum!'s forecasting ability for that China Division. Have you thought about that and how you can better anticipate your profit performance and communicate that to The Street going forward?","Richard T. Carucci","All right. David, why don't I take that since I was the one who gave the previous forecast. China is a pretty difficult business to forecast now than compared to, let's say, 5 years ago. If you go back a long time ago, almost all of our profit growth was generated by new unit development. We could count on cost of sales being pretty stable and us getting synergies in that area, et cetera. So we pretty much were able to grow our bottom line with our top line. If you look at it, there are just more moving pieces today. There's higher labor inflation, a lot more volatility on commodities than there used to be. And probably the only thing I think we missed is we may be missed some of the inefficiencies of going from 500 new units a year to 700 new units a year. So I think we did have some teething problems around new unit development and its impact on operations, and perhaps maybe we could have anticipated better. But whenever you have a high company-owned business, China's 90% company-owned or so, you're going to have volatility when you have same-store sales and cost of sales moving. So I think that -- and then you have an uncertain economic situation to look at there. The piece that we sort of anticipated but maybe not the extent of it is we did know sort of a quarter ago that we were going to have pricing impact. And when we started executing that pricing impact, we just stretched it out a little longer than what we thought at that point last year. And that was just sort of an underground decision based on the reactions that we were getting as we were putting that in place. But as Pat said, those are done now. So from a pricing standpoint, we've pretty much done the lion's share of what's going to impact the balance of the year.","Patrick Grismer","And David, the other thing I would add to what Rick has said is that we had effectively guided that margins in the quarter would be down about 3 points. And they were, in fact, down about 4 points, so we missed it by about 1 point. So yes, it was a bit off from what we had indicated. But to Rick's point, the team on the ground is in the best position to read what's happening in the retail environment and to make the right decisions as it relates to how we execute our pricing actions, and then their judgment that made sense and we support them on this to go a little bit slower.","David C. Novak","And just the overall strategy, remember, is that what we want to do is to continue to drive affordable accessibility for the growing consumer class. We thought of -- and that's one of the big things that's been driving us. And what I continually tell the team is keep polishing the diamond, okay? We've got great, great brands there, keep making our brands affordable, make sure we have great operations, make sure the assets looks great and the numbers will take care of themselves. And we obviously take a great deal of pride in doing what we say, and I think we have a very good internal forecasting process. And we try to do the very best job we can guiding. And we were off 1 point in China this quarter. But I'm not going to apologize for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ask about the price increases that you're taking in China, given the timing. It seems like there might be a risk, at least in my mind, to traffic trends if you're taking prices when McDonald's seems to me investing in value, local competitors will have more P&L room for promotions. Given last year's food inflation, consumers are perhaps becoming a little more value-conscious over there. Can you talk about maybe some of the early experiences you've had now with the price increases in place and how you mitigate that risk?","Patrick Grismer","Well, Michael, first, as to the extent of pricing that we took, as we said, the pricing was phased in over time. And that was in the low single-digit range, in the range of 3% to 4%. Moreover, the team put a great deal of thought into how and where to take that pricing based on their analysis of purchasing power and cost. And that's why we decided to take it slow. The team is very sensitive to the consumer environment currently and clearly, as David mentioned, is interested in maintaining the strong value position that we offer consumers. So in our judgment, we believe that the amount of pricing that we took was entirely appropriate based on what we've read over time. And so we do not expect that there's going to be an adverse consumer reaction to the amount of pricing that we've recently implemented.","David C. Novak","Yes. The last thing the customer is going to see in China is sticker shock, okay? So I think we've done a very prudent job of managing pricing, and again, with the primary objective of being affordable. And I think that continues to be the case, and we're not really concerned about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason West of Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just another question on China. You talked, David, about a sort of mid-single-digit expectation on the back half of the year. Just if you could give us any color on how things progressed through the quarter, if you're starting to see some signs of stabilization that gives you comfort with that number. Or are you still seeing consumers tighten their belts and it's unclear when things will stop deteriorating there?","David C. Novak","We really don't comment on how we're proceeding during the quarter. I just think that we're very confident in our long-term business model in China. And we think we're making each of our brand stronger this year. And we'll report our numbers out like we always do and not before it.","Patrick Grismer","And Jason, the other thing I would add is that I think it's important to look at our comps on a 2-year basis, right? So as David said in his speech a couple of times, as we enter the back half of the year, we are lapping an extraordinary performance, right? Over the back half of last year, same-store sales were about 20%. So with that said and given how we performed in the first half of the year, we stand by our forecast for balance of year. It's single-digits on average.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to perhaps shift gears to the U.S. business, a two-part question. First, I was wondering whether you can assess how you view the competitive dynamic. It seems like we're seeing a little bit more aggressive value and promotional activity at a couple of your larger burger peers and others. And even in the pizza segment, we're seeing something similar. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the landscape as we look to the back half of the year. And then perhaps as an aside, with people pushing value, I'm just wondering whether you can give us an update on the commodity inflation, perhaps for each segment of '12. I know there's obviously been a spike more recently. And I'm just wondering whether you have confidence in your second half outlook, whether there's any volatility to that or whether the risk is more to '13 from a commodity standpoint?","Richard T. Carucci","I'll handle the environment before we get into commodities. I would call the U.S. as sort of in a process of a rocky recovery. So you do see from an industry standpoint, you see sort of a couple of good months and then a bad month and similar from a week-to-week basis. So things are not great and they're not terrible. They're sort of mediocre in terms of the marketplace right now. In terms of our business, I feel pretty good with -- I feel very good about the programs that we have in place. David talked about Pizza Hut, Taco Bell on the call. And if I look at the balance of year for Pizza Hut and KFC in terms of the plans we have in place, I feel good about our ability to be positive in the back part of the year.","Patrick Grismer","And Jeffrey, as to your question on inflation, relative to the guidance we provided in New York on full year inflation for each one of our divisions, based on what is happening in commodity markets, what we're currently forecasting is low single-digits inflation in each one of our divisions. And as we mentioned earlier in our remarks, that's one of the reasons why we're confident that we'll see the modest improvement in margins in China in the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Buckley from Bank of America.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to follow up on that. So the food cost inflation in China, you're saying the second half of the year will be up low single-digits? Or has it subsided enough as you could see that for the full year?","Patrick Grismer","Yes. More on a full year basis, what we're seeing is low single-digits in China. Certainly, it would be close to flat even in the back half of the year for China, including in the fourth quarter the prospect of some deflation, given that we are lapping very high inflation last year.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a couple of other questions on the China margin and some just to clarify what's already said. So do you think the 20% China restaurant-level margin is attainable this year? Or given the shortfall this quarter, will be below that, do you think?","Patrick Grismer","It will be very difficult for us to get to 20% this year because of the decline we experienced in Q2. We see that we're going to be in the 19% to 20% range. It's tough to call at this stage, right? But long-term, no doubt about it, we see our way to 20% on a sustainable basis.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then could you comment on the promotional environment there and if that had any impacts on second quarter margin? Was there more discounting or promotional activity year-over-year?","Patrick Grismer","That was not a big factor in our margin performance in the second quarter.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more on the same topic, and then I'll let somebody else go. So is the pricing now -- you mentioned 3% to 4% pricing. Is the pricing up about 6% or so year-over-year? And when do we roll over or lap some additional pricing? I think there might have been something in September of last year, if I'm not mistaken.","Patrick Grismer","That's correct. Current pricings, including our most recent actions, is on the order of 7%. There were 2 separate actions taken in the fall of last year, one in September, one in November. So those will roll off as we approach the fourth quarter.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. How much for those? Can you share that?","Patrick Grismer","2%.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","2% each [indiscernible]?","Patrick Grismer","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just first following up on that, if pricing is 7%, at least going into the third quarter, are you assuming traffic is positive in the mid-single-digit mix? Or is that not part of that assumption?","Patrick Grismer","With respect to transactions, given that we are lapping extraordinary traffic growth in the back half of last year, I would say that the traffic growth will be flat to slightly positive. But that is effectively working in our guidance for now back half of year of mid-single-digits same-store sales growth.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Appreciate the clarification. And can you just help us decompose the labor deleverage this quarter? Because wage inflation was less than quarter, and I know you called out some specifics around both the 24-hour initiative, delivery, as well as the new stores. Is there a way to tease out how much of that is from each of those components? And how much of it is one-time and contained in this quarter? And how much is expected be an ongoing phenomena because those initiatives continue?","Patrick Grismer","And John, we normally wouldn't going into that level of detail here. And clearly, it was a contributor to the margin decline in a year-over-year basis. The good news is that we're making this investment to grow these strategic sales layers. So as we roll out more 24-hour operations, as we roll out more delivery in KFC, yes, there's an upfront investment. It's slightly dilutive to our margins. But the important thing is that we're creating the platform for future growth. And also I'm sorry, John, just one last point. As you think about the impact of labor, of course the other big one, which we mentioned on the call, is what happens when you ramp up new unit development. And to the point Rick made before, when you move from a run rate of 500 to 600 new restaurants a year to something north of 700, you have to make an investment in operating capability. And that's been one of the keys to our success in China is that we don't grow ahead of capability. We build the capability first, and then we open the restaurants. And that, what that requires is an investment in restaurant labor so that we have the pipeline of RGMs fully qualified, ready to run these restaurants to our standards.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","What is your -- just last question. What is your expectation of Little Sheep dilution to margin for the full year in China? And I presume that your guidance of 19% to 20% excludes that.","Patrick Grismer","That is correct. And thank you for clarifying that. So our guidance on margin excludes the impact of Little Sheep. As we mentioned in the earnings release for the quarter, Little Sheep diluted margins by 0.3%. On a full year basis, in fact it will probably be a bit more than that. I mentioned in my remarks that the impact in Q3 alone could be up to a full percentage point. As to the impact to overall profits, at this stage, we would say that it will have a negligible impact.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.","Andrew M. Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick updates on some bigger-picture issues. First on FX for the year, just given the dollars spent. And then secondly, with the terrific results out of Taco Bell and the margin numbers, is that -- your refranchising, I guess, is that still moving forward? Or is there some thought maybe you want to keep some more of those assets, given the improved performance?","Patrick Grismer","I'll take those questions in turn. First on foreign exchange. Reflecting back on what we guided in New York, you may recall that at that time, certainly as I think everybody appreciates, given how volatile the global markets had been, it's really tough to forecast these things. I wish I had that kind of forecasting precision. But back in New York, we said that we expected for the full year China to deliver a $40 million ForEx benefit and YRI to present a $10 million ForEx exposure, so a net of $30 million. Based on what we've experienced halfway through the year and we're currently projecting based on forward rates, China, we believe, is going to deliver a benefit of $25 million, so that's down from the $40 million. And YRI, because of what you just mentioned, the situation with the dollar, YRI will present an exposure of $20 million, so a net of only plus $5 million. So we've gone from plus $30 million to plus $5 million. That is working in our current guidance of at least 12% EPS growth. And secondly, on U.S. refranchising, Rick can comment.","Richard T. Carucci","Yes. No change in the plans. As sort of Pat mentioned, the goal is still to have Taco Bell go from roughly 22% to 16% ownership. And we said we'd do that over a 2- to 3-year period. We're on track towards delivering that. We feel very good, as Pat sort of mentioned, that by the end of the year we'll meet the refranchising target for KFC. So we're making good progress along that front.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on China. First, I was wondering if you could maybe give us some perspective on what you're seeing in the consumer environment in general. Are you noticing any behavioral shifts or regional changes in demand? And maybe compare the slowdown that we're experiencing over there to what you've seen previously when the economy softened a bit.","Richard T. Carucci","Why don't I take that just from a historical context and Pat may want to add to it. Is that we always have a hard time in that part of the world, where when China slows down, they still have pretty strong GDP growth by our standards. But to your point that the consumers do get more cautious, so we are starting to see more sales at retailers in China. We probably expect that to continue as we go over time discounting. And we expect probably that could make it necessary to continue to provide the value that David talked about in terms of our approach to China. But the thing that's so -- if you look at consumers -- we do think they're going to get a bit more cautious. The biggest trends that we continue to see, and this was probably a bit magnified in the first part of this year, is Tier 1 cities are growing at a slower rate. And as you look at Tier 1 and Tier 2 and probably coastal cities, because exports appear to be slowing, they'll probably be hit harder. So one thing we feel fortunate about is the new unit development that Pat took us through, we're doing very well -- continue to do very well in Tier 3 through 6 cities. And those are generally performing at a higher rate. And right now, it's also higher same-store sales in those areas.","Patrick Grismer","David, the other thing I would add -- and I'm sure you read the same economic reports that we do. And of course, recently it was announced that GDP in China have slowed from 8.1% to 7.6%. But remarkably, consumer spending rose as a percentage of overall growth from what was 47% of GDP growth last year in the first half to 58% in the first half of this year. So broadly, the extent to which consumer spending is contributing to the growth of the economy is improving and certainly, that works in our favor.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess maybe one follow-up related to the step-up in unit growth. Could you maybe just talk about your confidence in ramping up the pace there? And maybe is some of the incremental openings really focused on those Tier 3 through 6 cities? Or is it more broad-based across the country?","Patrick Grismer","Well, as I said in my remarks, we have an extraordinary development team in China that numbers roughly 1,000 people. And that capability is unmatched and is a competitive advantage for us and gives us the ability to drive to a new level of unit development. And as I mentioned, one of the reasons why China G&A is up, I think it's 23% on the quarter, is in part because of the investment, the significant investment we're making in this growth capability. And that gives us a lot of confidence to sustain this high rate of new unit development. As to the distribution of these new units across tiers, over the last few years, and this will continue into the future, we're seeing more of a skewing of our development toward those lower-tiered cities, where we have unique presence and capability. And that works in our advantage, as I mentioned, from a margin perspective because it is in those lower-tier cities that we have more favorable cost structures that allow us to generate higher margins and better returns.","Operator","Next question is from Howard Penney with Hedgeye Management.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","I was wondering if you could articulate the thought behind the acceleration and growth in China. Back at the analyst meeting in New York, you sort of articulated the thought process that you would have incremental growth coming from other regions of the world to be able to hit 10%. So is the acceleration in China allowing you to complete that 10% growth rate? Or are there other macro factors or competitive factors that are leading you to accelerate the growth rate in China?","Richard T. Carucci","Well, just going back to December, I think that the biggest thing that occurred was the Chinese economic plan and the infrastructure development getting accelerated. And we talked about those cluster cities. And so a lot of new railroads, airports and then malls associated with those places have been sprouting up, and we've going in into those. And those are probably places that we didn't expect to have a couple of years ago. And then the other big part of the increase has just been, as David talked about, the great performance in Pizza Hut, and Pizza Hut also being able to be successful in the below Tier 2 cities. So those are the 2 biggest drivers that we're leveraging, and that's in -- as you know, if we went back 3 years ago, we wouldn't have anticipated that we would've hit these levels this quickly. And there was some teething pains associated with that from a profit standpoint, but we're obviously delighted that the number was able to reach what it reached so far. So we're not looking forward to accelerate beyond that.","Patrick Grismer","And Howard, just as a reminder, as we mentioned, when you look at our international development outside of China, so taking YRI and India together, we're now projecting gross builds of at least 1,000, which again is a record for Yum!.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","And still is the notion that there's an increased competitive presence in China not part of the process?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes. Well, I think that the competitive nature in China is definitely higher in the Tier 1 cities. In the rest of China, I think as I sort of said before or we said on different occasions, I think our competitive position has actually improved because we're getting more and more units into these smaller-tier cities before anybody -- national chains, Chinese or Western, are able to get there. So it's a different dynamic by location. So definitely to your point, Howard, I think the Tier 1 cities and even the Tier 2 cities are starting to get more competitive. But we really haven't seen that in the lower-tiered places.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","And will this make it harder for the competition to grow in those lower-tiered cities?","Richard T. Carucci","That's our hope.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Elliott with Raymond James.","Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'd like to move to the labor situation in China. Intrigued with the high rate of wage inflation, I'm wondering if that's doing anything to turnover. Are people being lured away to higher-paying jobs in other fields and turnover's rising, and so replacement and training costs are rising? Or are we able to sustain the historical turnover rates and just having to meet the market on wage increases for existing workers? And also whether it's more difficult to hire maybe potential managers in the high wage inflation environment?","David C. Novak","First of all, I think that the -- our ability to hire and retain talent in China is renowned. I mean, we have outstanding operating capability there. In fact, we've recently created what we call Whampoa. It's our training academy for the entire retail industry. Basically, we're bringing in management recruits out of college, telling them that within 4 years they can become a restaurant general manager, potentially a franchisee inside of our company. And if they want to move on and move into another industry, they can be well trained and perfectly prepared to go into retail, opening up many, many different careers. So we hired thousands of management recruits this past year and we think that our goal with operations is to have KFC be the operating mecca for talent not only for ourselves, but the rest of the industry. Just like, I think historically in marketing, P&G has been the marketing training ground for lots of talent. So we have -- today when you look at our RGMs, 90% of our RGMs are at least college graduates. And we see that number actually edging up over time. The quality of our jobs, the perception of our jobs is very, very high in China. Now consider this, these people are running $1.7 million businesses. They have up to 100 employees, okay? They have huge general manager responsibilities and they're being very competitively paid. And we have a culture that is, I think, very, very highly regarded and respected in the country. One of the things that's interesting, I was in -- I gave a speech in Shanghai at Fudan University. And they had 300 seats. There were 600 people in the auditorium. They were literally packing the aisles and almost sitting on top of each other. And the dean of the business school asked, \"How many of you have been to KFC or a Pizza Hut in the last week, okay?\" Everybody raised their hand. And our ability to build great brands is very highly respected in China, and so we think -- the thing that I'm most pleased about is that we continue to build operating capability. It's that operating capability that's allowing us to open up all the restaurants and continue to get the great return. So I think the ability to attract and retain talent is probably -- well, we've voiced out our operations was our the biggest competitive advantage and I think it is today, that along with the local team that understands how to really build brands. But the operating capability is something we're very confident and we will never ever take our eyes off of it because we know that people capabilities is the key to getting great returns for the long term.","Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","How about on the hourly side, crew side?","David C. Novak","We're not seeing any real impact, one way or the other on turnover.","Patrick Grismer","And just to build on that, Brian, one of the things that we -- we think our best part-time laborers in China are college students, and the percentage of college students have actually been rising over time.","David C. Novak","I think over 50% now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Siegner with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Goes out to either Pat or Rick. Just one last thing on China margins, just to maybe ask it at a slightly different way. You answered one of the questions or saying maybe one of the things that you missed were inefficiencies of accelerating the pace of unit openings. So just at the highest level, and maybe for 2Q and the full year 2012, what is the basis point impact on China restaurant level margins from that acceleration of unit growth? Like what was the drag on 2Q? And what do you anticipate the full 2012 drag to be from that acceleration?","Patrick Grismer","Yes. Keith, it was about 1 point in the quarter, and that's what we're expecting for the year.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Even though fourth quarter, you'll start to lap against a really accelerated pace of unit openings last year. I would think the pressure might get a little easier as the year progresses.","Patrick Grismer","I'm not calling it on the quarter in terms of our outlook. But in Q2, the impact was about 1 point. And as we look at the year, we would say it's about 1 point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research.","Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","On China first, regarding labor, should we just continue -- should we continue to expect double-digit wage rate growth for the foreseeable future?","Patrick Grismer","Yes.","Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And just a couple of other questions, most of my China questions have been answered. In the U.S., I think you mentioned modest third quarter profit growth. Can you discuss that? Does it have to do with any change in the top line trend? Or is it more on the cost side? If you can explain that, given a great profit growth quarter in the second quarter.","Richard T. Carucci","Just let me clarify. I was answering a question, I thought, about sales growth, so what I sort of said -- they asked about the environment for sales, and we just sort of said we expect positive sales for the KFC and Pizza Hut brands combined for the balance of the year, that we didn't think the environment is going to cause anything out there. I don't think we gave a profit outlook by quarter.","Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I thought in the prepared remarks, it was talking about modest profit growth in the U.S. in the third quarter. Did I misread that?","Patrick Grismer","Yes, that is correct. But when we look at the full back half of the year, given the headwind we're facing with the lap of the 53rd week, we wouldn't say that it's modest for the back half. It's more of a third quarter phenomenon as we expect that the sales growth will temper a bit from what we've seen in the first half of the year, low single-digits.","Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And on YRI, in the press release, it mentioned that emerging market comps were up over 9 -- about 9%, which sounds particularly strong. Can you give us a sense -- given that you have given guidance in the other regions, do you expect that emerging market comp growth to continue at a similar rate?","Patrick Grismer","Generally, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It sounds like the China topic has been exhausted, so I wanted to ask about YRI and the sort of the company margins expectation for improved performance in the back half. I know you talked about more moderate G&A growth and accelerated net unit development. And I can see why that should support faster growth. But can you just talk a little bit about what exactly went on with the restaurant margins? And is the expectation that things get better, does that embed the fact that the refranchising the U.K. business would automatically just give you back, I think, 200 basis points to margins?","Patrick Grismer","Yes. Sara, first to clarify, our forecast of improved margins for YRI in the back half of the year does not assume the benefit of the Pizza Hut U.K. refranchising. When we complete that transaction, as you mentioned, we expect about a 200 basis point improvement to YRI's margins overall. As to why we believe the situation is going to improve, it's important to recognize that in the second quarter, a key contributor to the decline was that we had a spike, a temporary spike in costs in Thailand at a time we were lapping quite extraordinary margins on Thailand. Thailand margins overall are very good, but it just so happens that given the timing of certain expenses including an increase in some wage rates that we took more of a hit in the second quarter. We see the situation for YRI overall in the back half of the year moderating where there's less pressure from unusual cost increases like this. That, combined with ongoing momentum in our productivity initiatives and what we expect we will see from same-store sales leverage, leads us to have confidence that we'll see an improved margin performance from YRI in the back half of the year.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","David, you said something interesting in an answer to your question about a manager potentially becoming a franchisee in China. I mean could you, I mean, elaborate a little bit that on what you meant? And secondly on a completely different direction, the credit markets seem to be in very, very good shape for a company like yours. And your debt to EBITDA and debt to free cash flow are at levels that probably people couldn't have imagined 10 years ago. So kind of looking at opportunities that may be presenting themselves, you have your new CFO, maybe have some different ideas in terms of what the capital structure could be, to what extent could you use the debt side of the balance sheet to enhance equity returns?","David C. Novak","Let me talk about first about the China franchise -- well first of all, in China, we are and will continue be predominantly company-owned. However, we are doing franchising on a limited basis and we're doing it more on a single-store owner basis, and we've been -- one of the things that we've been experimenting with and executing to a certain extent is taking great restaurant operators in our company and giving them the opportunity to run restaurants in China. So we think that, that will continue to be the case as we get bigger and bigger and bigger, especially across the number of different concept areas that we're in. And I'll turn to my new CFO to give you some perspective on our capital structure.","Patrick Grismer","And as to our capital structure, I would say that we're happy with where we're at now and how we've managed it over time because we've gotten extraordinary results. We continue to take a look at what's happening in the market and what might make sense for us and for our shareholders. And so we'll continue to do that and apply the same good discipline we have for the last several years. So no changes anticipated at this stage, but we do continue to look at it.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And if I may ask a question, like why wouldn't there be more debt on -- I mean, just asking a little bit, being more directly, why wouldn't there be more debt on your balance sheet at this point?","Tim Jerzyk","John, you've got to keep in mind, we talked about this. You've got to keep in mind everyday when we're building basically 2 new stores a day in China, most of them -- virtually all of them are leased. So we're adding leverage to our balance sheet in the minds of the rating agencies every day. So you got to keep -- they look at it from the full perspective, they capitalize the leases. So when you look at that, you've got to keep that in mind even though the balance sheet debt may look low, they definitely take that into account. And as we said previously, we had -- we were BBB- .And I think we're still BBB- with one of the agencies. We want to be BBB solid after the financial crisis. We felt like having another little bit more margin of safety was important. And that's basically where we are kind of but we're not quite yet with all 3 of them. So as much as some people would like us to add debt, we feel good about where we are, given what we've learned over the last few years, as Pat said.","David C. Novak","I think the important point here that you bring up, which we take a great deal of pride in, is that we are a dramatically different company, as you point out, than we were 10 years ago and that we have the ability to invest tremendously behind the core growth of our business, which is our #1 priority. We are able to buy back stock and we're able to pay a good dividend. And our ability to do all 3 of those things has only gotten better. And I think that's what I think is exciting as we think about the tremendous growth prospects we have ahead.","Okay. With that, I'd like to wrap it up, thank all of you for being on the call. As I said before, and I think it's a good summary of where we've been. The Yum! business is in very good shape, and we look forward to a solid second half and a full year EPS growth of at least 12%.

As such, we are maintaining our 2017 full-year guidance.","Before I review our key growth drivers, I want to note that our core operating profit growth for the second quarter in our KFC Division benefited from several items outside of our normal run rate, which David will discuss in more detail next.","Now to our four key growth drivers, which are at the forefront of every decision at Yum! I will talk to you about unrivaled culture and talent and our distinctive relevant brand. Then David will discuss unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development.","First, unrivaled culture and talent, Yum!'s greatest asset for driving results. This year, I'm continuing my commitment to championing our culture and talent not only with our own employees but also throughout the franchise system. I strongly believe that leading and investing in our culture is the best way to fuel better business result and I'm excited to see our franchisees embracing these ideas and learning to grow our iconic brand. I can tell you that our people and our franchisees are energized, our transformation agenda is taking hold, and our culture is stronger than ever.","Next, let's talk about how this culture is fueling results in our three distinctive relevant brands, starting with KFC, which is truly a global powerhouse. The brand continues to be Yum!'s most consistent, largest and fastest growing concept with a presence across 129 countries, providing the scale and diversification for a powerful business model. Representing approximately 50% of Yum!'s operating profit, KFC has nearly 21,000 units across the globe. During the second quarter, system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new development of 4%.","We are proud to highlight that in 18 of our 20 KFC business units across both emerging and developed countries, KFC reported positive same-store system sales this quarter. In the U.S. the second quarter represented KFC's 12th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth at a healthy 2%, or 4% on a two-year stack. The $5 Individual Fill Up and $20 Family Fill Up are at price points that resonate with the consumers and leverage the core menu of finger lickin' good chicken and sides.","The team has truly embraced the idea of moving from food as fuel to food as an experience. Just look at the Colonel drive-thru robot, the online retail store and the proof that KFC is literally out of this world. Who else has sent a sandwich into space?","As further proof KFC is back atop the cultural conversation, the online retail store, KFC Ltd., was mentioned in media spanning from the Huffington Post to Golf Digest. At the end of launch day, 18 of 29 products had sold out. The standout item was a $20,000 400-year-old meteorite in the shape of a Zinger chicken sandwich, selling within 24 hours with several other interested buyers as the sale was pending. These are truly remarkable events and something no one would have believed possible three years ago.","Our KFC international markets, representing nearly 90% of KFC's profits, also performed well, in particular, our Turkey and Australia markets. In fact, our Australia market delivered 7% same-store sales growth, driven by the launch of frozen beverages and a strong value, such as the $2.50 chips and gravy and 24 nuggets for $10.","Our Turkey market delivered same-store sales growth of 23%, driven by balancing the promotional mix between high-end bucket promotions and low-end offerings along with LTOs, which attracted new customers and grew transaction. The market is also seeing growth in their delivery business, which grew nearly 35% over the prior year and now represents approximately 30% of sales. Delivery remains a key growth driver for KFC with $1 billion of sales for the brand as of today and the opportunity to significantly increase this, as additional units and markets begin to offer delivery.","Our largest franchisee, Yum China, acquired a majority stake in an online aggregator platform complementing their already robust delivery business and is an example of one of our markets with a longstanding history of delivery. In addition, we have new markets testing with both online aggregators and in-house delivery all over the world. In fact, across the entire Yum! system nearly 20,000 of our restaurants offer delivery which is almost half of our total restaurant. Delivery offers consumers a new occasion at typically higher check averages and by leveraging the power of Yum! to create repeatable models amongst the markets, this makes delivery a platform with huge growth potential.","Next, to Pizza Hut, which as we have discussed is a tale of two businesses. First, the U.S. business, which represents approximately 10% of Yum!'s operating profit signed the Transformation Agreement in May, demonstrating unity amongst the system and our commitment to a digital delivery centric model. As a reminder, in return for additional media spend and funding from Yum!'s, the franchisees have committed to honor all-advertised national price points through 2019 and to permanently increase their ongoing contribution to national advertising and digital fees. An additional benefit of the increased advertising is that the funds will be used towards national advertising, allowing the brand to increase its share of voice as it works to build awareness of its efforts around digital and delivery.","The brand remains on track to effectively be on one point-of-sale system by the end of the year which will allow Pizza Hut to drive efficiency in its ability to improve its operations around delivery and speed-to-market on digital implementation.","As an example, this week, Pizza Hut announced the launch of their first ever U.S. loyalty program, Hut Rewards. This program is the only national pizza loyalty program that rewards online guests with points for every dollar spent on food. And as further proof that the brand is working to elevate their delivery-centric strategy, they recently announced the hiring of 14,000 drivers by year-end 2017. While we do not expect the Transformation Agreement to yield results overnight, we do expect to see improvement over time. In summary, I'm confident these bold steps will pay big dividends for the Pizza Hut brand over the long-term.","Internationally, Pizza Hut system sales increased 7% with 1% same-store sales growth and 5% net new development. We recently met with 10 of our top global Pizza Hut franchise organizations at our Partner's Council to gain delivery and digital-centric alignment to accelerate growth for the business. This group of influential individuals represents some of our largest international markets and over one-third of our total net new units currently committed under development agreements over the next three years. I am encouraged by the excitement these growth-minded leaders have for Pizza Hut, carrying an enthusiasm for the brand we haven't seen in a long time.","In addition to this, our UK business recently rolled out Pizza Hut Digital Ventures, an in-house model for digital technology that allows for consumer-led and fast-paced decisions. Through continued testing and real-time iterating, Pizza Hut Digital Ventures is transforming the Pizza Hut UK website into an easier, faster and better experience for our customers. Thanks to this agile capability and the improved site functionality, we are seeing increased conversion rates, which drive digital sales growth.","Finally, the repeatable model for value and taste we have previously discussed is lapping its successful rollout and the sales turnaround we saw in key countries like Malaysia and Korea continued in Q2. All in, the international team is hard at work and we are excited about these results and the long-term growth prospects for Pizza Hut.","Finally, Taco Bell, which represents approximately 30% of Yum!'s operating profit, posted another strong quarter of same-store sales growth coming in at 4% with 1% of that coming from transaction growth. We remain confident in delivering another strong year of results by committing to the strategy, encompassing value and innovation with Mexican-inspired product such as the $1.49 Loaded Taco Burrito you saw this quarter. As I alluded to during the prior quarter, we introduced an additional Naked product with the Naked Chicken Chips, a creative twist allowing us to expand on our chicken platform.","I know the Taco Bell team enjoyed meeting everyone and highlighting their growth story at the Analyst Day in May and I hope you appreciated hearing their story and got a good taste of their world-class products and innovation. As further evidence that Taco Bell continues to be a distinctive and relevant brand, news from Taco Bell saying, \"I do,\" to weddings at the Las Vegas store appeared in top tier national food and lifestyle outlets. Since the initial wedding announcement in February, coverage of this campaign has created 1.7 billion impressions for the brand. Our customers now have a new and unique way to show their love for each other and this iconic brand.","Additionally, last week, Taco Bell announced a partnership with Lyft to launch Taco Mode. For the first time, Lyft has created an integration within their app that enables consumers to ride through a Taco Bell on the way to their final destination. The ride is designed to be as much an experience as the end benefit of capping a night with Taco Bell cravings. This partnership highlights the forward thinking at Taco Bell to provide access to our customers in new ways enabled by technology. Weddings and Taco Mode are just a few examples of the cultivation of the brand into consumers' lifestyles.","Internationally, we also continue to accelerate our presence of Taco Bell. During the quarter, Taco Bell opened 15 international units in 7 countries. In particular, in our four key growth markets of Brazil, India, China and Canada, the team opened 6 units bringing our total unit count in those countries to 54. We are very excited to have opened our first standalone unit in Canada in nearly 20 years. This restaurant is hugely popular on social media with 98% positive sentiment and plans to start serving beer soon.","In India, the team has defined a category of one positioning by offering a differentiated customer experience through elevated assets, table service and unique product offerings like hard shakes that have unlocked opportunities for accelerated expansion of this brand in this huge potential market.","In summary, aligning Yum! by brands several years ago highlighted the potential for Taco Bell internationally. And as you can see, the team is working diligently to bring the cult of Taco Bell to everyone across the globe.","In conclusion, Yum!'s three distinctive relevant brands delivered another successful quarter. We are on track to further unlock the potential of Yum! through our bold transformation initiatives and look forward to updating you on our journey.","And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and CFO, David Gibbs.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results and full year outlook. I'll then provide an update on our transformation initiative and two of our key growth drivers: bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. I'll close with more detail on recent capital markets transaction.","Yum! delivered another successful quarter with 19% core operating profit growth and 21% EPS growth excluding Special Items, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. As Greg mentioned, our core operating profit growth for the second quarter included the benefit of approximately $9 million within our KFC Division as a result of several items outside of our normal run rate. Some of these items include higher renewal and transfer fees as well as lower closure and impairment fees. We do not expect these items to recur in the future.","As we expected, there will be noise on a quarterly basis as we continue to execute our transformation. This is why we continue to believe the best way to evaluate Yum! is to focus on 2019, our first clean year post-transformation and our target for $3.75 or more in EPS in 2019.","I am pleased we remain on track with this target as well as our other aspects of our transformation strategy including our goals of at least 98% franchise ownership, reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales and achieving run rate CapEx of $100 million in 2019. We are confident this transformation will allow Yum! Brands to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient, ultimately delivering more growth to you, our shareholders.","With respect to our guidance, the first half of the year saw a limited impact from net re-franchising dilution. However, for the full year, we now anticipate the net impact from re-franchising dilution to be towards the high end of the 1 percentage point to 2 percentage point range we previously discussed. Combined with the lap of 2016's 53rd week, these two items are the drivers of the difference between our underlying base operating profit growth trend of high-single digits and 2017 guidance of mid-single digit core operating profit growth. As Greg said, the underlying base rate of growth in our business both in terms of sales trends and profit contribution are tracking in line with our plans and longer-term goals.","As such, we remain on track to deliver at least 5% system sales growth this year versus our 2016 system sales growth of 4% excluding the 53rd-week impact. The 2017 system sales growth guidance includes 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points of same-store sales growth and approximately 3% net new unit development.","Specific to the fourth quarter, we would note that in aggregate, we anticipate the net impact of refranchising dilution and the impact from lapping the 53rd week to be approximately a 10 percentage point to 12 percentage point headwind before any underlying core operating profit growth.","Regarding the Pizza Hut U.S. Transformation Agreement this quarter, Yum! incurred $12 million of costs primarily related to digital investments which were recorded as a Special Item. As a reminder, $37.5 million of incremental media spend related to the Transformation Agreement will be reflected in our core operating profit. $25 million of this will be expensed in the third and fourth quarters this year and has already been incorporated into our full-year guidance. The remaining $12.5 million is expected to be expensed in 2018.","Next, our transformation initiatives, including reduced G&A, refranchising, capital returns, and increased leverage are all on target for completion. G&A excluding Special Items as a percent of system sales was 2.0% this quarter. And we remain comfortable with our target of 1.7% by 2019.","With regards to refranchising, during the quarter we sold 244 units, including 40 KFCs, 163 Pizza Huts, and 41 Taco Bells, finishing the quarter at 94% franchised on our way to becoming at least 98% franchised by year-end 2018 with the majority of the refranchising expected to be completed in 2017.","Gross refranchising proceeds totaled $136 million this quarter and $320 million year-to-date. As part of our refranchising commitment, we continue to expect $2 billion in post-tax proceeds.","As I mentioned on our last call, we continue to aggressively leverage our renewed focus on bold restaurant development by attaching development agreements to our refranchising deals. This will enable us to elevate Yum!'s historical new unit development run rate to one that will help us achieve our goal of 7% system sales growth over the long term.","To highlight our bold restaurant development, we opened 487 gross new units and 174 net new units this quarter for net new unit growth of 3%. I'm especially proud of our Taco Bell Brazil market, where they opened 15 Taco Bells in nine months. Demonstrating the flexibility of the asset types, one of the Brazil units is 38 square meters or about 400 square feet and is on track to generate average annual unit volume over $1 million.","Entering new markets presents its own challenges. However, the Brazil market has embraced this challenge with success by thinking creatively about solutions to supply chain and unit economic obstacle. Frankly, this may be the most successful early entrance of a new brand into a new market that I've seen during my career here at Yum!, reflective of our new mindset to unlock growth.","As another example of bold restaurant development, our KFC U.S. business continues to update their assets to the American Showman design imaged through their remodels and new restaurants. The remodel is affordable with an average sales increase of mid to high-single digits. And both the design and results to-date have been well received by our franchisees, customers and teams. To-date, KFC U.S. has over 500 American Showman restaurants, representing over 10% of their assets. And we are excited about the potential overall market impact.","Unmatched franchise operating capability has always been of utmost importance. And I'm excited to see the progress we are making. For example, at Taco Bell an operational speed initiative improved drive-thru wait times by 10 seconds in the quarter. In addition, Pizza Hut UAE made significant improvement in their online overall satisfaction scores, which are now approximately 25 percentage points higher than the 2016 scores. This is driven by speed initiatives, promised time improvements and a restaurant engagement strategy focused on bettering the underperforming restaurant.","We discussed Pizza Hut Korea on our last earnings call. And I'm pleased the market is continuing to see improvements in their overall satisfaction scores, driven by improving speed and taste scores.","At the Pizza Hut Partners Council that Greg and I attended, one of the partners in attendance was our new franchisee in Japan, who is working with his management team and employees to implement growth strategies, improve the value of Pizza Hut and bring capital and a commitment to growing the brand.","Additionally, we met the new Taco Bell franchisee in Brazil this quarter, who has opened the 15 restaurants in nine months, which I previously mentioned. This franchisee is an example of how to develop the brand in the right way, investing in people and world-class assets to bring the cult of Taco Bell to an entirely new population.","In total, Taco Bell added 12 new franchisees over the last 12 months. Six of these are domestic with the brand strength in the U.S. allowing us to be highly selective when adding new franchisees, ensuring they have extensive operations experience, a deep understanding of their markets and the desire for meaningful development.","We are also pleased to continue returning capital to our shareholders, including repurchasing 5.6 million shares this quarter at an average price of $68 for a total of $384 million. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share for $105 million, bringing our total capital return to $489 million this quarter and over $1 billion year-to-date. As a reminder, we plan to return between $6.5 billion and $7 billion from 2017 to 2019.","I'm also excited to share some good news regarding the financial markets' continued support of our business transformation and capital market strategy. First, in June we re-priced our term loan A and revolving credit facility, reducing the interest rate by 75 basis points to adjusted LIBOR of plus 1.5% and extending the maturity to 2022. This will reduce our annual cash interest by approximately $6 million with approximately a $1 million benefit in 2017, net of fees and other expenses.","Second, consistent with our stated intention to maintain a targeted leverage ratio of about 5 times and in anticipation of a $325 million bond maturity due in March 2018, we executed a $750 million 10-year bond offering with a coupon rate of 4.75%. The deal was multiple times oversubscribed and was one of the lowest rates in high yield in any sector in the last four years. Our total debt outstanding is now $9.8 billion. Our current average interest rate is now 4.5%, and the average maturity is seven years. Additionally, approximately 90% of our total debt is at fixed rate.","In conclusion, we have built upon our first quarter results with a successful second quarter. We are pleased to be on track with our 2017 guidance and our Strategic Transformation Initiative. Our four key growth drivers: distinctive relevant brands, unmatched franchise operating capability, bold restaurant development and unrivaled culture and talent allow us to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient. In the end, this will deliver strong, steady growth and we look forward to updating you along the way.","And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open.","Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Lots of exciting developments at Pizza Hut, clearly, lots of good color there. But as far as key priorities go, maybe you could just talk a little bit more about the technology, the operations, and the asset pieces, what you kind of see as the easiest to address, where the biggest opportunities lie. And then just building on that, on the asset piece specifically, any additional color you can provide on the Pizza Hut Delco units? I think it's probably about 20 that you've got open at this point only. But anything more on the economics, the feedback, et cetera? Thank you.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, I'll start with the piece on the assets. I think you're referring to the Fast Casual Delco model that we've been rolling out over the last few years... with pretty good success.","Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Yes.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","The good news is that we have offered an incentive for our franchisees to accelerate the Fast Casual Delco model and we've seen a number of franchisees sign up. In fact, we were hit with 100 submissions to participate in expanding the test. So I think the Fast Casual Delco initiative is off to a good start. That's not just an initiative, by the way, that we're doing in the United States, that is also a big part of our international growth strategy.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. We actually shared that with the International Partners Council when we were with them in London probably three weeks ago, and I think there was true excitement about Fast Casual Delco as a global opportunity for Pizza Hut.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. And then on the other items that you asked about, Dennis, like technology, assets, operations, obviously all very critical, all part of the overall Transformation Agreement with the U.S. franchisees. As one piece of evidence of the progress we're making on technology, you heard Greg reference the loyalty program that we just launched. You can expect to see those kinds of improvements to our technology platforms coming out but obviously we are not going to share much in advance of revealing them to the consumers.","And then on the operations front, I know the team \u2013 you've also seen our messaging start to reference hot and fresh, and the way that we're going to make sure that our consumers get the absolute best product. We know we have the best product in the category when we deliver it hot and fresh. We're doubling down and making sure that we have the capability with drivers and equipment to make that happen on a consistent basis.","Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. My first question just has to do with your system sales goal of 7%. You got close to or closer to it this quarter. And if you look at just the sum of comps and units, it's actually 5%, maybe that's rounding. But is there a new store productivity story here either in the new stores you're opening by brand around the world or market mixes that may actually help you get to the system sales goal even if the sum total of the two growth numbers that we add up typically don't add up to 7%?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","It's a good question, John. I wouldn't read too much into it. For example, the same-store sales growth for the quarter of 2% was a very strong 2%. So there is some rounding that's happening there and a little bit of mix issues, a little bit of timing of when new units open. So when you put it all together, yes, it rounded up, and we like that but there's a number of different miscellaneous factors that contributed to it.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I think there's also, as we have been \u2013 David and I've been around, and I've been in Brazil, UK, Poland, Japan, Hong Kong in the last quarter. I think it's a couple of things. One is the small box concept is definitely taking \u2013 getting traction, and that small box is allowing us to penetrate places like in Africa, into places we would not have been able to traditionally penetrate with our existing sort of asset base. And then, I think, Cantina \u2013 I was up in Chicago the other day, one of our franchisees in Chicago. He has one opened in Wicker Park and he showed me where he's going to open another four or five. There's no trade-off with any of our existing Taco Bell stuff. So I think the whole opportunity for us to get into small box Cantinas, urbanizes the brand will help us drive net new units.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Could I just follow up with a question on Pizza Hut loyalty program? What is \u2013 do you have loyalty anywhere else in the world? Is there a model you're following or is this the first one? And are there models out there that do transaction driving loyalty and others that do ticket driving loyalty? What kind of program is this? Does it require the app to use? Or can anyone use it? How widespread do you think the use is and how do you think it impacts sales ticket versus transactions, for example?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Just on the prevalence of programs in our system, yes, we do have loyalty programs and we have some in parts of Asia that are executed quite well and a big part of driving the business. So we've certainly gone to school on our \u2013 within our own system on leveraging learnings. We actually engaged an outside party also to help us understand the loyalty landscape. In a lot of cases, being the last to the party on loyalty in the pizza category is a good thing because we get to offer the best program and learn from the experiences of others.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. I have a question on the franchise revenue versus the franchise expense. As we would expect, as you sell off the restaurants, your franchise revenue is going up. But when we exclude the Pizza Hut transformation expense, it looks like the franchise expenses are actually dropping. Was that $9 million favorability reference in KFC in that line item there or are you just finding more favorability in franchise expense in addition to the ongoing G&A reductions?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I think that there's mostly some timing issues that would contribute to that. The $9 million that \u2013 we called out the $9 million on the KFC line just because KFC had a very strong quarter this year and I wanted to make sure everybody understood that a small portion of it was more one-time related to U.S. fees that we collected earlier than normal that contributed to an outsized quarter when it came to U.S. fee \u2013 U.S. KFC franchisee fee income. That was close to $6 million. But I wouldn't read too much into the second part of your question.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And on the CapEx for the year, you're running well below the $300 million to $350 million that you had discussed earlier in the year and you're obviously doing more refranchising in the back half. Is this kind of the run rate we should expect for the rest of the year? Do you have a, I guess, corporate capital plan that will require you to have a step up in CapEx in the back half?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I don't think we're going to \u2013 we're not revising our guidance on CapEx spending. Obviously, we're laser-focused on getting the overall rate down to $100 million by 2019. In terms of how the spending is going this year, it's sort of in line with the targeted number. Maybe there's a little upside there, but I wouldn't read too much into that either.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Greg. As part of the 7% system-wide sales growth longer term, there's meant to be a step up in unit development, which I think is 4% to 5% longer term. So could you put the current 3% into the context of that 4% to 5%? Do you see a step up by brand in 2018 or 2019 in terms of new units? Or, I guess, just as important for other size? Or do you think we're going to see a particular slowing in... (33:27 \u2013 33:31)","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Sorry, your questions \u2013 you're breaking up. We cannot get the question.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I don't know if we lost him or not, but John, just to address the point you made on unit development, we haven't released any specific targets for unit development. So you referenced 4% to 5%. Certainly, we'd like to get to levels like that but we've been focused on the overall mission of getting to 7% in system sales growth over the long term. A big part of that will be increasing our development because we know when we plant that development pipeline over the long term we can count on it to deliver that growth every single year. Yeah, so and you should be looking for us to continue to be ramping up development in the years to come, but we haven't released any future guidance on that.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And my apologies for the transcript. I think I just assumed 2% to 3% comp and the rest from unit development. But can I ask if the connection is better right now? Do you see step-ups in 2018 or 2019 either in terms of new unit openings or in closures? And if you could just give us a little more color or confidence that even if we think about 2018, you could get better net results than 2017?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I think one of the features of the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement is actually a limitation on the U.S. stores, making it harder to close stores in the U.S. So we should get a benefit from that in 2018 if you're thinking about broader issues that may be working in our favor.","But beyond that, I think we've said this on many calls, we got our management team together in the spring. The mission in this company has been to hammer home this focus on development. Bold restaurant development is one of our four key growth drivers. And I think we've seen a mindset shift all around the country, all around the world, that is really contributing to much more focus on development than we've ever had. Greg mentioned different formats. There's just a lot of good stuff going on in development. Now it takes time to plant a development pipeline and get it to grow, but we do expect to see an increase in development in 2018.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, if you think about it, we've been closing KFC U.S. stores for a number of years, for quite a number of years. Hopefully, with the now 12th consecutive quarter of performance at KFC, there will be some change there as well.","I think, as David said, the development agreements sort of go with refranchising. So as the refranchising occurs, the development agreements kick in. And then obviously these new units, small box new formats Cantinas, the 38-square-meter we saw in Brazil, I think all of these provide us opportunities to penetrate and continue to grow our net new unit.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I've got one more on the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement in the U.S. Can you guys provide at least some base level numbers for where the concept is right now in terms of things like delivery as a percent of sales mix or digital orders as a percent of sales mix? Just give us some context as to where you're beginning this journey. And it will make it easier for us to track the progress moving forward.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","We won't provide very specific numbers. But our digital mix is around 50%. Even though we have more than half of our stores in the U.S., our dine-in stores, our business is very heavily reliant on carryout and delivery. I don't know. Maybe 10% to 15% of sales are dine-in, and the rest of the sales, just in broad terms, are split between carryout and delivery.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Just to follow up on John's question on unit development, maybe just a qualitative answer on this would be helpful. You mentioned Brazil, you mentioned the stabilization of Pizza Hut U.S., but if you were to think about your global business and looking at your pipelines of franchisees and licensees, where do you anticipate the biggest wins from a development standpoint as you look out one and two years? And then also on delivery, globally you mentioned that that's going to be an important sales layer. I know you've talked about that in the past. How significant can that be? And when do you see wins from that accelerating? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, I think there's obvious markets like China where we'll continue to see a lot of new unit growth. I think as we said, Taco Bell focusing on four big markets, China, India, Brazil, and Canada. As we said, we've opened our first freestanding drive-thru in Canada, the second one is under construction. In that one market, we think we can open six or seven. We've got U.S. franchisees for Taco Bell now sort of doing development in Canada. They're now doing development in Korea.","So I think that where we've seen growth, which will be Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, we've got a lot of these locked into long-term development agreements.","As David and I said, we were with the Pizza Hut franchisees last week. Have a new franchisee for Pizza Hut in Japan. Very impressed that he has got a real growth mindset, and I think we can accelerate opportunities in Japan as well. So I see it on that side.","On delivery, as we said in the prepared remarks, about 20,000 restaurants currently deliver. Obviously mostly Pizza Huts, but a large number of KFCs and obviously Taco Bells as well. I do think that delivery is going to grow. We like the benefits of delivery, higher check, incrementality, new users, new occasions. And I think what we're doing right now is testing in a number of places just user aggregators, doing it ourselves.","But I think we all see really a lot of potential growth there. Encouraged by some of the tests that are going on, like a UK test for KFC, where we're actually doing a test with both aggregators and by ourselves. We're seeing good incrementality, good check growth. So I think even the KFC team believes that adding another $1 billion in sales in the next few years is not without its possibility.","And then, Taco Bell, obviously, where we are doing delivery with DoorDash, I think it's now in a 1000 restaurants and it can get bigger as well. So I think our brands are well established with 20,000 restaurants doing it. We have the expertise of Pizza Hut to help us. I think brands like KFC are ideally set up to be delivered with large buckets, $5 boxes, $10 chicken shares and $20 buckets. It's almost like the Colonel 60 years ago realized one day we'd be delivering this stuff.","So I think we're in a really good place to take advantage of it. We do think there's growth there for us, and to some extent we're actually \u2013 KFC China is hosting a delivery summit this month where everyone from around the world will be going to a delivery summit in China so we can learn best practice from them, but also share best practice that we are doing from around the world. So we are all in on delivery.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","And one other point on development, which I think Greg alluded to earlier but just to expand on. The KFC U.S. business for many years was a net closure of stores, north of 100 closures every year. The KFC U.S. team, given the strength in the underlying business now feels really confident that they can get themselves to be a net opener of stores and that could get to north of 100 openings per year. So you think about a 200-unit swing alone just in KFC U.S., that'll obviously take time to implement. That obviously would be one of the contributors to the increase in development.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right, thanks.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have just a couple of follow-up questions, if I may. The first is on again Pizza Hut, and I think, Greg, you said it wouldn't be kind of an immediate turnaround. Results won't show up overnight. But I think in the past we've seen that Pizza Hut can do things to drive sales in the short term in a pretty meaningful way, in particular around value messaging. So maybe you could just share a little bit about what you're doing in 3Q in terms of marketing and price points.","And a related question is what are you seeing in the demand environment in the U.S. and the competitive environment? I think we've heard a lot about heavy discounting by hamburger restaurants in particular. I was wondering if you're seeing that have an impact on any of your brands, KFC and Taco Bell still comping well, but maybe a little slower sequentially.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, I don't want to get into Q3 in the pizza category, given the competitive nature of it. I think what I can say is we've said it's a slow build. The incremental media didn't happen in the first half, it will happen in the second half. Obviously, we've just rolled out loyalty. So I think you will hopefully see a slow build, and we see the results obviously paying off in 2018 and beyond on Pizza Hut. From a demand environment point of view, I think the great thing about our category is or the great thing about food is you've got to eat it and I think there will be winners and losers.","I think the people that have the most distinct and relevant brands, the people that do the best job of executing operations, the people that open new units and the people who are driven by culture and talent and that's why they're the four things we are focused on because we believe by focusing on those four things we can be successful in both the U.S. and on the global scale. So that's, I think, sort of the way I see the market at the moment.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, no increased intensity around discounting or value?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","No. I think, I mean, value is always going to be important. So I don't see any renewed focus. I mean, if you think about it, the question is \u2013 I think we've got very good everyday value. At KFC, we have $5, $10, and $20, and that really does resonate. I think $7.99 at Pizza Hut, I think the $1 and the $5 boxes at Taco Bell. So what I like about the way we're set up is that we've got everyday great value. What we don't have to do is to get into this deep discounting and sort of cutting the price on core products which you never want to get into because one day you got to raise those prices.","So I really like the way the three brands have constructed their value equation in the marketplace. I think you see that it's working on the whole. And what I appreciate is the franchisees' commitments to staying on those price points so that our customers know day in and day out they can always get not just the best tasting food but the best value in the marketplace.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. You're seeing more Pizza Hut questions. Sort of going back to the initial reacceleration in comps in Taco Bell that has been really built for many years. That was kind of kicked off with the Doritos Locos pretty singularly iconic viral product. Do you think there's a similar opportunity at Pizza Hut to really kickstart things with the product or are you more focused on sort of fundamental building blocks around technology, digital, asset base, et cetera? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I think the answer to that it's like the answer is and. We've got to make it easier and better. We do believe we have the better pizza; we've got to continue to make sure that we deliver a better pizza in the marketplace. But better is also making sure that our piping hot pizza gets delivered to you on time and therefore obviously tastes better.","So I think the answer is, just like everything in life, we have to be easy and we have to be better. So we're working on the easy components whether that's all the technology, the digital play whether that's loyalty, and at the same time, we're obviously continuing to work on making sure we have the best pizza in the marketplace. And I think a combination of both of those will see us sort of build the Pizza Hut brand back into the brand we want it to be.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk about the 2019 target of at least $3.75 in EPS. I think the $3.75 is an attractive target on its own but the question I have is what's the key in your internal model to unlocking that wording of \"at least\" within that stated target? Is the achievement of your goal to get to 7% systemwide sales growth help you unlock that word \"at least\"? Or is there something else that we should be focusing on?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","No. I mean, as we've said in past calls, we built the model on reasonable assumptions. We don't have to be heroes to get to that number. So the kinds of things that would contribute to outperformance would be an acceleration of system sales growth, a turnaround in the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We're not counting on any of those things to get there. So the \"at least\" is only there to indicate that we certainly have room to go beyond that if we see an acceleration in development, system sales growth beyond historical rates, Pizza Hut U.S. getting back to growth.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And just the follow-up question I have is on Taco Bell. It's a great comp for the quarter relative to the industry or any metric, really. The question I have is what were the biggest differences that you saw in the business and the growth of the business this quarter when analyzing the sales versus the 8% comp you achieved last quarter?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I mean, the way I look at Taco Bell is, we are just really enthusiastic about the long-term fundamentals of the business, whether it's the consumer metrics, the ops metrics, the financial metrics. Obviously, the brand has delivered consistent, healthy same-store sales growth over the long-term. And I think the icing on the cake, Dave and I happened to spend two days with the FRANMAC group, which is the franchise leadership group for Taco Bell in June, and I think to say they were happy with where the brand is, happy with where the brand is going and happy with the Taco Bell leadership team would be an understatement. So I just feel good about where the brand is going. What happens then quarter by quarter, I think, you will see us continue to deliver. The long-term fundamentals for this business are in great shape.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thanks, guys.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Operator, we'll take one more question, please?","Operator","Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Going back to your Investor Day, you guys set out plans to refranchise about 2,000 stores for at least $2 billion in proceeds. So it's about $1 million per store. Obviously with the 244 franchises in 2Q, you've looked at a gain on the sale, but the implied proceeds per store of $560,000 were a little lighter than the implied targets. Is the way to think about this is that it was driven, the lower proceeds per store, driven by an outsized amount of Pizza Huts that were franchised during the quarter?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes, absolutely. Pizza Huts obviously, with smaller investments in the smaller box units typically garner less proceeds, lower volumes versus, for example, our Taco Bells, which is our highest volume concept that we are selling stores of any scale on. So very much you will see that number move around from quarter to quarter, depending on the mix of the units.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Okay. Go ahead.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you. (49:22)","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Okay. So thank you all for being on the call.

","And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Greg Creed.","Greg Creed","Thank you Steve and good morning everyone. I'm pleased that you could all join on my first earnings call and I'm honored to share with you the opportunities ahead Yum! as well a review of our results. Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at the Investor Day in December. Our goal is to continue to build free global iconic brand that people trust and champion. I believe that's critical to delivering sustained growth and I'll share some views during my comments about 2015. ","But before I do, I'd like to comment on our 2014 results. As you saw in our release last evening, we grew full year EPS 4% in 2014, despite a 29% decline in the fourth quarter. These results were heavily skewed by the challenges handled in our biggest division, as we suffered two highly publicized supplier incidents in two consecutive years in China. However, we continue to believe this setback is temporary as evidenced by the bounce back we delivered in the first half of 2014 following the first supplier incident. As prudent of our convictions, we continue to invest what our belief is. We are building 700 new units in China this year because we absolutely believe that market offers strong unit economics and return on investment. Based on our expected recovery in China and the positive momentum across the rest of Yum!, we expect EPS growth of at least 10% in 2015. ","As outlined at our Investor Conference in New York, this will be a first half second half story with EPS growth negative in the first half of the year then turning strongly positive in the back half of the year. I'd like to reiterate that we are firmly committed to restoring our track record of at least 10% EPS growth and consistently achieving our division targets. So how are we going to do this? Well today I'd first like to update you on what's happening in China since we last met in December. I will then discuss what gives me confidence in the future for each of our business and after that Pat will walk you through the financials.","First China, following the successful menu revamp in 2014, China operating profit increased 116% in the first half of the year and Yum! EPS grew 27%. We were convinced that 2014 would be a year of at least 20% EPS growth. The Shanghai Husi supplier incident changed all of that. We know KFC and Pizza Hut are beloved brands in China with a huge advantage not just in scale but also innovation, quality and people capability, despite the recovery of KFC is not occurring at the pace we expected. The good news is that our consumer perception scores have shown continued improvement. Metrics at KFC including food safety scores and reliable brand scores have improved every month since their August lows. From what we can tell, the biggest setback to this recovery is that we incurred two supplier incidents in such a short timeframe. ","So what are we doing to address this? We've learnt from other setback that we must innovate our layout and that's what we're doing. We have two menu revamps scheduled this year one in the first half and one in the second half. This proves successful in the first half of 2014 and we'll leverage the success this year. And of course we'll continue to offer compelling value. We've also started our initial rollout of premium coffee in Shanghai KFC stores in December.","The initial results are encouraging and firstly ground copy has contributed probably to our breakfast and afternoon data. We expect this to add an incremental sales way that we can grow. By the end of February we have copy in more than a thousand of app stores and by the end of the year we anticipated we should have copy rolled out into over 2000 stores. This is a significant achievement and stepping a different way we'll have premium copy in more stores by the end of the year then Starbucks had total stores in China in 2014. I want to assure you it's my top priority and all hands are on deck to get the China business back on track as soon as possible. Prior to our investor meeting in December Joey Wat, our KFC China President spent several days in Irvine working with the Taco Bell team to learn more about Taco Bell innovation process mobile app and digital customer engagement. Jolly has taken those learning and is looking to improve KFC China in these areas. ","This is just one example of have we share now have and best practices from teams around the world as we address the set back with a sense of urgency. Now let's step back and look at where we are KFC China averaging volumes in 2014 where 1.35 million or 20% off at peak levels but despite these margins held at 15%. These fundamentals demonstrate we can still open stores with confidence offering attractive returns for our shareholders. We know still have work to do to regain our customers trust but once we do the opportunity are tremendous. Just recovering average unit volumes to 2012 levels to KFC will result in $1.7 billion incremental revenue and that doesn\u2019t even include the new units we\u2019re building. Pizza Hut Casual Dining is recovering more quickly the brand was not as severely impacted by the supplier event as KFC. Many consumer metrics are back to process where they were in the second quarter of 2014. And we introduced this to the fact of Pizza Hut has only been impacted by one supply instrument not two by no means are we out the woods but we are trending in the right direction. And we are continuing to build the brand by expanding style layers like breakfast in late night.","I want to assure you that we remain committed to new unit development and plan to open 700 new units in China in 2015 which builds under 737 we open in 2014. In addition to the massive new unit opportunities have been KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining, we continue to expand Pizza Hut Home Service as well. We have a tremendous sales leverage opportunity in China as sales recover and we fully expect to realize this overtime. There\u2019s a $600 million profit opportunity by simply returning our existing assets to the volumes we had in 2012. And I have great confidence in Sam Su, our Vice Chairman and China division CEO and his ability to get the China business back on track and capture this enormous upside. ","Now for the other two thirds of our business. First KFC, our KFC business model is incredibly strong I love the combination of being the emerging market leader being franchise led and having allotments like double digit operating growth well into the future. We expect to open 700 new international units in 2015 after a record year in 2014 of 666 new units. We're clearly entering the year with same stores sales momentum as comps grew 4% in our last quarter.","We saw continued excellent system sales right in Russia of nearly 40% and double digit growth in Africa and Thailand all in constant currency. The new use to KFC is our U.S businesses performing much better. U.S same stores sales grew 6% in the fourth quarter and the division is poised with best year in sometime. All of this sets the KFC division after a strong 2015 Micky Pant our KFC CEO is there is lot of credit leading this incredible brand and with this brand positioning is always original I am confident the best is yet to come. ","Now to Pizza Hut, we opened a record 465 new international units in 2014 and expect to improve on this number in 2015. Our focused brand structure is clearly paying dividends with Pizza Hut development. However, Pizza Hut\u2019s more than a new unit story as you all know Pizza Hut launch his new menu in the U.S driven by the flavor of new brand positioning in December. I would be remits if I didn\u2019t tell you sales were softer than we expected with our initial launch and I absolutely believe our product in brand positioning arrive but we struggle to get our communications balance to build the new brand positioning while still connecting with our core-customer. However, this is a long term strategic initiative, we are excited by the fact that the people who have tried it, love it. Repurchase in temp is greater than 90%. Look this is just a first innings we are working to drive more customer trial as a rapid pricing campaign evolved to drive self through shopper product and crossing office. And impressively, we've seen operational pick up from the new menu. I know new Pizza Hut CEO David Gibbs and his team our focus on getting the advertising and crossing right to ensure that their brand building efforts pay huge dividends. We also enhanced the Pizza Hut mobile app back in late November. Before the fourth quarter over 40% of delivering in carry out orders we're by digital. Over 50% of all digital orders are occurring through the app and mobile devices and digital sales grew 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. ","Just this pass through Sunday, we saw over $10 million worth of peaks of app digital devices. Mocking the single biggest digital day in Pizza Hut's history believe me we absolutely understand importance of digital to complete acceptably in the Pizza category and are making significant investment in these area of the business. There is no doubt in my mind that the Flavor of Now is instrumental to building a more relevant consumer proposition for Pizza Hut. We've a long runway ahead of us and we are making the necessary decisions to drive future return both domestically and globally. ","And finally, the Taco Bell. Taco Bell continues to fire on all cylinders. The breakfast launch last spring of the success and we continue to record strong margins. Breakfast was again 6% of the day part mix in the fourth quarter and we expect to further grow the layer with additional product innovation. I believe a lot of the momentum witnessed at Taco Bell is attributable towards inside driven brand positioning, product development, advertising and social engagement with core users. We are applying this to the other two brands and across the globe. And vice-versa, all ideas don\u2019t have to come from the U.S. or from Taco Bell. For example, we're taking a page from the success of our open-kitchen Taco Bell restaurant in Bangalore, India and I plan to open a similar restaurant in the U.S. in 2015. This sharing of ideas globally is especially important as we work to spread good ideas worldwide and across brand to make the brave decisions necessary to lead this food revolution. Our mobile app launch is also a solid start of Taco Bell. We've seen 2 million downloads so far. We expect 2015 to be another solid year as we focus on furthering our breakfast offerings, generating more innovation across all dayparts and optimizing our presence with next gen footprint.","I'm thrilled to have Brian Niccol leading this brand and taking it to the next level Live Mas positioning. The opportunity that lies ahead of Taco Bell is really unmatched as we start to expand internationally and who better to take the brand global than Yum! We have the infrastructure, supply chain, franchise relationships, fixed brand, this brand's domestic success on a global scale. As I see it, we are just in the early days of taking this brand to a new level. ","So in conclusion, we have an incredible growth opportunity ahead of us. Without a doubt, we are disappointed about the results out of China but we are addressing issue head-on and I believe the upside from this business is tremendous. Yum! is in a unique position. We have three iconic brands and I think we have an opportunity to make each of these brands stronger. My vision as CEO is to build three global iconic brands that people trust and champion. In order to do that, we have identified each brand's true known positioning that is a clear, compelling and relevant guidepost. As you saw at our New York Analyst Meeting each of the brand leaders is using these brand positioning and underlying principles to drive results through brands that are more relevant, more engaged, more connected and ultimately more caring. I believe this will overly translate to consistent results that will reward our shareholders. ","And for now it gives me much please to hand over to Pat to take you to thorough details on the financials. Over to you.","Pat Grismer","Thank you Greg and good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover three areas. Our fourth quarter results and our outlook for 2015 and our ownership strategy. For the fourth quarter EPS excluding special items declined 29%. Reported EPS was negative, primarily due to a non-cash special item charge of $361 million related to further impairment of Little Sheep assets in China which I'll cover in a minute. I'll start with a broader discussion of our China business and then move into our other divisions.","As we outlined at our December Investor Meeting, same store sales KFC China are recovering at a slower pace than we initially expected and declined 18% for the fourth quarter which for China division includes the last four months of the year. Same store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining were more in line with our original estimates and declined 9% for the fourth quarter. These sales declines weighed heavily on restaurant profitability particularly as the fourth quarter is the seasonal low point China's fiscal year yielding a restaurant margin of 7.1% for the quarter.","In addition to significant sales deleverage, we were also impacted by food inflation of 3% and labor inflation of 9% which combined had a negative 3% point impact to restaurant margin. While we're not pleased with these results, we expect the combination of sales improvement, modest pricing and responsible cost management to dramatically improve our China division's profitability as the year progresses with a particularly strong second half. ","Given our long-term positive outlook for China and our continued belief that the current sales issues are temporary, we opened 737 new restaurants in the world's fastest growing economy. We also continued our disciplined approach to development shifting our new unit program towards high return investments. As evidence of this, Pizza Hut Casual Dining still delivering 18% restaurant margin in a year when same store sales declined 5% comprised nearly 40% of our new unit openings in 2014. ","Now before moving to our other divisions, I want to provide some color on the impairment charge that we took in the quarter related to Little Sheep. Due to sustained same store sales declines, significant store closures and the evolution toward a more franchise led business we determined that it was appropriate to further write-down our investment in Little Sheep and therefore recorded a non-cash special item net charge of $361 million. We are extremely disappointed with the performance of Little Sheep since we acquired the business in 2012. It has clearly fallen well short of our expectations and hasn\u2019t yet achieved the unit level economics necessary to justify the expansion we had envisioned for this concept. We have a small dedicated team focused on improving this business and pending the outcome of these efforts will evaluate our options with Little Sheep later this year. ","Now moving to our global KFC division which posted its strongest quarter of the year with solid improvements in sales, margins and profit. Systems sales growth was especially strong in emerging market up 12% led by Russia, Africa and Thailand. International developed market also delivered solid systems sales growth up 5% led by the UK, Continental Europe and Australia and the U.S posted its strongest quarter of same stores sales growth in nine years of 6%. Operating profit grew an impressive 19% in the quarter before the impact of foreign currency translation this included a benefit of 3 percentage points from the favorable resolution of the pension matter in the UK. Importantly KFC stead a new record for international development in 2014 opening 666 new restaurants demonstrating the global power of this iconic brand.","Our global Pizza Hut division posted flat same stores sales growth for the quarter. Although this was the lower expectations it represented another sequential improvement in quarterly sales performance since the start of the year. Despite this improving sales trends operating profits decline 11% driven by 2.7 percentage point decrease in restaurant margin coupled with strategic investments in international G&A to lay the foundation for future growth. On the positive side the quarter capped a year of record level development for the Pizza Hut brand opening 465 new international units capitalizing on the continued strong growth of the Pizza delivery category globally. And finally Taco Bell which posted their best quarter of the year with operating profit growth of 20% global same stores sales grew 6% including 7% same stores sales growth in the U.S driven by breakfast the launch of our dollar credence menu in our recent Sony big box promotion. Restaurant margin improved 0.1 percentage point to 20.6% raising full year margin to approximately 19%.","Additionally, we opened 236 new stores this year our strongest weighted development in more than a decade. Almost 90% of these new restaurants were opened by franchisees further demonstrated the attractive investment returns to the Taco Bell brand generates. I know like to talk about our 2015 outlook we are full committed to delivering EPS growth of at least 10% this year. And consistent with the plans, we laid out in early December at our Investor Meeting we have a path to achieve this target without profit growth from our largest business KFC China. The pace of sales recovery in this business remains difficult to predict and we'll have much better visibility to this trajectory and the implications for KFC China's profit growth and young EPS growth as the year progresses. Along these lines, our path to at least 10% EPS growth has become tougher. The major change is foreign currency translation. We initially estimated exposure of at least 1 percentage point of EPS for the year but based on current spot rates and projections that could now be around 4 percentage points of full year EPS headwinds. To be clear this exposure is largely one of profit translation and does not impact our competitive position as it relates to how we place our products around the world. The vast majority of our input costs on a local currency where we operate so swings in foreign exchange rates have no real impact to our pricing or competitive value. ","With respect to China, Pizza Hut sales are about where we thought it is. But KFC continues to recover at a slower pace than we anticipated. Same stores sales for KFC did not improve in the month of December and January as we expected, as recent promotions were too narrowly focused from a consumer perspective. We've taken swift action to develop new advertising and new local store marketing programs to strengthen our overall promotions with broader appeal to our core-customers during the upcoming Chinese New Year period. We expect these actions will deliver improved results in the coming weeks. In spite of these headwinds, we remain committed to delivering at least 10% full year EPS growth for 2015 with the first half negative and the second half strongly positive just as we outlined in New York. However, based on current trends, we expect China same stores sales for the first quarter which is limited to the month of January and February will be in a negative mid-teen range. Combining these with our new expectations for foreign exchange we estimate that young EPS in the first quarter of 2015 will be about 20% lower than prior year. So with a weaker than expected start to the year why am I confident it will deliver at least 10% full year EPS growth for 2015. Here is the key reason number one, we expect China division to have a very strong second half bolstered by A the gift of time and the demonstrated resilience of our brand including the upward trend in our key consumer metrics. B two menu rebounds including new breakfast innovation and the continued roll out of premium coffee at KFC. C, two menu revamps and the expansion of our breakfast afternoon tea and late night programs at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. And D, new product and digital innovation at Pizza Hut Home Service. We are also continuing prudent new unit development of all three businesses, while making the investments necessary to contemporize our brands to keep pace with the changing China. We have enormous profit leverage in our China business, so when sales recovery as we expect they will, we are positioned to realize a significant uplift in division operating profit similar to what we achieved in the first half of 2014. In fact, as sales recover to 2012 levels, we believe there is $600 million of latent profit potential just with our current assets underground.","Number two, we expect positive momentum to sustain at both KFC and Taco Bell divisions which together account for about 55% of our global operating profit supported by more breakthrough product innovation, solid franchise driven at new unit pipeline plus the rollover benefit from last year's record development and continued progress on digital. ","Number three; we expect Pizza Hut division sales and profits to strengthen across the year as we accelerate the pace of international development particularly in emerging markets building on last year's record level additions which benefit this year. Improve the execution of our brand re-launch in the U.S. with more targeted product news, promotional offers and marketing communications continue to improve and expand our digital platforms and leverage our best product innovation ideas from around the world. ","Now I'd like to quickly cover our ownership strategy and how we make decisions where to invest equity. First from a global perspective, we lead with franchise development with our franchisees opening over 1,500 restaurants around the world including the vast majority of new units opened at our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell divisions. Second, we maintain purposeful equity investments on the basis of financial and strategic criteria. On the financial side, we own equity where we generally have high growth, strong returns and strong operating capability. On a strategic side, we have equity positions that allow us to innovate our concepts, build capability and lead the growth of our system. And third, we refranchise when we believe the franchise model creates more shareholder value. In fact after a conducting a comprehensive review of our equity business, we announced in December our intent to become even more franchised as a company. ","Currently, we are slightly more than 90% franchise outside of China and India and we're going to take that to approximately 95% franchised over the next three years. With this, we expect operating margin for these businesses to improve from 24% in 2014 to over 30% in 2017. For China and India, we realized there are opportunities to unlock shareholder value to refranchising as well. We will be picking up the pace of refranchising and franchise development in these divisions and expect to be approximately 10% franchised in China and 85% to 90% franchised in India by 2017. We expect the profitability and capital efficiency of our businesses will improve with this refranchising and importantly these actions along with the China sales recovery will boost our return on invested capital which we expect to reach at least 22% on 2017.","Finally, we pay a dividend which we've grown at a double-digit rate every year since we first paid the dividend in 2004. This equates to an annual dividend yield of about 2% which is very competitive for a company with our growth profile and we're committed to that.","So let me wrap things up, while we see additional headwinds for 2015 and the recovery at KFC China is taking longer than we anticipated, we are committed to EPS growth of at least 10% and restoring our track record of double-digit EPS growth going forward. We are also committed to ensuring the ownership model, create shareholder value and we'll be increasing our franchise mix in the years ahead.","And with that, I'll hand things back over to Greg.","Greg Creed","Thanks Pat. Before we begin the Q&A, let me just tell you why I'm passionate about this company and believe in the future of Yum! Brands. First, we have three iconic brands with incredible global infrastructure and franchise capability to facilitate growth. That's a strong competitive advantage to start with. Second, we have a China business with leading brands, supply chain, development expertise and of course people. Other companies would kill for what we have. Yes we've had some challenges over the past couple of years which have been painful for our shareholders. But that doesn\u2019t erase the company we built over the years, while the enormous opportunity ahead of us. We're going to turn this business around and when we do, we have a tremendous sales leverage opportunity to capture and I'm confident we will.","Our KFC division is an emerging market powerhouse as strong as this business I know it can get stronger. The top 10% of our restaurants are generating sales that are more than double the average KFC. Our assets are under-leveraged. We're going to remedy this by expanding operating hours, leveraging digital and strengthening the core and we expect the recent improved performance in the U.S. to continue.","Pizza Hut it's a powerful brand that quite frankly has underperformed over the past few years, but we adjusted a record in new unit openings. Think about this, if we can set a record in new unit openings when the brand is not growing same-store sales, just imagine what we can do when we get sales going. We're making digital our top priority and we're going to perform much better. ","Taco Bell is accelerating the unit opening lunch, breakfast and mobile ordering has fantastic innovation in high teen restaurant margins and with more focus and investment behind Taco Bell international I know we're going to make a significant progress in taking Taco Bell global as an organization we're going to build stronger brand we're going to have sharper our brand positioning and inside driven marketing program. And we're going to focus on the following areas more product customization, more transparency, leading innovation and much more engagement through social media and digital. And finally we're going to continue to give back to the community and deliver on our social responsibility commitment. All of these lead my goal of having brands that people stuff and champion is going to take hurries to do the right thing and it's going to take time. But we have to scale and the resources to do it. I firmly believe we're going to build stronger brand and all of these will lead to strong returns for our shareholders in 2015 and over the long term. ","So now I'll hand it back to Steve will commence to Q&A.","Steve Schmitt ","Okay we are ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","I just want to see if I caught a comment and then I'll have a question on that. It sounds like refranchising in China and India would actually be additive to profits in the near-term. Is that what I heard? ","Greg Creed","John I would say I'm not meaningfully additive.","John Ivankoe","Okay, but at least not dilutive. And then when we talk about cash flow and returns in some of these other things, it would clearly be accretive. So I guess there are two schools of thought with re-franchising, one of which, you know, you sell stores at a relatively low margin because you can, we talked about, have these sales not be dilutive to profit or maybe even modestly accretive to profit and let the franchisees turn around the system from a fairly low base. And there's another school of thought that you re-franchise stores once the brand has regained strength and is showing increases in same-store sales and margins and what have you, so you can put new stores in the hands of franchisees with some momentum behind them. So do you subscribe to either one of those schools of thought? Or how should we be thinking about re-franchising, broadly, especially when we think about the existing base of margins, for example, of Pizza Hut globally or especially China on a system wide basis?","Greg Creed","John generally speaking we love the franchise model we think it\u2019s a powerful way to create shareholder value and we've demonstrated that overtime. Our equity positions have been quite purposeful as we've talked about. But we've always guided our ownership with believe that we earned the right to own and this were we're not continuing to earn the right own and what we believe those units will create more shareholder value in the hands of franchisees capable franchisees who been continue to build the brand and develop alongside us as equity operators that\u2019s the direction we're headed. So our strategy hasn\u2019t changed at all guided by the underwrite to own if anything I would say building on what we presented in New York. Our goal is to be even more discipline in that regard.","John Ivankoe","So just to understand, you have no problem re-franchising stores at a relatively low price at a relatively low margin, if that's what you think is right for the long term of the business? ","Greg Creed","When we structure our refranchising deal we structure prices that we believe are there based on the current operating performance of those unit. And what we believe is there potential in the years ahead fair prices.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Palmer RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer ","You mentioned consumer perception scores are improving in China. Have those scores continued to improve even in recent weeks and months, or are those stalling out lately? And versus the competition, are you seeing a divergence in perceptions? Because it does appear that perhaps competitors are recovering more quickly. And what is that telling you about the business? And then lastly, is there anything in terms of your comparisons in the first quarter, perhaps marketing, media waits and other, that we should know about? Thank you. ","Greg Creed","David let me just say that the good news is that there has been sequential improvement in the metrics. Obviously we get KFC on a monthly basis that we're seen a month to month improvement in KFC obviously on Pizza Hut to get on quarterly basis. But the good news is that whether its food safety or trusts worthy on a liable brand all of those metrics are improving on a month to month basis. So that\u2019s the good news. The second part of your question was.","David Palmer ","About how does that compare to the competition and perhaps what does that tell you about how you handle it and perhaps how the consumers view you competitively on those trust scores. And then lastly, in terms of the comparisons on your marketing and media wait, is there anything to note there in terms of how we view this first quarter? ","Greg Creed","I think the good news is that the consumer metrics are in line with our key competitors in China. I mean they were planning in that the same direction at the same time. So I think in that sense there is no really disconnect between the including and metrics are now key competitors metrics. I think as you know a key competitor had greater sales originally then we had I put that down to the performance of the promotions that we were running in both December and obviously as we started running to the New Year. I think what's really important is that I think we're sequentially getting better and I think we've learned that, as Pat actually referred to in his commentary, we try to make the --no we've try to be useful in contemporary and maybe we got a little bit tune out and walked away from our course, but I'm excited about in the discussions I've been having with Sam and Joey, they were already course corrected. The advertising for the Chinese New Year promotion. We've also added some local store marketing for what will be the Chinese new promotion so what I'm really about is that course correcting very quickly when the promotions aren\u2019t working. We realized where we can get better and we're making those changes immediately.","Next question please Sharon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Glass, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass","If I could just ask one other question on China sales recovery, and then I have one on margin, is there anything to read into the fact that the Pizza Hut business is stronger than KFC, other than that supplier issue? In other words, does it say something about how the consumer is changing there? How do you know that's not the underlying or one of the underlying issues? Maybe can you speak to is it maybe is there an asset base issue at KFC that needs to be addressed as well as some of the promotions? ","Greg Creed","John I think as we look at everything from the consumer metrics everything else, we do believe that as we know KFC had two incidents consecutively, Pizza Hut had one. Pizza Hut's recovering in line with other people recovering in the marketplace. And we really do believe it's down to the fact that unfortunately KFC had two things. Now let's not forget KFC is the number one brand in China and obviously the growth that we've had from Pizza Hut over the years and continue to have as Pat talked about, so I remain incredibly confident in both KFC and Pizza Hut in China. And I'm just totally-totally confident that we're going to turn the thing around.","Pat Grismer","And John to the second part of your question around the role of the asset plays in all of this, as we outlined in New York, we see asset image being a critical component of our overall strategy to contemporize the brand. Last year we remodeled a bit over -- a bit more than 300 units, we'll do more than twice that number this year, as we look to move more aggressively to contemporize our assets recognizing that a fair portion of the stake was built just in the last five years so overall it's a fairly contemporary stake but for some of our older assets we will be moving more aggressively over the next year with a different remodel package in order to make a better progress there.","Thanks John. Next question please Sharon.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner, UBS. Your line is open.","Keith Siegner","Just to follow on the China theme a little bit longer, at the modeling session at the analyst event there was a 2015 guidance for what was hopefully 16%-plus on restaurant-level margins in China for the year. Given the updated thoughts on the top line, does that margin still hold or can we have an update to that margin outlook, please? Thanks. ","Greg Creed","Yes margin we still expect for the full year -- for the division to be at least 16%. ","Keith Siegner","Restaurant level margins, right?","Greg Creed","Yes, that is correct.","Keith Siegner","And if I could just sneak in a second one, is there any way you could give us some color? Are there pockets of weakness, pockets of strength? Is it tier 1 and tier 2, driven either above or below the average? Is it tier 4 through 6? Any kind of color you can give us to any potential pockets of weakness or strength in that same-store sales recovery would be helpful. ","Greg Creed","Yes Keith in the most recent quarter, we did see Tier 1 stores outperform -- the balance of the market, but really nothing to report other than that and our best assessment of that is that Tier 1 consumers seem to be maybe a little less phased by the supplier publicity this time around we're continuing to monitor this and at present we have nothing else really meaningful to share on that.","Next question please Sharon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Two questions -- just one on the China side. You mentioned, Greg, that you've had two supplier issues in two years and that's what you attribute the slower recovery. I was just wondering, first, if you could talk a little bit about the potential of the damage that might have caused to the consumer and what gives you confidence that there isn't necessarily a third? What are you doing in terms of improving the supply chain, since the frequency of that has picked up and might have caused damage to the consumer perception of the brand? And the second question was just on Taco Bell. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on the value versus premium side of things. It seems like we are hearing less about the higher end, maybe more on the lower end. I'm just wondering how you view that higher end opportunity, especially with fast casual doing so well. ","Greg Creed","Yes well first of all as I said the all the consumer metrics were improving both on KFC and Pizza Hut and obviously there are no indicator what's going to happen and there are also no indicator of consumer confidence, so the good news is that those are improving all moving in the right direction and that's what obviously I think really underpins the confidence I have that when we combine that with promotions that at our core user with better marketing and better value we're going to see the quicker turnaround of the performance in China. So those are the things that give me the most confidence is the consumer, the consumer metrics is moving in the right direction. ","On the Taco Bell story, I think Taco Bell had a great quarter as we all know when it was a combination of really everything. We had $5 box promotion with Sony. We had the launch of the value menu and I think that plus I think advertising in that really is resonating with the core user, it's driven out great consumer insights and human truth, so I really believe that Taco Bell is firing on all cylinders whether it's a $5 or whether it's just an engagement with the customer so very confident in the future of Taco Bell.","Jeffrey Bernstein","But any efforts to prevent a third type incident? Is there any changes in terms of the supply chain? ","Greg Creed","Obviously as you can imagine we've put a lot of things in place we\u2019ve now got which will blow our program we've obviously stepped up obviously the I guess the order thing is going on without supply I mean I think the one thing I can't promise is when they've happening if because if people are going to law and sheet do the wrong the thing. But you've got close like a TV which will blow our programs and expensive ordering going on I think we're doing all the right things you aspect to the later. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Joe Buckley","Also on China, could you just talk a little bit more about the December-January promotions? You described them as being too narrow, and just kind of what that means. And put perspective -- the planned menu revamps, how extensive will they be compared to the late March 2014 brand relaunch at KFC China? ","Greg Creed","Sure I think the first promotion, there is no doubt the team is right being trying to make the brand more youthful and contemporary. That\u2019s a really good thing that we're doing. But I think in the promotion everywhere this was around the Canadian brand here it so we obviously made it just too narrow and so we didn\u2019t really appeal to about core customer and I think was great and we're youthful and contemporary, the expression which was its Korean brand was actually just much too narrow. And I think the good news the teams learn a lesson but the great thing about when you have these things happen and as I said having spoken to same and Joe I've already course to be advertising for the CRB part of the Chinese New Year has already being shinned with also added extra resources to local store marketing. So I'm really confident that if it didn\u2019t work there intent was right the execution wasn\u2019t and we've learn it and we've already change the execution going forward. So that seems like all really good. The two main re-events obviously the big one will actually have in the first half the second one is not as quite as big as the first one. But I think we have a lot of confidence in menu re-events we know that work for us in the past the first half of last year they've worked and I have the lot of confidence that with the innovation in the product and improvement they're going to make that will see profound effect from this menu re-event.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Senatore ","One follow-up on China and then I have a question about Pizza Hut, if I may. Just on the China outlook it seems to me that January maybe got actually worse than December, based on what you are guiding to. And frequently as we are getting updates, it does feel like every time we get an update it's slower than expected or worse than expected. Can you just talk a little bit about is there a point at which you will entertain the idea that maybe you don't get back to peak volumes or you don't get back to peak margins, and maybe you think about the ownership structure a little bit differently? Just if we are sitting here in seven -- six, seven months from now and it doesn't look like you are getting the big bounce back in the second half, does that change your thoughts? And then my question on Pizza Hut is really, Greg, you did a great job with Taco Bell, I think really changed perception there. Can you just compare that to what's going on with Pizza Hut and what -- if the problems or the issues facing the brand are similar to what you saw, and how you think about that business? ","Greg Creed","I'll let Pat handle the first one and I'll take the Pizza there so.","Pat Grismer","Sarah on January sales in China I think the comps can be receiving right. So I was like to look at the underlying transactions and so we look at underlying transaction volumes on a weekly to season wise basis. And January was about in line with December so we've necessarily see the business deteriorate but didn\u2019t improved to the extent that we were expecting and so that\u2019s why I said we entered the year plus momentum that we had anticipated when we're all together in New York. As to what the pace looks like going forward as we've said the pace of recovery is slower than we expected best reason why was have the two incidence in two consecutive years. But there is no denying the fact that the business is recovering. We step back and we look at we're things were at the end of July were things were had in August and were things are today and there heck of lot better. We would have like to seen and we had anticipated the stronger recovery. But it\u2019s going to take longer but what we need it to give some time and we have strong believe in a programs of the team is lining which is sharpening as we've talked about to sustain the upper momentum. So that I would say by the time we lap the OSI incident in late July we expect comps to turn positive that is a longer recovery period than we've seen before. But we do see that recovery continuing and we know with that is substantial profit leverage. So we do expect that would be improving sales in the back half of the year will have improving margins and substantial improvement in overall profitability. Very similar to what we saw in the first half of 2014 so we don\u2019t have to go back to far in history to find good hard evidence of the resilience of our brands and our ability to bring the profit back in that business. As it relates to long term ownership again we take a long term view of our business we're in China for the long term and the last two years of volatility while yet painful don\u2019t erase more than a decade of substantial value creation China remains the biggest retail development opportunity in the world and we are the leaders in that market. So our view on the market to long term do we look opportunities to refine our ownership model, yes as we've indicated we've pivoting to quietly higher franchise ownership where it makes sense, where we can sensibly do that, given the nascency of franchising in China today. But we have strong belief in the power of our brands and the strength of our teams and our leading position in that market and we believe that that recovery is going to progress across this year.","Greg Creed ","So on the Pizza Hut story it's -- the flavor of now I love I think it's a positioning that is so right with what's happening in the entire food market, so I think that to start with. There's no doubt we want to make Pizza Hut more useful, now let's not talk Taco Bell it's a little bit more useful and the good news that's come out of the re-launch so far is that things like [rev] users as I think the 24 gone from like 6% of our business to 24% of our business. So we know that this whole new flavor is now positioning us resonate with them. Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t talking to our current abundant users and as we can tell we're now back on that with Rex Ryan and Tony Romo, so I think we're doing the right thing which is the flavor of them has really resonated with the younger customer audience where we've been really going after which is great. At the same time we got to make sure we don\u2019t lose our abundant customer, we want to make sure that that we've offered a great sort of pepperonis at a great price and what I'm excited about is we got 90% repeat on those who try the new products so getting more type of those new products will also be critical so I'm very happy with I think where we're going to take this brand and the positioning would anchor us around.","Sharon next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","David Tarantino","I'm going to give this question on China one more shot. My question is, how do you conclude that the recent trend was more related to those promotions you mentioned and not some structural issue with the brand that's happened post these two events? And said differently, how do you get confident that this recent trend in the sales volumes isn't more of just a new reality from which you have to grow from? ","Pat Grismer","I would say our best indication David is the consumer metrics that we're seeing brand I trust food and safety we've seen as Greg mentioned steady improvement month and month and no scores. As we discussed the recent promotions underperformed from the sales perspective, but consumer metrics continues to show improvement, so in our view it's a matter of getting the promotions right and we're taking strict action to show those up in the next several weeks here ahead of the first of our two menu revamps this year. So we have not seen anything at this stage which would give us a reason to believe that what we have here is a new normal. We think that this situation is temporary and again we faced a similar set of circumstances a year ago and we have the dramatic recovery in our China business just in the first half of 2014 so there's recent evidence that our brands are resilient. They'll bounce back. It's harder this time around because we've had the two incidents in two years, so that's why the recovery is taking longer. But as we've said recovery is progressing not at the pace that we'd like but its progressing and we continue to believe strongly that we'll have a strong second half.","Greg Creed","I mean David let me just I hadn\u2019t run Taco Bell for a long time. I've had my share of incidents. So I know what these are like. They're not linear. They never recover on a linear basis, but we do know that great iconic brands always recover. And we know what to do, we have to do innovation, we have to get our core customer back engaged and we had a very frank assessment of the promotion in January and December and we didn\u2019t get it right. And -- but the most important thing is, we're making changes going forward and that to me is really important so having been in the same situation that Sam and the team are. I've been in this situation. I have absolute confidence that iconic brands come back and they come back stronger than they were even some times before they went into it. I think Taco Bell is living proof of why I have absolute confidence we'll do that in China.","Next question please Sharon.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Karen Holthouse","So sorry to ask the same question in another way, but one of the things I think we've been seeing in general consumer reports about China is that health and wellness is becoming a bigger concern and a bigger focus for the average consumer there. Have you done anything in terms of your positioning in perceptions of health and wellness and\/or just your sense of whether that is becoming a bigger focus of the Chinese consumer? And maybe potentially that's an overhang on the brand beyond [new] brand scores and whatnot that sounds like, say, everything should be getting better. ","Greg Creed","I think that what you talked about we're seeing on a global scale right it's we're not just seeing it in China, we're not just seeing in the United States, we're seeing it everywhere. Clearly what you would call health and wellness those -- the importance of that is clearly growing. So I think that in a sense just like at Taco Bell we offer Fresco and at Pizza Hut we offer Skinny Pie and at KFC we offer grilled, and in China we offer congee, and vegetables and food and milk and all that sort of things, so it's -- I don\u2019t think China is ahead of anyone else, I don\u2019t think China is behind anyone else. I think that at the end of the day, we've got choice with our customers to make, but at the same time we got to make sure that the promotions that we run are relevant and appeal to our core audience and we just simply got to do a better job of that in China.","Karen Holthouse","But if you look at some of the products you just mentioned, how big are they actually as a percent of sales versus the core menu that's more fried chicken and fries? And then I have to imagine if you were to look at the overall market, kind of young's share of what you would consider traditional, not necessarily healthy fast food is a lot higher than your share of more traditional congee, vegetable soup, that sort of thing? ","Greg Creed","Accounted to mean why look at these things mix around 2% doesn\u2019t matter what Taco Bell it doesn\u2019t matter what it is these things started to have huge mixes. But the key is for us to give the customer a choice and I think that\u2019s what we do doesn\u2019t matter on what brand and what country what we got a valuable for our customer is choice. But the mix is we'll probably stepping around 3% I think that there are much bigger things of play I mean making sure that we've got great food a great value making sure that our brands are relevant making sure that this share worthy. I mean all these sort of things I was important there is not one thing is driving it is and a specific thing all these on a global scale and we're reacting to them on the global basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer Company. Your line is open.","Brian Bittner","You talk about unlocking shareholder value in China by leveraging the recovery into significant earnings growth and maybe taking a more disciplined franchising approach there. And that's definitely going to serve your shareholders well. But at the same time, the business outside of China -- it's very franchised, very highly franchised. The business is very under-levered and performing very, very well. Taco Bell, KFC -- just great results. And your peers are getting really strong appreciation in the public markets for similar type business models that you guys arguably are not. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can do to capitalize on that dynamic to unlock shareholder value, not necessarily from a business operations standpoint. But maybe is there an appetite to maybe take on more leverage? Or anything that you can talk about, your way of thinking there would be helpful. ","Greg Creed","Well let me start and then I will handover to Pat. We will always have the often structure to drive shareholder value let me be really clear. Right now obviously we believe turning China around is the key and obviously we believe China is a long term play for us I think that\u2019s very clear.","Pat Grismer","And certainly as it relates to ownership level outside the U.S and how that relates to our capital structure. I think I won't understand based on what we outlined in New York that we are pivoting to a more highly franchise model going forward and we expect those franchise percentages to edge up over the next three years. With respect to capital structure we look at things the enterprise level. So we don\u2019t segment our balance sheet by division and we look at our capital structure the enterprise level based on the adjusted leverage ratios that rating agencies look at and how that relates to our cost of capital. As I outlined in New York having taking the advices three large independent Bank who have check our analysis to make sure we're thinking about just right way we believe that our current leverage ratio which is a lowest run of investment great credit. We optimize our weighted average cost of capital. If we were to take on additional debt to an extent that we take us into junk bond territory as we do the number we see what I would characterize as a modest amount accretion and frankly given the trade off in terms of reduced flexibility and our ability to optimize that weighted average cost of capital across economic cycle. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good result it's not in the best interest of our shareholder in our judgment. But we do look at it as I know you'd expect we do look at couple a time in year we put a lot of rigor behind it because we are very concerned about making sure that our capital structure is the right one for our shareholders in long term. The one that supports our ability to return cash to our shareholders the way that we have consistently through a combination of a growing dividend and substantial share buyback were also having the cash necessary to continue to invest aggressively behind growth opportunities.","Greg Creed ","I would add just some we've got a great track record of driving shareholders value and we obviously believe that model will deliver outstanding returns going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","Jeff Farmer","Just following up on several recent questions, specifically a lot of those about the recent products and promotion stuff that's going on at KFC in China -- so I'm just curious. Are you guys able to test a lot of that new product and promotion strategies before you implement them? And if not, I'm curious what gives you confidence that you are making appropriate strategy shifts as we get deeper into 2015? ","Greg Creed","We have a very rigorous discipline process in China and we can't hit everything I don\u2019t teach and go out test rock bands and rock bands and those like things they get a little bit more difficult to test. But I think the repositioning of tower products or the new product in the more traditional sides we can definitely test and in fact I would say that China has probably has one of the most rigorous testing methods and in fact a lot of this is adopted those methods outside of China among the other brand. So I am confident that over right testing is going we can test some but sometimes you just can't test every possible promotion.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Peter Saleh Telsey Advisor Group. Your line is open.","Peter Saleh ","I just wanted to come back to the China menu revamp. If I recall correctly, last year there was more of a check benefit from the revamp of the menu. And there wasn't a traffic increase, but more of the comp came from increases in the average check. When you think about the revamp this year, at least the first one, are you targeting more of a traffic or maybe more of a check increase similar to last year? ","Pat Grismer ","Peter, we expect with all our innovation to build transaction momentum. Now with the construct of the menu revamp with some more premium products, we also expect to check benefit. This will improve profitability, but our goal, our goal over the long run is to rebuilt the traffic that we've lost and so we do expect that with this menu revamp there's going to be sufficient innovation and continued focus on value to sustain the traffic momentum necessary to recover the business and realize that that full upside profit potential.","Next question please Sharon and this is our last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar. Your line is open.","R.J. Hottovy","Just one more quick question on China -- I appreciate the comments about the consumer perception scores improving and your blueprint for sales recovery in the region. I wanted to get a sense on your take. Have you seen any change in demand among potential franchisees in the market following the recent supplier issues? I know you are building towards a 10% franchise goal by fiscal 2017. I just wanted to get any color on any potential changes among franchisees you are targeting. ","Greg Creed","Yes no changes R.J. We regained the number brand even with the issues that we've experienced. And our pipeline of franchisees comes from our restaurant general managers and area managers, so we continue to develop strong capability there and among our table of RGMs, general managers, our entrepreneurs who are -- who remain quite eager to take on the opportunity to own and operate our KFC restaurants predominantly in our Tier 1 cities, so that continues to be the strategy. We've not seen any slackening of demand in that regard.","Greg Creed","Yes so thank you everybody. First of all thanks for being on the call. I just like to thank I think by saying I was personally delighted to see Taco Bell had a great fourth quarter. And I think a lot of the things that we've done at Taco Bell whether it's a very clear trend or whether it's really very insight driven, whether it's we've got really amazing innovation, advertising that connects and a social mobile digital that really engages with our customers, I think that's what has really helped Taco Bell had a great fourth quarter and a great year. So it probably should come as no surprise to anybody those are maybe the things that are going to be driving as I -- in I go further I visit countries and I'm talking to the brands that don\u2019t be surprised to see me focusing on the exactly those same things because I know they\u2019ve worked at Taco Bell. I absolutely believe we can do them in KFC and Pizza Hut in every country around the world. So with that I really appreciate you all being on the call and I look forward to seeing you soon. Thanks very much everybody.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22957":["Yum! Brands, Inc.

Brands Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.","All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy, you may begin your conference.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Suzanne. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. Following remarks from Greg and Pat, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.","All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands website at yum.com to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today\u2019s call.","We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in future use of the recording.","Finally, we would like to make you aware of the following upcoming Yum! Investor Events, our 2015 Investor and Analyst conference would be on December 10th in Dallas, Texas and our fourth quarter earnings release would be on Wednesday February 3rd.","And with that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed","Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. Delivering 14% EPS growth in today\u2019s environment would normally be considered a very good result. But these are not normal times and our performance is anything but satisfactory.","I know that you all want to hear about China today and have many questions that we are going to answer for you. But before I spend most of my time today on China, I do want to talk about the performance of our three global brands.","Taco Bell, as you have rightfully come to expect, had another great quarter. Same store sales growth of 4% rolled over plus 3% from a year ago and with another 3% sales growth from new units. Year-to-date, this has doubled the number of new units from last year and margins are now over 21%. This brand is doing all the right things in all the right places.","KFC had another solid quarter. Same store sales growth of plus 3% with another 3% from new units. We saw notable standout performance in Australia, Russia and Japan and some underperformance versus trend for South Africa and the UK. While KFC in the U.S. is still a small component of the global brand, it continued a steady progress with transactions plus 4% to the category, as the innovation pipeline is now starting to be a force.","Pizza Hut was relatively flat, which we could argue was pretty much in line with expectations. But let\u2019s be honest; we\u2019re still significantly lagging the performance of our nearest competitors and we clearly have much urgent work to do for this brand to fulfill its potential, which brings me on to what we all want to talk about which is China.","Let me start by being really clear. We all and I personally take full accountability for our results in China. And while there is clearly a macro softening going on including headwinds from unexpected foreign exchange pressures and yes, the online ordering aggregators who are delivering for mom and pops are in a death battle for supremacy with heavy discounting and the malls look more like fancy food courts than shopping centers, the simple facts are that the economy there is still growing and there is every reason and no excuses to why we should not perform better. I also want you to know that our new China CEO Micky Pant and his team also get it and as I\u2019ll detail are taking significant measures to get sales, traffic and profits back to historic levels.","If I step back and look at our own research and independent research, they both show that KFC and Pizza Hut have very strong positions. KFC is the undisputed leader in QSR and Pizza Hut owns western casual dining. And both own the hearts and minds of the Chinese customer. And as I\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll say again, we wouldn\u2019t trade places with anyone.","So the obvious question is what\u2019s going on; why is this taking way too long to recover and in particular, what happened over the past six to seven weeks, particularly in Pizza Hut casual dining?","Let me start with KFC, which did see sequential improvement and is on trend to continue that improvement into the fourth quarter and beyond. With Micky Pant now at the helm, we have a fresh set of eyes and we are taking the following immediate actions. First, we are sharpening our brand positioning and we will position and market KFC as the unequivocal Chinese favorite; always original, always Chinese.","Second, we are rejuvenating the product pipeline and dramatically improving our discipline and effectiveness around products testing. We have also begun to test new simplified menu boards that will speed up the ordering process and importantly return and celebrate our core chicken products.","Third, we will introduce more disruptive value innovation. We will drive transactions, which we know we can do profitably with box meals and day of the week specials, like we have done in the rest of the world.","And fourth, we will take our proven pipeline of successful chicken innovation from around the world and adapt it to Chinese taste. Both Micky and are confident that these actions will reinvigorate the KFC brand and help us fully recover and more over time.","So, this leads me to Pizza Hut casual dining in China. Historically we have delivered amazing growth by revamping 25% of our menu every six months. However, it\u2019s clear to all that recent promotions have not performed at historical levels and let me give you a couple of examples.","In mid-August, we launched a premium-priced steak product, in hindsight, just as the macro started to weaken. Furthermore in recent weeks, we\u2019ve seen companies cut back on parties, dinners and entertaining. So, while our weekend business is going okay, this has impacted our weekday dinner results significantly. So what we are doing about it? We are adding a weekday value dinner promotion on top of the scheduled menu revamp that starts October 19th.","And if I look back at our previous success, it\u2019s when we\u2019ve offered five-star service at three-star prices. The calendar this year has had things that are more like six-star products such as fajitas and premium steak at six-star pricing at a time when consumers are seeking value. So, we are going to get back to what made us great five-star pizza, pasta and wings at three-star pricing. ","I know that we are rightly in show me time versus tell me time. But I\u2019m confident that our current performance is no indication of our future potential and that our best days are still ahead across China, India in the three global brands.","So, in conclusion for Yum!, this is proving to be a more challenging second half driven by a slower recovery in China and the foreign exchange headwinds. However, we believe in the long-term strength of our company. As further evidence of this, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend last night. This marks the 11th consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our dividend at a double-digit rate.","In summary, we are in a unique position at Yum! with three category leading brands that we will strengthen and grow into three iconic global brands that people trust and champion. We remain focused on the three keys to driving shareholder value: New unit development, same-store sales growth, and generating high returns on invested capital. We believe this combination of efforts will enable us to generate consistent shareholder value in the years ahead.","Now, before I hand this over to Pat, some of you may want to ask today about our views around corporate structure and whether any of the news we\u2019ve shared with you today has any bearing on how we think about our company. The fact is we have a great collection of businesses and they have produced excellent results over the long-term. As I\u2019ve said before, the Yum! Board of Directors regularly reviews strategic options to optimize long-term shareholder value including those involving our corporate structure. We are not going to comment today on any strategic options with our company. As usual, we will discuss our growth plans for 2016 and long-term strategies at our investor conference in December and I hope we will see you there.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn things over to Pat.","Pat Grismer","Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter results and share some details behind our current full year outlook.","As Greg mentioned, Taco Bell continues to be strong, KFC is solid and Pizza Hut remains in turnaround mode. But the big story is our China Division which is recovering but obviously and disappointingly at a much slower pace than we previously expected. Recent week sales in China have significantly dampened our balance of year outlook, particularly at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. I\u2019ll spend a fair bit of time on China.","But to quickly recap financial results for the third quarter, earnings per share excluding special items increased 14%, a marked improvement from the 7% EPS decline we delivered in the first half of the year.","Same-store sales not only turned positive in China but were also positive in all three of our global brand divisions. Worldwide restaurant margins at company owned stores were 18%, an increase of 3 percentage points versus prior year. Foreign currency translation adversely impacted our EPS growth by nearly 6 percentage points in the quarter including an unexpected devaluation of the RMB in mid-August. Here are the highlights of each division\u2019s results and the implications for full year performance.","China Division operating profit increased by 64% prior to foreign currency translation with restaurant margins approaching 20%, nearly 5 percentage points better than last year. The China team continued to do an excellent job of managing costs and I\u2019m confident that the team\u2019s sustained productivity improvements will yield meaningful profit upside as sales recover over the long term.","As expected, sales turned significantly positive as we lapped last year\u2019s supplier incident which occurred in late July, specifically in the first seven weeks of the third quarter leading up to the supplier incident lap, same-store sales for the division averaged minus 11% and then for the next four weeks averaged plus 31%, representing a 42-point swing to the positive, giving us optimism that the recovery was underway. For the entire quarter, same-store sales grew 2% for the division including 3% growth at KFC and a 1% decline at Pizza Hut Casual Dining.","So that\u2019s the past but what about the future, more specifically now that we are in the fifth week of China\u2019s fourth quarter, how are China sales trending and how does that shape our perspective on full year results; and as importantly how could we have missed our previous forecast by so much? I\u2019ll answer both questions.","Encouragingly, KFC same-store sales in China are continuing to recover as evidenced by our most recent sales results. As a point of reference, KFC China\u2019s same-store sales were plus 9% for the month of September which is the first month in China\u2019s fourth quarter. Based on what we know today, we expect Q4 will be another quarter of sequential improvement for KFC in China. To be clear however, this recovery is occurring at a slower pace than we previously estimated and this is weighing on our prior outlook for fourth quarter results. At Pizza Hut Casual Dining, the situation is much more severe and impactful. In late August and continuing into September, we witnessed a very substantial deceleration in same-store sales versus our forecast. The loss of sales momentum is causing significant deleverage in our Pizza Hut Casual Dining business, which represents about a third of China Division profits.","Based on our current assessment, we believe the drivers are three-fold: Number one, extraordinary volatility in financial markets, the surprise currency devaluation and overall softer economic conditions are weighing more heavily on the higher ticket casual dining sector in China. Number two; we are experiencing what we believe is a short-term but significant impact of online ordering aggregators entering the casual dining space. And number three and most importantly, our marketing promotions materially underperformed our expectations, as Greg said and we lost significant momentum in the business which we\u2019re now working to recover and believe we can fix.","We did not foresee this confluence of events and quite frankly we are very surprised by the business trends that began to unfold at the end of August. As another point of reference, Pizza Hut Casual Dining same-store sales were actually down 3% for the month of September, demonstrating a very rapid downturn in the business. This was 25 points below our previous expectations, a major miss and something we didn\u2019t see coming in August.","Based on current trends now about one-third of the way into China\u2019s fourth quarter, we expect Pizza Hutt Casual Dining sales in China will remain negative through the end of the year possibly into low double digits. On that basis, we now estimate the China Division same-store sales will be mid-single-digit positive for the fourth quarter and low-single-digit negative for the full year. This is obviously a very disappointing result and well below our previous expectations even as the China team is working with urgency to improve sales momentum at both KFC and Pizza Hut.","So what\u2019s our current outlook -- so that\u2019s our current outlook but why didn\u2019t we forecast this. As I mentioned earlier, the deceleration in China sales was led by Pizza Hut and the drivers behind that decline emerged very rapidly and without much warning. In today\u2019s volatile environment with the recent macro and competitive pressures we mentioned, it continues to be difficult to forecast sales in China for both brands. We make our best judgment at any point in time based on the information available. We will provide another update on China sales at our investor meeting in December.","Turning to our KFC Global Division, we saw another quarter of growth in sales, margin and profit prior to foreign currency translation. Sales were particularly strong in Australia, Japan and Russia and we were pleased with same-store sales growth of 2% in the U.S. as it included same-store transaction growth of 3%, demonstrating continued improvement in this business. These results were partially offset by softer sales in South Africa, Thailand and the UK. Despite the benefit of sales leverage, division operating margin decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to increased advertising expense associated with our U.S. turnaround program which also impacted the division\u2019s profit growth by 2 percentage points in the quarter. Division operating margins were also impacted by 1 percentage point due to strategic investments in G&A and increased pension expense.","All in, KFC\u2019s operating profit grew 3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Importantly, KFC new unit development remains strong with 335 new international restaurants opened year to date. And on a net basis, we\u2019ve opened over 40% more new international restaurants in the first three quarters of 2015 versus 2014. This gives us great confidence in the strength of the KFC brand and its growth oriented franchisees.","At Pizza Hut, same-store sales grew 1% including growth of 4% in emerging markets offset by flat sales in developed markets including the U.S. Total operating profit excluding foreign exchange was unchanged versus last year, despite same-store sales growth and lower cheese prices; this is primarily due to strategic investments in international G&A. As Greg mentioned, we clearly have our work cut out for us to Pizza Hut. However we are taking positive steps and making necessary investments to improve Pizza Hut\u2019s brand position, operations and digital experience. From an international development prospective, we opened 105 new units in the quarter, bringing our year to date number to 206.","Finally, Taco Bell continued to post excellent results with same-store sales growth of 4%, overlapping 3% growth from last year. A strong combination of value and innovation drove this result. We were also pleased with the performance of our breakfast daypart which contributed 6% sales mix and gives us a great platform from which to grow.","Restaurant level margins of 22% were 140 basis points better than a year ago helped by a tailwind in commodities as beef and cheese prices had both declined about 13%. From a development perspective, we opened 111 net new restaurants year to date which is nearly double our number at this point last year and demonstrates a compelling economic model and strong franchisee investment in the brand.","So, how does all of this ladder up to a revised full year outlook? I\u2019ll start by acknowledging that this is well below our previous guidance led by a much lower sales outlook at Pizza Casual Dining in China and exacerbated by incremental foreign exchange pressure. As outlined earlier, we now estimate the China division same-store sales will be low single digit negative for the full year. As a result, we expect China Division\u2019s full year profits will grow versus prior year in the mid to high single digits excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","Collectively, our global brand divisions are largely in line with our previous expectations with better than expected performance at Taco Bell compensating for lower than expected performance at Pizza Hut. And finally, stronger than expected foreign exchange headwinds including the mid-August R&D devaluation are putting an incremental 1 to 2 percentage points of pressure on our EPS growth rate for the year. On a full year basis, we now expect foreign exchange in total to be about 6 percentage points of EPS headwind, significantly more than what we expected as we entered the year and the most pressure that we\u2019ve ever experienced in the history of our company.","With all of this in mind, we are lowering our guidance for 2015 and now expect EPS growth to be low single digit positive. To be clear, the key drivers are a significant reduction in China sales and a meaningful increase in foreign exchange headwinds, neither of which we saw coming at the time of our last forecast update.","In terms of new unit development, we expect to open about 2,000 units outside the U.S. this year. Now, I know many of you are wondering why we are continuing to open new restaurants in China at a fairly rapid pace and I\u2019ll share a point of view on that because we continue to expect about 700 new unit openings in China this year. First of all, cash paybacks in our current new units across both KFC and Pizza Hut continue to be in the range of 3 to 4 years which we believe provides an attractive return on invested capital. Obviously this assumes that current conditions are temporary which is what we strongly believe and are continuing to monitor.","Now when it comes to development, we take a long-term view of the growth opportunity in China which despite recent volatility, continues to be the fastest growing major economy in the world with strong long-term tailwinds for the restaurant industry including a doubling of the consuming class.","When you step back and look at what the industry will be 10 to 20 years from now, we believe we are still in the early innings. We have leading brands with strong competitive positions and unmatched development capability in this market. Remember, new unit development has been a number one driver of China Division profit growth over the years and we expect this to be the case in the future. And one thing we know about development is that once you lose momentum in terms of indentifying and securing retail sites it\u2019s tough to regain it.","Now, don\u2019t think we have our head in the sand regarding recent results in their implications for development. We absolutely take account of these results and evaluate each new unit development opportunity in a very disciplined fashion. And we are certainly taking a very close look at the situation that is unfolded at Pizza Casual Dining and determining how that may impact near term development plans, similar to how we scale back on KFC development in recent years. At the same time, we are just getting started with Pizza Hut home service and continue to be confident that Chinese consumer demand for delivered meals will rise rapidly.","We are still in the process of shaping our plans for 2016, so it\u2019s premature to give guidance for next year\u2019s development in China. However it\u2019s quite possible that we will temper the pace of Pizza Casual Dining development until we are absolutely sure that we have a solid understanding of what\u2019s happening with the brand and how that may impact our investment returns for the long run. We will provide an update on this at our December investor conference.","Outside of China and India, nearly 90% of our new units this year will be opened by our franchise partners. And we are building momentum around the world to evolve to the more franchise owned model we talked about at last year\u2019s investor conference. This refranchising activity will gain momentum over the next couple of years and will vary by brand but in the aggregate we still expect to achieve a mid-90s franchise ownership percentage by the end of 2017 excluding China and India.","Before I conclude, I\u2019d like to point out that our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve generated EBITDA of almost $2 billion and importantly, we remain disciplined in how we use this cash and have a good track record of returning all available cash to our shareholders. As evidence of this, we announced the 12% increase in our quarterly dividend last night. As Greg mentioned, this marks the 11th consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our dividend at a double-digit rate. With this latest increase, we also raised our long-term dividend payout target to 45% to 50% of annual net income before special items.","You might have also read about some good news we received from Moody\u2019s recently. With the change in their rating methodology whereby they\u2019ve reduced imputed debt from eight times annual rent expense to six times annual rent expense, we\u2019ve gained nearly $2 billion of additional debt capacity while maintaining our investment grade credit rating with Moody\u2019s. We\u2019re pleased with this decision and our evaluating its implications for our capital structure holistically. We\u2019ve consistently been very disciplined about optimizing our capital structure for our shareholders and as usual, we\u2019ll talk about our capital structure and any potential changes at our investor conference in December.","So in conclusion, 2015 is now on a very different trajectory than we have previously expected, largely due to slower than expected sales in China, particularly at Pizza Casual Dining and higher than expected pressure from foreign exchange. However, we remain confident in the long-term health of our business, we have a past double-digit EPS growth and we look forward to sharing our plans to get our whole business back on track in 2016 at our December investor meeting.","And with that, I\u2019ll open up the line to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC. Your line is open.","David Palmer","Thanks, good morning. I realized you\u2019re going to be reticent to talk about structure changes with the business but I mean one fundamental observation about Yum! today is that the last three years have been one where the company is no longer hitting the 10% plus EPS growth, the combination of growth rate and consistency is broken down. Thinking about Yum! going forward, obviously structure change could be part of the solution there but if the company doesn\u2019t make a structure change as you\u2019re observing the business today, what can you do to restore the consistency in growth?","Greg Creed","So David, let me just start, I think as you know, over the last three years particularly in China, we had two food safety incidents and obviously we\u2019ve had marketing missteps. So clearly, what we got to do is primarily turn around China. I think where we do perform well, we\u2019ve got the following in place, we\u2019ve got very clear brand positioning, we have insight driven product innovation, we have disruptive value, we have upgraded assets, we have social, mobile and digital at the cutting edge and we deliver the customer a superior experience. So we know those are the things that when we deliver, we deliver outstanding results. So, I think the thing we have to do in all the divisions is to get back and execute against those basics. So that\u2019s what I got the organization absolutely focused on. So my number one priority is to turn around China using all of those I guess tools or directions that I\u2019ve just articulated.","David Palmer","And just a follow-up on the China business that low double-digit decline for Pizza Hut, if that\u2019s in the low 20s percent of that China business, that low double-digit decline would imply the mid-single-digit system same-store sales something like mid teens comp for the KFC brand. Is that math about right and how do you feel about the two-year trend and the momentum on the KFC China side?","Pat Grismer","David that math actually isn\u2019t right. We\u2019re expecting mid-single-digit same-store sales positive for KFC -- for the division, excuse me, in the fourth quarter. So with negative same-store sales for Pizza Hut, they could be in the low double-digits. The KFC number could be in the range of high single-digits to low double-digits.","David Palmer","Okay, thank you. And how do you feel about that momentum on a two-year basis or just -- versus your plan before is KFC part of this guide down at all?","Pat Grismer","Well obviously, it\u2019s well below our previous outlook. There is no question whether you look at a one-year or two-year or three-year relative to where we were as of our Q2 earnings call, there has been a substantial reduction in overall momentum. The important thing is that the recovery is continuing with KFC, albeit at a slower than expected pace and we have evidence of that. The real issue we have is with Pizza Hut Casual Dining where we saw a very sudden and sharp deceleration take shape at the end of August and persist now into the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Karen Holthouse","Looking at the unit growth in China instead of the comp growth, we\u2019ve seen another tick up in unit closures at KFC. Can we just get a little bit more color on where those are coming from? Is it more, higher tier cities or you might be coming up against lease renewals, lower tier cities that might have some more macro issues? The rates doubled sort of since last quarter and more than doubled year-over-year. So what\u2019s driving that step function?","Pat Grismer","Definitely there has been an uptick in China unit closures relative to our original expectations. Part of that is Little Sheep; there continue to be closures in Little Sheep and that is placing a drag on net unit growth; we do expect about 60 closures there this year. But every year we have a base of store closures including forced closures, relocation opportunities and lease expirations.","So even if we had no underperforming stores, we would go for closure. But at KFC, it is true that performance driven closures have been higher than we anticipated coming into the year and that\u2019s really the cumulative effect of three years of softer than expected sales. We do look at these on an individual basis and there are unique circumstance supporting each one of those decisions.","As to how the mix may have shifted to where the closures are coming from, for KFC about 70% have been in the higher tier cities and we are seeing a higher mix in the lower tier cities but that only involves a handful of stores. From a trade zone perspective, we\u2019re not seeing material shifts between commercial, residential and retail although within retail we are seeing a higher proportion of closures at hypermarkets and malls as opposed to department stores. And then I guess the last thing I would point out is that in terms of the mix of closures based on the year that the stores were opened, we are seeing a slight uptick in the percentage of stores that are being closed that relate to the ramp up in our development in 2011 and 2012 and we think that that may continue.","But I just want to reinforce that with what we see by way of new unit returns and the confidence that provides us around development and how that creates value for shareholders, we continue to expect to open about 700 units this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler of CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane Geissler","Another question on China; I wanted to talk about the online delivery which seems to have been sort of a cutthroat this year and probably the source of the biggest surprise, maybe in disruption. I know there are some rumors in the media about one of the big O2O and restaurant review apps merging, which maybe reduces the number of players but how can investors have confidence that the situation will improve in 2016? Because it just seems so competitive and I guess, as you look at your Pizza Hut business in China, what are you doing specifically to get yourself where you need to be to either -- to be more active in delivery or have a bigger slice of that? Because it just seems like the O2O players are pushing the mom and pop restaurants and that\u2019s obviously to your competitive disadvantage. Can you talk a little bit about what you plan to do specifically to address the competitive pressures in the delivery business?","Greg Creed","Let me answer that holistically. First of all, delivery is -- we have about 300 delivery units which is a small part of our overall business compared to Pizza Hut in China. But as you said, there is definitely what we call a savage battle for supremacy going on about -- around the aggregators who are obviously heavily discounting. We are actually putting our foot in the water and playing with them but it\u2019s a very small part of our business. So, I think the answer is that we don\u2019t believe that the economics will sustain all the people that are currently in the market playing at these discounted prices.","And I think as we\u2019ve seen these aggregators in other parts of the world because China is not the only place where this is occurring, what tends to happen is they are all fighting for market share dropping the prices but then eventually the prices have to go up. And secondly the actually delivery experience from these aggregators we would argue is not as good as delivery experience that we deliver from Pizza Hut.","So, I think the answer is there is a lot of savage market share fights going on. We don\u2019t believe in the long term that they can sustain these discounts. We know in the rest of the world prices go up; we know that their performance -- their delivery performance is not as good as ours but that does not mean that we haven\u2019t -- we are not dabbling in this area, obviously testing as part of the Pizza Hut strategy.","Diane Geissler","If you look at experience sort of outside of china when this has occurred before, what has been the average length of time that it\u2019s taken for the industry to sort of shake itself out?","Greg Creed","Well, I think that it\u2019s very early as this is occurring -- it\u2019s very early days for this whole aggregator business but I can assure you that we are monitoring it on a global basis whether it is Europe, Asia, North America, Australia wherever it is going on. It\u2019s way too early to call how long that\u2019s going to take but it is very clear that -- while I guess it\u2019s a little more mature we\u2019ve seen these businesses move from burning a lot of cash or heavy discounting into taking price increases and obviously that\u2019s going to stunt consumer demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Senatore","I have two questions, one -- both follow-ups on China. One is really a communication question. Back in late August when you were about 10 days before the end of the quarter in China, you put out a filing that remarked on the significant recovery. I guess a lot of us are really surprised that the 3Q number came in so much below our own expectations, given that the language or what would seem to be the message is that things are on track. So, did we misinterpret the filing; did something happen in the last week and a half? I guess I\u2019m just trying to reconcile what seems to have been positive commentary fairly late in the quarter with the 3Q results and setting aside maybe what may have happened in September and subsequently in 4Q. And then, I\u2019ll have another question.","Greg Creed","Well, I can\u2019t speak to how you or others interpreted what we said. But as I said in my remarks earlier, the facts are that in the seven weeks leading up to the lap, the average same-store sales for the division were minus 11 and then for the next four weeks swung 42 points to the positive to plus 31. So in fact, same-store sales had turned significantly as we lapped last year\u2019s supplier incident.","Sara Senatore","But were you then expecting low-single digit comps for the third quarter because the second half guidance implied low-double digits for the both halves? So, I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out, to your point maybe it was our interpretation but did the third quarter surprise you?","Greg Creed","Clearly third quarter results in total were below the expectations we had as of our second quarter earnings release. So, at the time of our second quarter earnings release based on results we saw at the time, we expected as we mentioned that the recovery would continue across the second half of the year. And I believe on the call we effectively affirmed for the second half double-digit positive same-store sales growth and that was our strong belief at the time based on what we were reading in the business. As of the date of this announcement that you mentioned, we referenced that sales turned significantly positive as we lapped the supplier incident from last year which was the fact supported by the numbers that I shared with you.","Sara Senatore","And then my other question, this goes back to again -- I know you are not going to discuss strategic actions but I think pretty much every quarter, we\u2019ve been disappointed by top line versus expectations at an increasingly wide gap. So, there is some question about the strategy and you\u2019ve talked about that. Clearly the stock market is saying that Yum! is not creating a lot of value right now. At what point do you decide if it\u2019s not three years of flat earnings, at what point is it time to reconsider the view that you are absolutely the right people to run the day-to-day operations of Yum! China, or to have the structure that you have right now?","Greg Creed","Well, the key for us is to turn this business around with particular focus on China. I think that anything else is speculation. But I can absolutely assure you that we have three great global brands that we are absolutely focused on doing the things that I talked about earlier brand positioning, product innovation, disruptive value, upgraded assets, social, mobile, digital and in then the superior customer experience. We have to get that in all five divisions. When we get that in all five divisions, then we\u2019ll obviously earn the right to have the share price that we believe this business deserves. So that is my absolute focus. Having said that we are always open to looking at alternatives and I\u2019ve said we are looking at alternative. But right now my absolute focus is on getting these five divisions firing pretty much like I\u2019d like them firing like Taco Bell is firing right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is open.","Brian Bittner","I know I am probably not going to get an answer to this, so maybe it\u2019s just more of a statement than anything. But look I acknowledge that China has fit historically into the long term growth plan and as everyone has been talking about, it has been hurting the model and the valuation of your stock for three years now. But the problem here is the visibility looking forward is no better today than it was last year or the year before. And Greg, you started the call talking about everything but China, because you really wanted to highlight the strength in that business.","But the way Yum! is structured today, China is all that matters and we all know that. And at some point I wonder when the board and the management team believes that the China turnaround story no longer makes sense to completely dominate the investment conversation for Yum! Brands and at some point, when they would believe a separation is a more realistic option I think for the sake of what appears to be an undeniable opportunity for value enhancement, not just in the near-term but the long-term? I mean, you are basically getting no credit for having the China business in your portfolio today. I could argue you are almost getting zero dollars of value for that business. And at some point, a China turnaround may happen and could happen and there could be a plan where investors still participate in that upside but also get the choice to participate in that upside and can invest in the ex China business which is performing beautifully. And I\u2019m just wondering if there is any timeline or more focus in the board room on understanding that and thinking about that?","Greg Creed","I think what I can say is we\u2019re always going to believe in China and we\u2019re always going to participate in its growth. Let me be really clear. I think we\u2019ve also got a new leader on the ground in China and with the new leader comes fresh ideas and a fresh perspective. And there is no doubt that he is taking a lot of the ideas that we know have proven and worked around the world and we\u2019re putting those into test aggressively whether it\u2019s KFC or Pizza Hut in China. So that\u2019s what I believe is the best answer which is we continue to believe in China, we all like to participate in China\u2019s growth, we\u2019ve got a new leader, he is bringing massive action to bear, which is great because he ran the Global KFC and Pizza Hut businesses in his prior job. He knows what\u2019s worth; he knows what\u2019s resonating with customers; he knows how to adapt certain taste to local taste. And that guy is doing everything he can do. He is being incredibly well received by the China team. People are saying he is incredibly smart. He is incredibly experienced. He is incredibly humble. He is incredibly collaborative. And he has an action agenda.","So, as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019ve got a new leader in place who is going to bring all of his ability to bear to turn it around. And as I\u2019ve said we\u2019ll always believe in China and we\u2019ll always going to participate in its growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jason West","Just I guess going back to the competitive issues, particularly on the order aggregators and I guess if there is anything else that\u2019s really surprised you. But that seems to be one of the bigger surprises that\u2019s emerged more recently. And you talked about the impact on sort of delivery at Pizza Hut but you also mentioned the Pizza Hut Casual Dining was impacted by this. But are you saying that the order aggregator sort of delivery model would impact Pizza Hut Casual Dining specifically or is this also not going to be an issue for KFC, which also offers similar type meal occasions?","Greg Creed","No, I think it\u2019s clear that right now with the massive discounting just going on, you can get a meal that you would traditionally go out for, delivered to your house at very low price. But as I said, we know these economics are not sustainable. We know they are burning through all this cash. That\u2019s why on the Pizza Hut delivery side, we are experimenting with it. But I think that we feel and we have seen as we have practiced in other markets around the world, eventually these prices go up; when these prices go up, demand wanes. It\u2019s the fact of life. So, we are","watching it; we\u2019re monitoring it; we are doing it on a global basis. We have got our toe in the water. And as you also know, we are testing delivery with Taco Bell in the U.S. So, we\u2019re not just limiting our testing to either KFC or Pizza Hut, we\u2019re also adding some testing with Taco Bell.","Jason West","So, just one follow-up, going back to the store growth outlook and new store performance, it sounds like store performance is holding up reasonably well in the new stores but you also mentioned some closures in some stores that were open a few years ago. I guess can you talk broadly about the portfolio, particularly at KFC if you have pockets of stores that were maybe were opened in regions that were expected to be economically developing that really haven\u2019t come along yet and there may be pockets of large store closures that could really help alleviate some of the comp pressure or is it really not -- the comps really aren\u2019t broken up in that way?","Pat Grismer","There really hasn\u2019t been a significant shift in the mix of closures, as I mentioned earlier in response to Karen\u2019s question whether we are looking at type of trade zone or city tier; I mean there\u2019s some changes around the edges but nothing really meaningfully different. But what is meaningfully different versus prior year is that because of the cumulative effect of three years of underperformance at KFC, we are looking at more closures this year versus last. But the composition is largely in line with what we\u2019ve seen in last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner of UBS. Your line is open.","Keith Siegner","My first question is I just want to tease out a little bit more of this macro versus aggregators issue. So, is the aggregator issue prevalent across all tiers? And let\u2019s just talk KFC for example on this too. Is it present across all tiers? And then maybe to add to that, how is the tier performance doing; are you still seeing tier one and tier two do better; is KFC weakness more concentrated in those three through six? How are those two pieces playing out?","Greg Creed","I don\u2019t think the aggregator impact in China is having a huge impact on our KFC business. I think what we\u2019ve got to do in our KFC business is introduce what I would say is disruptive value and get our positioning much clearer, go on the offense, talk about all the positives, get back to the core products which every time we go back to the core around the world, we know works. So, I don\u2019t believe that is a huge impact on the KFC business. And then as I said on the Pizza Hut business, obviously the aggregators are more active in the higher tier markets than they are in the smaller tier markets. And again from a Pizza Hut perspective, it\u2019s clearly having some impact on our performance along with the macros. But as I said, I think whether they can sustain this discounting to sustain this performance, I think we all believe is very questionable.","Pat Grismer","And Keith, in response to the second part of your question, very similar to last quarter when we look at same-store sales growth across city tiers, the higher-tier cities are performing better. And that\u2019s largely because among the lower-tier cities we have some markets that are very heavily dependent on industry. And industry as you know has been soft in China. And so that\u2019s weighing on consumer confidence and spending in those regions.","Greg Creed","So Keith, I guess if you had to sort of prioritize it, I would say first of all marketing missteps; second, the softening Chinese economy; and third, the impact from malls and aggregators. And obviously, we\u2019re going to take massive action to turn around certainly the marketing missteps that we\u2019ve taken.","Keith Siegner","And then one quick follow-up, Pat. You mentioned earlier the change in Moody\u2019s analysis of your implied debt in the $2 billion of extra capacity. Is it safe to assume that you leverage this that you tap into that capacity and if not, why not?","Pat Grismer","We have not. However, as I mentioned earlier, we look at our capital structure holistically. So, we consider a number of different things before making a decision to take on more debt as an example. Last year, we increased our borrowings through our short-term credit facility. So, we are certainly not averse to doing that. But we look at these things holistically and we\u2019ll provide a further update at our December investor conference in how we are thinking about this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass","First, if I could just go back to the KFC and draw the dotted line in sales between the 31% increase you experienced, let\u2019s say, ending in mid-August, and the 9% in September, was that a linear deceleration; did it happen all at once to around for example, I think the devaluation happened around then? And are you -- how did September trend; where are we in that continuum now just to get the expectations right for the fourth quarter?","Pat Grismer","John, first of all, the 31% was a division number. So, that was not a KFC number. And I\u2019m not going to give brand-specific numbers around those data points. But you\u2019ll have to bear in mind what we were lapping from last year and the overall shape of that as is the case any time we experience some event, which is the impact is sharpest at the beginning and then it begins to diminish over time. And so the reverse applies to when you are lapping that. So, you have the easier compares in the early weeks following the event. And then those compares become tougher. And I would say that generally follows the shape of our expectations into the fourth quarter.","John Glass","So when you -- so just to be very clear, when there was an event like the devaluation that did not abruptly slow sales, it wasn\u2019t a specific macro event you saw that bent that curve for example?","Pat Grismer","Well, what we did see was in the last one to two weeks of August in China, I think we\u2019ve all read about what were very significant events. Remember it was in mid-August that the currency was devalued quite significantly and a surprise to everybody. And it was less than two weeks later that there was a significant change in the stock market which again was unprecedented and caught everybody by surprise. And that does coincide with when we saw a material change in the shape of Pizza Hut Casual Dining same-store sales. And just to remind you also, the impact of ForEx, apart from the impact that it had to our business in China, very significant impact to our earnings per share 1 to 2 points in the quarter and full ForEx impact of more than 6 points on the year.","John Glass","And then Greg, could I just ask, what is the right timeframe to look at this recovery? You\u2019ve got a new CEO in place. Are we going to hear next quarter that look it\u2019s going to take some time to rebuild the product pipeline and how much of this will be revolved or resolved with pricing? How much of this is maybe resetting pricing or is that not what you are really contemplating as this recovery takes shape?","Greg Creed","No John, as I speak to Micky, and I -- as you can probably imagine, I\u2019m speaking to Micky an awful lot. The discussion we\u2019ve had is that there are some clearly proven ideas that we\u2019ve had success around the world, whether it\u2019s box meals for lunch, day of the week specials, product innovation, and he is in the process of putting all of that into test into China as quickly as he can. So I think that in December, what we\u2019ll be able to do is give you an update, a much clearer update of the things that we\u2019ve taken that have been successful around the world that we\u2019ve put into China with a KFC or Pizza Hut. We will hopefully have some preliminary numbers, even if they are just early test market days. And I think we\u2019ll also have the overlap benefit. So, the way I look at it is a lot of proven things about to go into test in China. They include disruptive value so the equivalent of the $5 box meals; the $20 dinner meals, as well as product innovation around core. So, we\u2019re probably going to have more tests going on in the fourth quarter in China than we\u2019ve seen in a long time in China. And I believe that Micky will be able to give us an update, some progress on those tests when he presents at the December conference.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Westra of Stifel. Your line is open.","Paul Westra","I know you don\u2019t want to give too much color on the outlook for \u201816, but my question is how lasting should we think about what your implied fourth quarter combined China margins could be? And I guess Pat, your full year China profit growth guidance of high to mid-single-digit implies a fourth quarter profit number that might be slightly above $100 million which represents a 65% drop in profits from your actual third quarter performance that\u2019s about double what it normally is historically. And frankly the cause of that drop is not really coming from the top line miss, because your fourth quarter comp guidance pretty much matches your third quarter comp miss, at least for us on the sell side. So at least on paper, given that math, it seems as though Pizza Hut Casual Dining\u2019s profitability is almost being wiped out here in the fourth quarter. Assuming these numbers are even remotely close, are there massive turnaround investments planned for fourth quarter? And if not, are there contingency plans at least in place, so that this margin degradation doesn\u2019t flow too much into next year?","Pat Grismer","You\u2019ve asked two questions, so I\u2019ll respond to them in turn. First with respect to 2016 outlook, it\u2019s premature and we\u2019re not going to give any guidance on 2016, other than as I said in my prepared remarks, our overall goal is to get our whole business back on track, and we\u2019ll provide more specific plans around that and set expectations at our investor conference in December. Specifically with respect to China\u2019s fourth quarter profit outlook, you\u2019ll have to remember that the fourth quarter is one of the lowest seasonal times of the year. So absolute profits historically for China have been very low, whereas -- relatively low, whereas the third quarter is the peak summer season when profits are relatively high. So, it\u2019s not fair to draw those sorts of comparisons between Q3 and Q4 on an absolute basis. But the outlook we\u2019ve given for China Division profit performance for the full year takes full effect of what we\u2019ve guided by way of same-store sales growth for both KFC and for Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China and the corresponding impacts to their levels of profitability bearing in mind that it\u2019s a low seasonal period for the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is open.","David Tarantino","First, Pat, could you give us some perspective on what KFC was cycling in the month of September, so we have a good understanding of how to frame up the plus 9% comp? And then I have a follow-up.","Pat Grismer","We didn\u2019t provide monthly comps last year. And I don\u2019t know that it would be necessarily helpful to do that at this stage.","David Tarantino","My real question has to do with the KFC business. And I guess if I look back to the business since the 2012 supplier incident and following this most recent one in 2014, it doesn\u2019t look like the traffic has really rebounded much following either of those incidences. So, I guess the question is, do you think you\u2019re seeing a step change in the transaction counts that just represents a lower base from which you\u2019ll have to grow going forward or do you see something in your consumer metrics that would suggest an outsized recovery or an outsized rebound is really possible at this stage? Because I guess the trend-line would suggest it\u2019s more of the former than the latter. So, I was just curious to hear your thoughts on that.","Pat Grismer","David, the one thing we are sure of is that the business is going to fully recover over time. We can\u2019t be precise about the exact timing of that. It is very difficult to call and there\u2019s no denying the fact that the shape of the recovery today is weaker than we had previously expected. But we do have good evidence of the recovery in terms of both absolute transaction counts and how they have improved from last year\u2019s event and consumer -- key consumer metrics or brand perception metrics which have improved versus a year ago. So, we do have different indications that substantiate our view that the recovery is continuing and remain confident in the long-term that we will fully recover those transactions.","Greg Creed","I would just add that as I talk to the brands around the world and I look at the businesses around the world where KFC or Pizza Hut or Taco Bell are successful, we\u2019ve got a very good value platform as part of our brand offering. And I think it would be fair to say that we probably should have played and could have played value and I don\u2019t mean at the expense of margin, because we know how to do both. And that\u2019s why, as I said earlier, Micky is taking proven things like the box meals for lunch and the day of the week specials that we\u2019ve run very successfully, particularly in the markets that we continue to do well in, Australia, Japan, South Africa, Russia. So, you will see us play more disruptive value. And you will see us be much clearer around our brand positioning, always original, always Chinese. So, I do believe that those will help our transaction growth, both as we enter the fourth quarter and obviously next year.","So, let\u2019s be honest. We have an incredibly strong brand. It\u2019s really up to us. We know that this is a retail business and we know how to get consumers to respond. So, we\u2019re going to do all the things that we know we\u2019d do when we do it, they\u2019ll respond and it will work. And as I said, the discussions that I\u2019m having with Micky are all around that fact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Joseph Buckley","Based on number of the comments, it sounds like you think your brands in China are lagging the overall industry. Would you comment about that; is that the case; what do you think is going on with the restaurant industry as a whole in China?","Greg Creed","Sorry, I missed -- I actually missed -- can you just repeat the question, Joe? Sorry.","Joseph Buckley","Sure, I\u2019m sorry. Let me pick up the handset. The comments you\u2019ve made about your brands in China, it sounds like you think you are lagging the overall industry in China. And I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s the case. And what you think is going on with the restaurant industry as a whole in China compared to your sales results? And then I have one more please.","Greg Creed","It\u2019s not as easy in China to get an accurate picture of the category or the market like it is in Australia or the U.S. or the UK. So it is difficult to get an absolute number. Look, there is no doubt that we are the number one QSR brand in KFC and the number one casual dining brand in Pizza Hut. And as I said earlier, both our research and independent research suggests that the brands are still in incredibly strong positions. As I said, I do think we can tighten up the positioning; I do think we need more core product innovation; we do need more disruptive value. So, I think all of those things which are things that Micky and I are working on, we need to put in place in order to take advantage of the strong brand positioning that we\u2019ve got.","Joseph Buckley","And then I\u2019m going to sneak two into one for this question. Could you share checking traffic metrics for the quarter in China? And then my other question is, as we look at some of the costs in China that are contributing to this great margin performance, the labor costs per store have been down pretty significantly and that\u2019s in nominal terms, probably down even more in real terms, assuming labor costs inflation is still there. Is there -- should we be concerned that the cost management is so tight there that it might be crimping the ability to get sales recovery?","Pat Grismer","Joe, we absolutely do not believe that the significant productivity initiatives undertaken by the China team are impacting the customer experience. We have very clear measures that we use to assess how the customer experience is improving and we don\u2019t see impact to that. We are delighted with the significant productivity initiatives undertaken by the team.","We mentioned on the last call that there were a variety of things they were doing to drive improved labor efficiency. We have seen those gains sustained and that is driving the result you\u2019re seeing in terms of cost per labor hour.","Greg Creed","Joe, just to build on that, I think the scores that we get suggest that we have not impacted the customer experience but equally, Roger Eaton spent a week in China as the COO, touring a lot of stores. And then, obviously Micky has also been out in a number of the markets in a number of the tiers also visiting the stores. And his feedback or both their feedback to me was, this is not impacting the customer experience. So, I think given Roger -- having been the world-class operator and now running the KFC brand and Micky, their first hand experience gives me confidence that I can trust the numbers that we are getting, which is that we are not impacting the customer experience.","So, I think there is this -- it\u2019s interesting coming from either two what you call high labor markets, certainly Australia, probably a very high labor market in the U.S., there has always been this thing that when labor is cheap, you tend to use too much. And I am not the world-class operator, but that\u2019s sort of been my observation. So, I think what we are doing is we are using mature what I\u2019d call mature market productivity. And this was something that Roger really championed as the COO which was to take all the learnings from markets like Australia where minimum wages are like $17, $18, and apply the same rigor even though the labor is cheap to apply the absolute same rigor transactions per labor hour and all this sort of stuff that he has brought to China. So, I\u2019m confident we\u2019re doing all the right things; I\u2019m very confident we are not negatively impacting the customer experience based on these productivity gains.","Steve Schmitt","And Joe, the first question you asked -- this is Steve, around the mix of the comp transactions for the division were down about 3 points. So, we got about 5 points combined from pricing and mix benefit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Karen Short","I just want to try to understand something, so I guess I\u2019m hearing two comments that I guess I think are somewhat contradictory. I think you seem to believe that the higher margin structure in China is sustainable but also have indicated that you need to have a greater focus on value, both at KFC and Pizza Hut. So, I\u2019m wondering if you could just maybe give a little color on those, both?","Greg Creed","I think from a -- I\u2019ll talk about it from a brand and marketing perspective. I\u2019ll use two examples; obviously, one is Taco Bell. We have the lowest average prices and probably the highest margins. But the second one and more relevant one would be a market like KFC Australia. In KFC Australia, we have average unit volumes around $2.3 million. This year, our sales growth is about 9%. We are obviously in a very high labor market, but yet we\u2019ve got margins in the high-teens. And so, we leverage obviously the sales that we\u2019ve got; we are very smart around how we put these box meals and these day of the week specials together. We\u2019ve become a lot more sophisticated around our pricing metrics and analysis on how to execute. And even in the box meals, driving a lot of drink into the box meals actually improves the perception of the box meal but also improves the margin.","So, I think we\u2019ve got clear brand positioning. We know and we\u2019ve demonstrated in markets like Australia that we can have disruptive value and high-teen margins. And I think that Micky is taking all that knowledge and applying that to the China business.","Steve Schmitt","And the other thing I would say Karen just to build what Greg has said is that we know that the biggest driver of margin improvement for China long-term, to get us back to the 20% range which we still believe is a reasonable target and will be achieved is transaction leverage in the business. Because you have to bear in mind the extent of the transaction losses of the last couple of years. And so as we restore average unit volumes to where they were in 2012 which will happen at some stage then there\u2019s significant upside in the business. And I would say even more so in light of all of the significant productivity gains that the team has delivered over the last couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles","Most of my questions were asked, but Pat, can you just give the pushes and pulls in the China margins that you\u2019ve provided in the past?","Pat Grismer","Certainly; very happy to do that. So, as you know, margins improved by about 5 percentage points for the quarter, productivity drove about 3.5 points of margin improvement, and then our pricing actions in the quarter drove about another 2.5 margin points. Offsetting that was inflation, which shaved off a 1.5 margin and then the transaction decline as Steve referenced, which took off about another point. And then we had about 1 point of benefit from other things, including lapping an inventory provision from last year.","Andrew Charles","Was the productivity really related to labor?","Pat Grismer","Yes.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Greg, I guess with the backdrop of the 90% plus franchise model around the rest of the world that you talked about, clearly I think people appreciate the high margin annuity stream of royalty income that generates. And being that Greg you came from Taco Bell had that stability, I\u2019m just wondering whether you could talk, at least holistically rather than any plans you might have or would ever consider but if you could refranchise the entire China business or the China portfolio today, it would still allow you to kind of participate in China and participate in the growth. But what would be the pros and cons? I mean it just seems like the China volatility just remains so outsized and the franchise model is so much appreciated, I\u2019m just wondering how you size up the pros and cons if you were able to do something like that.","Greg Creed","Well, Jeff, it was a nice try. I think that as you know, as you said, outside of China and India, we are currently 90% franchised; we are moving to 95%. As I said earlier, I think that our key objective or my key objective is to take three global brands and make them global iconic brands with all the things that we\u2019ve talked about. And then I think the decision about whether we run them or we put them in the hands of a franchisee is really not what this is all about. The value is really in the value of the three brands. So, obviously if you -- to hypothetically answer your question, the cons are that you would lose leverage, but the pro is that everything the franchisee pays for and you get a fee. So, I think there\u2019s nothing new around why you would franchise or why you wouldn\u2019t franchise. And that\u2019s why as I said earlier, my focus is on getting the brands in all the countries, improving in their performance, making them iconic, and doing all the things that I\u2019ve talked about that I know we need to do and I know that we can do in order to get this thing. But in any case, as I said, we obviously consider all alternatives. And the focus right now is on getting this business back on track.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney of Hedgeye Risk Management. Your line is open.","Howard Penney","I have two questions. The first one is when you were going through your three-quarter routine whatever that may be, did you think the stock was going to be down and did you think it was going to be down as much as it is? And then the second question is on the China strategy. I understand you laid out the case if you will for China and why you want to continue to grow in China -- not that you can\u2019t continue to grow in China. But it sort of feels like and I apologize for this analogy because I can\u2019t think of a better one kind of a [indiscernible] China-shop strategy in the sense that the economy has gone from 10% to 7% to 6%, and probably going to 3%. And you\u2019ve got volatility in currency and the stock market causing volatility to your business. Do you have an internal economist or somebody that is guiding you on what\u2019s going to happen in China for the next five years in saying the economy is going to go from 6% to 9% or -- I still don\u2019t understand -- I understand the consuming class is growing in China, but I guess I don\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t heard from you a reason why ownership and owning those assets in China is still the right way to go. Because it feels like China is headed in one direction and yet you are going in another.","Greg Creed","Why don\u2019t I have a first crack at it? Obviously I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen to the share price. If I could predict that, I\u2019d be a very wealthy man. So, I\u2019m going to leave that to others to do.","I think on the question of what\u2019s happening in China, look, we are in 126 countries around the world. And in these 126 countries, we have either growth, no growth; lots of competition, no competition. I mean, value is important and there is so many permutations and combinations. I think in China, we\u2019ve still got growth in China that\u2019s still greater than it is in most of the markets we operate.","We do believe that the consuming class will go from about 300 million people to 600 million people by 2020. And whilst we can certainly look at the competitiveness of the China market compared to a few years ago, if I compare that to the competitiveness of the market in the United States, it\u2019s not even close. So, I\u2019m still bullish on China. I still believe it\u2019s a place that we can get significant growth both for ourselves and for our shareholders. And I think we are still on the ground floor of what is a huge opportunity. How we take advantage of that opportunity. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll decide over time. But the most important thing is to position these two brands to capture all the potential growth that we can.","Pat Grismer","And Howard, just to build on that, I think what you are highlighting is the difference between a short-term perspective and a long-term perspective and we\u2019ve always taken a long-term perspective on our business. And our thesis on China and its long-term growth potential is unchanged, notwithstanding the significant volatility we\u2019ve seen in the market and that our brands have experienced in the last couple of years. Because I mentioned we do take a close look at investment returns. Our paybacks on -- our cash paybacks on new units remain in the range of three to four years. It\u2019s an attractive investment return opportunity for our shareholders.","And, as Greg mentioned, our focus is on continuing to drive significant improvements in the business. We have new leadership in place to help deliver that. And so we remain optimistic for the long-term. And as we\u2019ve said many times over, despite the challenges we\u2019ve experienced, we wouldn\u2019t trade places with anybody. We have leading brands in the world\u2019s largest growing economy and we are on the ground floor of growth.","Howard Penney","So, if you don\u2019t mind, can I just try asking the same question again? So, the China economy has gone from -- the last four years, call it beginning of 2012 from 10%, I don\u2019t have these numbers right from 10% to 6%. And you\u2019ve opened 3,000 units over the same timeframe and your stock has gone nowhere. And if the China economy goes from 6% to 3% and you open up 3,000 units, are you going to be able to turn -- with the economy declining at an accelerating rate, are you going to be able to turn this business around in that environment?","Greg Creed","I mean, the way I would answer is we\u2019ve had two incidents, two massive incidents in China, which obviously we are still recovering from. We\u2019ve got a new leader in place who as I said has a fresh perspective and who knows what proven ideas have worked in other parts of the world for both KFC and Pizza Hut. He is already and the team there are already starting to put a lot of that into test, and we\u2019ll continue to do more of that in the fourth quarter and going forward. And I think that when we get to December, we\u2019ll be able to update you on just the progress that those tests are making. We won\u2019t have a massive sort of result changes in a revolutionary sense, but I do believe the huge -- the sheer amount of testing that is now going to happen in China, and the process and the discipline that we are reapplying to that testing in China, I look forward to being able to present with Micky to everybody in December.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Barbula of JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","It\u2019s John Ivankoe. I think you just touched on this in the previous question, but I wanted to get a sense of how Micky was really going to run the business differently than Sam. Certainly, Sam would\u2019ve told us years ago, sharpening the focus of the brands is something that he probably would\u2019ve always done. And I think it would have been assumed by everyone on the call that the idea that China was putting in products made for the Chinese consumer that were proven successful elsewhere in the world, would have always been done, not just in the past three years, but probably in the last 15 years. So what I wanted to get a sense and Greg, I guess you\u2019d probably be the best person to answer this is, how much really is going to tactically change with Micky running the market versus Sam running the market? Not just from a tactical product development and brand focus point of view but even how the China market is managed and structured. In other words, are we a little bit too early to be talking about a complete reorganization in terms of who does what in the organization? And do you think that\u2019s something that in fact should be executed in the relatively near-term?","Pat Grismer","I think Micky has been on the ground for less than six weeks. I mean he came over with us after the Sam retirement announcement. And he has stayed there. So, he and I have obviously been in constant contact. So the first thing is obviously he is looking at the business through new eyes. I think that\u2019s the most important thing. That\u2019s what you always get when you get a new leader. Secondly, whether the business is performing good, bad or indifferent, there\u2019s always unfinished business to look at. I do think that the always original positioning around KFC that Micky has led around the world, we are going to bring to China with a tweak of always original, always Chinese. I think the discussions I\u2019ve had with him around we probably need to simplify the menu, get more focus back on the core products introduce this disruptive value that\u2019s worked elsewhere. And I think in a brand positioning sense, play more offense.","So, I would say that look, it is really early days. I\u2019d probably -- he and I are in constant dialogue. But he has new eyes. He\u2019s got seasoned professional eyes. And so he sees the business as he\u2019s looked through the businesses that have performed elsewhere. We know we\u2019ve got unfinished business. We know we have to make the positioning clearer. We both believe we need more disruptive value, and we have to start playing offense when it comes to brand positioning; all of that.","John Ivankoe","And with respect, Greg, I mean that sounds like the kind of things that a CMO would do or perhaps the president of the brand would do but the CEO job for the CEO of China -- the job, the scale, the responsibilities is -- it\u2019s much bigger than marketing and positioning. So, if you could talk about the organization, how it\u2019s run, what the responsibilities are, how it\u2019s structured, what have you?","Greg Creed","As I said, his job right now is turning around the business. So, I don\u2019t care whether he\u2019s the president, the CEO, the CMO or whoever he is. He and I both realize that what we\u2019ve got to do is turn around the sales and transactions of this business. And so, those are the roles that he has really focused on in his first whatever 30 or 40 days that he\u2019s been there. He and I pretty much talk almost every day.","Now, will we get to structure in China? And does he have the right structure? And has he got the right people? Look, we\u2019ve got a seasoned leadership team there that has a new leader that\u2019s looking at the business through new eyes. And I think you can call it whatever you want to call it, but I think he\u2019s doing all the right things. And certainly the feedback I\u2019m getting from the other team in China is that they think he\u2019s doing all the right things. And certainly the things that I know he is putting into test, he has my full support on. In fact, those are the things that he and I talk about pretty much on a daily basis. So, getting sales and transactions turned around is his number one priority.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy of Morningstar. Your line is open.","R.J. Hottovy","One final follow-up question on brand positioning and I respect that you can\u2019t give away all the internal metrics that you used to measure brand\u2019s strength. But I was wondering if you could give us a little of at least direction or color on what metrics and what gives you confidence that the brand perception hasn\u2019t diminished in China? I think that would be particularly helpful.","Greg Creed","I think a lot of the customer metrics that we measure are obviously making progress since the two supplier incidents. I think the one that we have not made the progress on that we need to make progress on is value. So, I think that as the economy turns, as the macros become tougher, and your value score is the one that\u2019s probably lagging in a recovery sense, I think it indicates that we need to play disruptive value more aggressively. But I want to reassure everybody not at the expense of margin because we do know how to do this and we\u2019ve done it successfully in many other markets. So, do we continue to improve our metrics on food safety, favorite QSR brand, trustworthy all of our brands? Yes, we do. But on value for money, we clearly have a lot more work to do.","So, any more questions?","Steve Schmitt","Thanks R.J.","Greg Creed","So, I want to thank everyone for being on the call. I think it goes without saying we\u2019ve obviously had a very disappointing quarter. And as I said, I and we and everyone at Yum! take responsibility for it. I think what I don\u2019t want you to do is count us as out. We will come back. And as I said earlier, this is really up to us to execute. We know what we\u2019ve got to do. We\u2019ve got to have very clear brand positioning. We have got to have innovation that is driven from insides. We\u2019ve got to have disruptive value. We\u2019ve got to be strong and great in the whole social mobile digital space. We\u2019ve got to upgrade our assets. And we\u2019ve got to deliver a superior customer experience. We know what we have to do. What we all know we have to do is execute better than we\u2019ve done.","The long-term potential for this business is huge whether it\u2019s emerging markets, developed markets, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is. We have three great brands. We are going to turn these into three great global iconic brands and take advantage of all the emerging opportunities that exist for us.","So, it\u2019s on us. Yes, there\u2019s some macro headwinds and yes other things happening, but at the end of the day, around the world, I know what we have to do to be successful. In a number of the markets where we do that, we are incredibly successful. What we\u2019ve got to do is not just do it in a number of markets; we\u2019ve got to do it in every market including China in which we participate.","And I can absolutely assure you, everybody at Yum! knows we have disappointed you and our shareholders this quarter and this year, and we are going to come back stronger and better than ever. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22814":["Yum! Brands, Inc.

Artie Starrs, Pizza Hut U.S. President, will be presenting on June 20 at the Oppenheimer 18th Annual Consumer Conference in Boston, Massachusetts.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Yum! Brands delivered first quarter system sales growth of 4% in constant currency, including 1% same-store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth. Consistent with our expectations, core operating profit growth for the first quarter was flat, and we are maintaining all aspects of our full year 2018 guidance.","As a reminder, our full year core operating profit guidance of approximately flat includes 6 to 7 percentage points of headwind from the timing impact of refranchising and associated G&A savings, along with 2 to 3 percentage points of headwind from the revenue recognition accounting standard.","Regarding our transformation initiatives, this quarter marks the start of the second full year of our transformation journey. And I am pleased to report we remain on track with our efforts to ensure Yum! is a more focused, more franchised and more efficient company. We've discussed that part of this transformation journey is to accelerate growth by focusing on four key drivers: distinctive, relevant and easy brands; unmatched franchise operating capability; bold restaurant developments; and unrivaled culture and talent.","I'll talk to you about distinctive, relevant and easy brand and unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will follow up with unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development. I'll begin with some examples of how our brands are becoming more distinctive, relevant and easy.","At KFC, system sales grew 6% with same-store sales growth of 2% and net new unit growth of 4%. Internationally, same-store sales grew 2%. The executive leadership team and I recently traveled to Russia and Turkey. And I was impressed with the strong leadership and powerful in-store culture in both countries.","Turkey, with first quarter same-store sales growth of 10% and a two year stack of 27%, has embraced the idea of building sales overnight and brand over time by going back to the basics and executing them well. Our local franchisees have invested in their team members, ensuring they are properly trained and designed the menu to drive velocity around core menu items. Turkey also has had some great new unit growth, opening 23 gross units over the last 12 months.","In India, first quarter same-store sales growth grew 10%, marking their eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. India's success is supported by their focus on three key occasions: snacking; weekend groups; and delivery. In addition, by using both digital and TV to advertise value, the market has grown transactions. And like Turkey, India has also growth their assets base, opening 50 gross new units over the last 12 months. These two markets are examples of why we continue to believe KFC has significant runway for growth.","In the U.S., with flat same-store sales growth in the first quarter, our first female Colonel, Reba McEntire, introduced consumers to Smoky Mountain Barbecue, an innovative flavor profile added to our extra crispy chicken. The innovation has continued into the second quarter with the launch of our new sandwich platform, the Crispy Colonel, which gives customers the option of enjoying a classic version of the sandwich or adding our delicious flavor profiles including Nashville Hot, Georgia Gold and Smoky Mountain Barbecue to the Extra Crispy fillet. We are excited about these new and innovative offerings and believe they are what we need to successfully sustain our long-term momentum and drive this business forward.","Before I wrap-up KFC, I want to address our UK business, which suffered a setback this quarter as a result of disruptions in supply when we changed distribution partners. Despite the challenges, the team worked with our new partners, leveraged our culture and rose to the occasion, truly all hands on deck, working around the clock and countless hours to correct the issue, even responding with clever advertising in the brand's unique voice.","I would like to take a second to say thank you to our franchisees and our local team, as our progress to-date could not have been accomplished without their collaborative spirit and hard work. Encouragingly, the customers are responding to our efforts in a very positive manner. As of today, all 871 restaurants are open for their normal hours. Approximately one-third of the restaurants are up and running with the former supplier and the remaining two-thirds of the restaurants are successfully receiving product from the new supplier. As we recover from the incident, clearly, we are applying our lessons learned to ensure this does not happen anywhere else in the world.","Now to Pizza Hut, in the U.S., system sales grew 2%, with same-store sales growth of 4%. While net new units declined 2% compared to prior year, encouragingly, unit development was flat sequentially.","Consistent with what I've said before, the turnaround of the brand in the U.S. will be a gradual build. However, we continue to see positive momentum as a result of the Transformation Agreement and focus on being hot, fast and reliable. Our investment in digital, operations, advertising and delivery drivers, is paying off with improvements in internal operating metrics, including online conversion and delivery times.","In February, we announced we are now the official sponsor of the NFL and we are proud of the way the team has kicked off this partnership at last week's draft. In tandem with being the official sponsor of the NCAA, Pizza Hut now owns the full weekend from Thursday to Monday, providing us even more opportunity to put the fan at the center of everything we are doing.","At Pizza Hut International, system sales grew 2% as a result of continued strong net new unit growth of 5%. Our solid unit growth has resulted from the benefit of the division realignment we undertook several years ago, resulting in dedicated brand leadership teams as well as new partners who possess our three Cs of a healthy franchisee, being capable, capitalized and committed. For these reasons, we remain confident unit growth will sustain a healthy rate.","That said, Pizza Hut is a global iconic brand, and the recent same-store sales results are simply not acceptable. While we are seeing pockets of strength, such as seven consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth in India, we understand we have a lot of work to do to turn sales around.","Specifically, we are taking the following three steps in each of our markets. First is ensuring we have strong operations and digital execution in place to deliver on speed, taste and ease. Second is making sure we are offering compelling value. And third is consistent communication of our For The Love of Pizza brand positioning. We are diligently working to implement these steps at each of our international markets and will update you as we progress.","Now to Taco Bell, where system sales grew 4%, with 1% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. In the U.S., we successfully lapped an 8% same-store sales growth in the first quarter of last year, due in large part to the very successful launch of Nacho Fries. Everything about this product was innovative, from the Web of Fries faux movie trailer to the Mexican seasoning and Nacho Cheese sauce.","Even better, customers could enjoy our praiseworthy Nacho Fries for only $1. Selling more than 53 million orders in the first five weeks, Fries were part of one of every four customer's orders. And as a result of this success, we extended their limited-time offering into April.","Following Fries in the second quarter is the $1 Triple Melt Burrito and Nachos, featuring our seasoned beef alongside melted cheddar, mozzarella and pepper jack cheese, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla or over crispy nachos. These products are another example of delivering value without compromise, a delicious offering for only $1.","Internationally, we are seeing great momentum and are on plan to set a record for the number of net new unit openings. I recently visited my hometown of Brisbane, also home to the first Taco Bell in Australia, and I'm excited to see the restaurant is off to a flying start. The franchisee is very encouraged by this success and is planning to aggressively expand in the country, making Australia a market to watch for future growth.","In addition, we continue to see success in our other priority markets through rapid expansion in Brazil, innovative menu items in Canada and the launch of U.S. innovations in India. And we are wrapping up our first international owners forum in the UK, bringing together global Taco Bell leadership and franchisees to share best practices from across the world, leveraging our scale. I'm excited for the potential of this brand internationally and know we are taking the right steps to move the brand forward.","Lastly, as part of making our brands distinctive, relevant and easy, I'd like to provide you with an update on our partnership with Grubhub. We remain very enthusiastic about our opportunity with Grubhub. And I'm even more pleased that our franchisees are fully supportive and excited about their potential with delivery through Grubhub.","One of the unique aspects of the agreement is to have the POS at all KFC and Taco Bell restaurants fully integrated with Grubhub, which will significantly aid the accuracy of the order and the speed of delivery.","As our teams work to complete this integration, we are testing with Grubhub in a few select KFC and Taco Bell markets and are encouraged by initial results. We look forward to updating you more as the integration is completed and Grubhub is available nationwide.","Now, moving on to unrivaled culture and talent, I strongly believe that our unrivaled culture and talent fuels our results, that our employees must reflect the global marketplace where we operate. That's why we've made a commitment to advance more women into leadership and achieve greater gender parity in senior leadership globally by 2030.","This new commitment aligns with the Paradigm for Parity coalition, a movement of Fortune 500 CEOs, senior business leaders and academics who are committed to achieving a new norm in corporate leadership, one in which women and men have equal power, status and opportunity.","It also builds upon Yum! Brands becoming one of more than 100 companies in 10 sectors named to the inaugural 2018 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, where Yum! was recognized and measured for gender equality across internal company statistics, employee policies, external community support and engagement, and gender-conscious product offerings. I'm very proud of our initiatives around a diverse and inclusive work environment and know this enhances Yum! as a great place to work.","In summary, the second full year of our transformation journey is well underway. And I'm pleased with our progress towards delivering A World with More Yum! I remain confident in our four growth drivers as we lay the foundation for long-term growth that results in increased returns for our shareholders.","And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss: our first quarter results; progress towards our transformation initiatives; and two of our four growth capabilities, bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capabilities.","To begin, our first quarter results, consistent with our expectations, core operating profit growth was flat as a result of headwinds related to the timing mismatch between refranchising and the associated G&A savings and the revenue recognition accounting standard. As Greg mentioned, we remain confident in achieving all aspects of our full year 2018 guidance.","This includes approximately flat core operating profit growth, which incorporates headwinds of 6 to 7 percentage points related to the timing mismatch between refranchising and the associated G&A savings, and 2 to 3 percentage points related to the revenue recognition accounting standard. To clarify, the level of unit openings is typically higher in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we anticipate the impact of the revenue recognition accounting standard to be more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter.","First quarter EPS, excluding Special Items, was $0.90, an increase of $0.25. Included in this is $0.16 related to our recently-closed investment in Grubhub. Accounting rules require that we begin reflecting the change in fair value of this investment beginning in the quarter of the deal announcement. And, as a result, we booked $66 million of pre-tax investment income in the first quarter. Note that our commitment to at least $3.75 in 2019 EPS was made prior to the Grubhub investment and our target will continue to exclude any impact to EPS as a result of our quarterly mark-to-market adjustments.","Also impacting our first quarter EPS was our effective tax rate excluding Special Items of 14%. This was lower than our expected rate for the full year due to the timing of stock option exercises. First quarter same-store sales growth of 1% at Yum! and 2% at KFC were impacted by the supply interruptions in our KFC UK business. Adjusting for the impact of this, we estimate Yum!'s same-store sales growth would have been 2% and KFC's same-store sales growth would have been 3%. Additionally, we estimate an approximately 3% impact to Yum!'s core operating profit and an approximately 5% impact to KFC's core operating profit in the first quarter.","As Greg mentioned, our local management team and franchisees collaborated and worked tirelessly to get us back on track. And our customers are responding positively as the business continues to recover. The impact of full-year same-store sales growth is estimated to be 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for Yum! The impact to full-year core operating profit growth is estimated to be 2% for KFC and 1% for Yum! While this is a significant event for our UK market and we are collaborating with our franchise partners to ensure they are set up for success, the limited impact to Yum! demonstrates the power of the franchise model diversified across brands and geographies. As such, we are maintaining our full year guidance, despite the UK supply disruption.","Now, turning to our transformation initiatives, where we remain on track to deliver the key components of our strategy of: at least 98% franchise mix; approximately $100 million in run rate CapEx in 2019; reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales; and 2019 EPS of at least $3.75.","On our journey to achieving at least 98% franchise mix by the end of this year, we refranchised 144 units during the first quarter, including 52 KFC, 43 Pizza Hut and 49 Taco Bell restaurants for current franchise mix of 97% and pre-tax proceeds of $205 million.","As part of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $528 million at an average price of $81. Further, we paid $120 million in dividends at $0.36 per share. Total capital returned was $647 million during the first quarter and nearly $3 billion since the beginning of 2017. We remain committed to returning between $6.5 billion and $7 billion from 2017 to 2019.","I'm also excited to share some good news regarding the financial markets' continued support of our business transformations and capital market strategies. In April, we successfully re-priced our $1.97 billion Term Loan B, which reduces the interest rate by 25 basis points to LIBOR plus 1.75% and is expected to reduce annual cash interest by approximately $5 million. I'm pleased with the enhancements we are making to our capital structure to further support our target of 5 times EBITDA leverage.","Next, I'd like to discuss two of our four key growth drivers. First, bold restaurant development; at KFC in the U.S., we have remodeled nearly 1,000 restaurants over the last two years, or approximately 25% of the asset base, and remain on pace to make the new American Showman the most prevalent image for KFC in the U.S. by the end of the year.","At Pizza Hut International, we achieved strong net new unit growth of 5%, as Greg previously mentioned. At Pizza Hut U.S., we had flat unit development during the quarter, as we improve on our last three years of unit decline.","Taco Bell continues to grow their units through new asset formats, including the urban walk-in asset and the cantina subset of this, which serves alcohol. The most recent opening in Brooklyn represents our 24th urban walk-in asset and we are excited to see franchisees investing in this asset format. Internationally, Taco Bell opened 11 units this quarter in markets such as Latin America, Japan and the UK.","All-in, during the first quarter, we opened 500 gross units and 239 net new units, representing a step-up in development from our recent historical rates in the first quarter. We are on track for 2018 to be the third consecutive year with a significant ramp-up in the pace of development. We have a growth mindset and are confident there is significant white space for each of our brands through new asset formats in the U.S. and untapped geographies internationally, which will drive net new unit growth over the long-term.","Our next growth driver is unmatched franchise operating capability. Greg and I recently attended the KFC U.S. Franchise Convention and could feel the sense of pride these franchisees have for their restaurants. They are the ones making the culture come alive in their restaurants. And it is this culture which translates into a positive customer experience and fuels our results.","In our Pizza Hut U.S. business, nearly 2,000 stores have changed hands in the last 18 months. This means over one-third of the U.S. traditional restaurants are under new leadership, possessing the three Cs of being a Yum! Franchisee: capable, capitalized and committed. We are confident that, in conjunction with our existing franchisees, we have leaders that are capable of running great restaurants, capitalized to ensure the brand grows, and committed to the brand's strategic objectives.","Last quarter, I highlighted the operational improvements at Taco Bell during our highest growing daypart, after 5:00 p.m. And I'm pleased that customer satisfaction scores further improved over the last quarter, while maintaining speed during the launch of Nacho Fries.","To continue the momentum through summer, Taco Bell has developed a unique after dark program focused on fostering a culture of speed while maximizing satisfaction and delivering world-class service, targeting dinner and late-night peaks.","In conclusion, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the progress we continue to make on implementing our strategic transformation. First quarter underlying base operating profit was solid and core operating profit adjusted for the timing mismatch between refranchising and associated G&A savings and the revenue recognition accounting standard, was as expected. I'm confident we are taking the right steps to optimize shareholder value and our disciplined decisions will set us up for strength in the near and long-term.","Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",". Your first question comes from Matt McGinley of Evercore SI (sic) [ISI].","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Thank you. My first question is on the core operating profit.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Matt, we're just trying to get the volume up a little bit. Hang on. Okay, try again.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Okay my question \u2013 can you hear me now?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. So my question on the core operating profit is for the year, you expected that to be flat overall. You were flat in the first quarter, despite what you called out as a 3 point headwind from the UK. And I would think that as the year progresses, that you would get more of that G&A reduction in the back half.","Other than that revenue recognition change that you'll have, that will probably more negatively impact you in the fourth quarter, what gets worse from a run rate perspective as the year progresses?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","This is David. Let me give you a little sense for how the cadence of operating profit will work during the year, as we get to that flat guidance for the full year. The second quarter will probably be our weakest quarter of the year, as we expect to report negative core operating profit.","I would point out that we're lapping in the second quarter $9 million worth of one-time benefits at KFC, which we called out during last year's second quarter call. So those one-timers are part of the lap and, obviously, present some headwind.","We also have the refranchising impact and the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement spend contributing to that being a tougher quarter lap. And we expect the quarters to get better as the year goes on. When we get to the fourth quarter, we'll be lapping actually the Pizza Hut transformation spend of $15 million in the fourth quarter of last year, so that presents a tailwind for us in terms of reported operating profit growth.","And we're also lapping, you guys will remember from fourth quarter last year, that we refranchised close to 900 units. So that will be taking a toll on us before we get to the fourth quarter, but once we get to lapping it, we will, obviously, won't have as much of a headwind from that.","And then to your point about G&A, it's not as if the G&A reductions build so that they're much bigger in any one quarter. We think that they will occur mostly pro rata during the course of the year, but the G&A obviously is a little bit of a tailwind to the year, but unfortunately more than offset by the impact from refranchising. So that's basically how you build the year to flat.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Thanks for that. And then on the KFC system sales in the UK, and I think I understand the issues that you had there, but are you fully moved past those issues or is there some residual issues you have from a customer standpoint that when you have those closures or the inability to supply product, that the customers don't come back immediately?","Just kind of curious if you're fully moved on from those issues or if this is still a sort of a residual impact into the second quarter.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","No. Obviously, the challenges are to make sure we have full supply in the restaurants and that we ensure that we can get supply there on a timely basis. We're mostly past that and mostly back up and running. But out of an abundance of caution, we're waiting until we're 100% confident before we turn the media back on.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's a key point. Yes, we ran, I thought, a rather clever ad when we were in the middle of the crisis but, obviously, we stopped advertising while we didn't have supply. So I think we're excited to get all 871 restaurants back and we'll be excited to turn on the marketing machine.","I think we'll get a very good response from the customer, who realizes this was a distribution issue. And I think we're going to get a lot of support when we turn the marketing machine back on.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. So the marketing should turn on later in the month. Obviously, the impact of the event was being felt in the first quarter, which we've reported on. And we will see some continued impact into the second quarter as well, also contributing to the second quarter being the worst quarter of the year, most likely.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. On the Pizza Hut International comp decline, first, how much of that was simply due to the China results, which we saw last night, or is it a broader issue, or maybe you could just talk about the markets where you're seeing that and what the specific issues are? And is this a dine-in versus delivery? Is there any kind of way to look at it on those two dimensions strength versus weakness?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","On the actual numbers, I think if you back out China, it's closer to flat for International, but I'll let Greg comment on it.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I think if you look at the numbers and you broke out dine-in versus delivery, the delivery numbers are stronger, obviously, than the dine-in numbers. And, John, it's like everything. When we get value right, when we get product right and we get it hot and fast, we do very well. So I think, as I alluded to in my presentation, we've got three specific actions we're taking. We're going to take those with the markets that need to and, obviously, we're confident that that will improve our performance in same-store sales growth in Pizza Hut International.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, just on the UK, is there some sort of recovery that's available to you? Did you put that into your forecast or would that be upside if there was insurance recovery or some other benefit that you might get from this from the distributor or some other source, insurance company, for example?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Obviously, yes. The parties that were responsible, we've been in discussions with them. And we've reached a settlement. We can't really go into any details on that, but that is baked into our numbers. And that's why, as Greg mentioned in his speech, we think we've helped the franchisees get through this to the point where we can get the business back on track very quickly and get everybody back to a healthy situation.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS.","Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Morning. Thanks for the question. Could you provide a bit more detail on what you're seeing from all the recently-launched initiatives in place at Pizza Hut in the U.S.? I know early stages, but just thinking about loyalty, the thermal pouch, new app, increased marketing spend, Greg, I know you talked about improvements in internal metrics and, obviously, very solid one year trends, but anything else on customer satisfaction metrics, what the franchisees are telling you just as we think about assessing the continued pace of the turnaround? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Sure, Dennis. I think, as you said, obviously, loyalty numbers are growing. We just added more cheese to the pizza, so we're improving the product. Our conversion numbers definitely improved in the quarter. Our speed improved during the quarter. So I think all the things that we're doing, hiring delivery drivers, the hot pouches. So the food is hotter. It's getting there faster. Conversion is stronger. So that's what we're seeing across all of our metrics.","And what's interesting is, as David alluded to, that 2,000 restaurants have changed hands. What we're seeing with some of these new franchisees is some of our new franchisees are actually delivering the best operating metrics. So we're encouraged that as these new franchisees come on board, embrace the strategy and the tactics that Artie's putting in place, that we're actually seeing these new franchisees jump to the top of the operating metric performance.","Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris O'Cull of Stifel.","Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I know you mentioned that KFC and Taco Bell's point-of-sale system will be fully integrated with Grub's. Does this mean the company will have access to the customer data from the Grub orders? And will this integration allow you guys to communicate back to the Grub customers with ordering updates, incentive offers, rewards et cetera?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Obviously, as part of the deal with Grub, we have access to the data. I mean the sense of data is keen about our customers, so we'll have access to -- the Taco Bell customers will have access to the Taco Bell and the KFC will have access to KFC.","So I think, obviously, having access to that data is critical. The teams are focused now on integration. And then, I think what you'll see \u2013 and the third thing, and David alluded to it is, both David and I were at both the KFC and Taco Bell franchise conventions in Q1, which Grubhub presented at both of those conventions. And the response was very positive to the presentations and I think very positive to the long-term relationship we're going to have with Grubhub.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. When your global franchise ownership mix reaches that 98% or so roughly, I guess, over the next coming quarters, where do you expect that consolidated restaurant level margin run rate to settle versus where it is today?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I think on margin, we've been very consistent in saying that the margin can be misleading now, because we own so few company stores. We're at 97% today, so 98% is not that far away.","I think we're at 1,345 company units on our journey to get below 1,000. So, for example, Pizza Hut margin is only represented by 100 stores. We've got over 16,000 stores in the Pizza Hut system; 100 stores don't represent margin at all.","And we're very committed to having this model where we own stores to learn, so we'll do testing in those company stores that may depress margins, and that doesn't bother us at all.","We may own stores in a few markets where we're trying to make market entry. And we want to show our franchise partners that we'll put our capital out in front and invest in those stores to spur development by then.","So I wouldn't give a forecast of where our company margins are going to be, nor would I get too focused on them as they become such a small subset of the overall system. They really don't represent the performance of the business.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And you just touched on it, but of those few hundred-plus units left to refranchise, any color as to where we should expect that refranchising to take place across the divisions?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, obviously, with Pizza Hut down to 100, there's not a lot more left to refranchise there, so, yeah, I can tell you it would be the remaining Taco Bell and KFC brands. But, as you can imagine, we also don't reveal the plans for where we're going to refranchise. Deals fall apart. Deals come together. We want to give ourselves all the flexibility to get to the number the right way.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I think, as David said, we remain really confident that we will get to the 98% and own less than 1,000 restaurants by the end of this year.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great, thank you. You guys are obviously seeing some correlation across disparate Pizza Hut International markets, at least that's what it sounds like in your prepared remarks and also what we can see in some of the tables in your press release.","So, I guess, is there anything that's changing in early 2018? And I know you did make the point that delivery is outperforming dine-in, but hopefully we can go a little bit deeper into that. Firstly, were there any lessons learned from the U.S., especially with dine-in and delivery being two different models that have now converged together, that we can apply to the various international markets? And secondly, if you can remind us what percent of stores internationally currently offer delivery? And can that percent materially tick-up as a way to offset the weaker dine-in sales?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Okay. Well, I'll address the first one, which is what we are learning from the U.S. that we can take internationally. Great value, clearly, I think for all brands and most markets, value remains an imperative and we're obviously focused on that. So great value, great product, in the U.S., we've just announced we're putting more cheese on our products that not only makes it taste better, it also delivers the product hotter because, obviously, more cheese keeps the heat, plus the new pouches. And then I think making sure that we're hot and on time. So I think it's really about just executing the fundamentals and making sure that each of the markets has great value, has a great product and is executing hot and fast.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. As far as the percentage of stores offering delivery, internationally, it's 60%. And just as more color on Pizza Hut, internationally, the Pizza Hut dine-in stores are actually mostly in generally pretty good shape. And we have a lot of markets where the dine-in business is healthy, in contrast to the U. S. So it's not a perfect analogy between what's going on in the U.S. And Pizza Hut, more than our other brands, really does tend to be unique market-to-market, where it's been built up as a delivery brand in one market, a dine-in brand in another, a higher-end dine-in brand in some markets, a more family dining in another. So it's a little bit more complex in terms of how we take learnings from one market to another. However, we think there's a lot of learnings on the digital side. Pizza Hut, with, obviously, many billions of dollars of digital sales in the U.S., is working closely with our international team to take those learnings and make sure we have the best digital experience around the world, as another example of where we're sharing know-how.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And that follow up, I mean, can that 60% be materially higher in terms of stores that offer delivery?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. In fact, as we move forward with Pizza Hut internationally, the Pizza Hut team has done a really nice job of developing what they call their fast casual Delco model or Super Delco. It goes by a number of different names, which has a dine-in component, but also is set up to do delivery the right way.","A big part of this is just getting all of our assets to have a back-of-house that has delivery capability. That's a challenge we still face in the U.S. and that we continue to face internationally. And we know that the more we can lean in on delivery, the better set up for long-term success, the better delivery is doing today, as Greg mentioned. So a big part of this strategy is delivery and digital-centric internationally.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregory Francfort of Bank of America.","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Just a question on the Taco Bell margins, and I know the company stores are not a big piece of the base right now, but a little bit softer this quarter. How much of that was due to the Nacho Fries?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Sure. As you mentioned, we had great margins at Taco Bell but softer on a comparison basis. The launch of Fries was definitely a factor in that. I think the team did the right thing and made sure we staffed up as we launched the product and learned about how we can best operationalize it. And so, that was a big factor in some of the margin impact.","We also had a little impact from refranchising. And then I would remind you that all quarter long, we were on air with dollar value. So we had a number of things pressuring margin a little bit, but still all-in-all in the context of our margins and our long-term guidance, good margins.","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, got it. Thanks. And then, Greg, just how do you think digital ordering plays out over the long-term from a consumer perspective? As a consumer, am I going to have three or four brand apps on my phone? Am I going to have one order aggregation app? I'm just curious what you think the consumer-facing side or mobile device side of the equation will be in a couple years?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I think, first of all, there will be more, obviously, mobile ordering. What's interesting, I was actually at somewhere the other day and I have this bad habit now of looking at people's front page of their phones. And I saw the Pizza Hut app on a lot of phones, right? So I think having got in early with Pizza Hut, I think you'll find the same with Taco Bell and I think we'll also do the same as we get through Grubhub and do business that way.","So I do think orders on mobile will grow. I do think people will have potentially more than one or two apps. They're not going to put every brand that's out there. And I think that's just another reason to make your brand relevant, distinctive, and easy, because I think the brands that offer relevance to the customer, are distinctive in the customers' mind and make it easy to order, easy to pay, easy to get, will be the ones that will either see their app as front page apps.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bernstein.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on Taco Bell and then a question about Grub, please. So, on Taco Bell, you mentioned how successful Nacho Fries were. And I think we had read that stronger even than Doritos Locos, perhaps, at the launch. So, I guess I was a bit surprised comps weren't a bit stronger. Granted, you're lapping an 8% compare, but could you talk about maybe was it just check compression from the dollar menu and the value push or to what extent was that just a function of a difficult comparison versus a daypart or a menu segment maybe not working as well? And then, I do have another question, please.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Sure. Well I think the good news is 25% incidence, a quarter of the orders going out with Fries was great. Obviously, 8% was a tough number to lap, given what's going on in the marketplace. We were happy that we lapped with a plus 1%. Obviously, $1 Fries, part of it is the fact that they're $1, which also helped the business and helped drive incidence. And I think what we like, what we saw was a lot of it was incremental.","So I think that, obviously, probably helped check. It did help check in the quarter. I think the good news is that we're not a one-trick pony when it comes to value. We've got now the Triple Melt Burrito and Nachos in Q2, so we've got a lot of I think \u2013 I'm not sure tricks is the right word. We've got a lot of really smart plays around value. And I believe that we will continue to do very well in this very tough marketplace with a brand like Taco Bell.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then, just the follow-up was on Grubhub. Can you just talk a little bit about the decision to make an investment versus just doing these things through some kind of partnership? Because I know we heard last night from Yum China that they are actually trying to shift more of their ordering to their own platform and a little bit away from aggregators. So I'm just trying to contextualize that in terms of global trends and, again, a decision to sort of tie a partnership closer than just having some sort of contractual agreement.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, obviously, with the pickup in business going to aggregators, this is an opportunity in the industry for us. And we just thought, given our scale and all the knowledge we have about delivery through the Pizza Hut brand, that we had a lot to offer to an aggregator partner. And that's why we wanted to \u2013 but, at the same time, we also wanted to have a front seat with what we think is the best run aggregator and understand their business model and how we could best utilize it and partner together to grow both of our businesses.","So the investment was part and parcel to getting a board seat at Grubhub and we thought it was the right thing to do. Obviously, we're pleased the stock has responded positively and that our investment is up. But it really was more about getting a seat on the board of directors and having a different kind of partnership, other than just commercial terms. We want this to be a partnership where we share more knowledge between the two companies at a deeper level. We're actually planning on going up to visit with them with our senior team in a couple of months, things you wouldn't do if you just had commercial terms between two entities.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I also think that our investment enables Grubhub to expand to gain national distribution quicker. So I think they spoke about they are actually getting into penetrating more markets more quickly. So we like the fact that our money could be directed to helping them do that, because, obviously, the broader the presence of Grubhub, the better it is for us once we get the integration complete.","So I think it's a really good partnership. I think it was a great investment. I think it's great to have the board seat. And I think you will see great things come from this, once we get the integration complete, we put the marketing effort behind it and Grubhub expands their national distribution. I think this is all upside for both parties.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen & Company.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. On the upcoming Taco Bell after dark initiative, how does this tie in to the Grubhub partnership, which presumably should benefit you most at late night? And will the after dark initiative be customer-facing with opportunities to layer in Grubhub marketing to the initiative as you go through the summer?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, I think there is two things going on. First of all, one is operationally what David was talking about was I think applying the focus that we apply to other dayparts to obviously dinner and late night. We do believe there's a huge amount of upside. I think for competitive reasons, we don't want to give too much away on what we're doing after dark from a consumer-facing perspective. That would be not in our best interest, so I'll refrain from that. But I just want to let you know that we are going to \u2013 or the operators will put additional focus on our customer service, our speed of service, our accuracy and all of those key operating metrics for both dinner and late night as we go through the summer.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Next question, please. This will be our last question.","Operator","Your final question comes from David Tarantino of Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. My question's on the unit development, which seems to be picking up momentum. And I was wondering if you could just give us an update on your thoughts on how you get to that level of unit growth that's needed to deliver your goal of 7% system sales growth? And in particular, whether your confidence in getting there has changed following a lot of these refranchising transactions you've completed.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes. I think our confidence is increasing in unit development as we start to put some results up on the board. We mentioned that we had 239 net new units open in the first quarter of 2018. That compares to about 100 less last year so that's 100 unit pickup, about half coming from China, which reported yesterday. And some of you may have noted they took their unit guidance up. They also commented on the great cash paybacks they're getting on KFC and Pizza Hut. So that's all very positive when one of our largest developers is taking their guidance up. We're seeing the actual numbers increase.","And then to your point about the refranchising, as I think we've mentioned in some other calls, we've used the refranchising as an opportunity to make sure we pick well-capitalized franchisees that are committed to growth and then have development agreements typically as part of those refranchising deals.","So our pipeline, as we get more and more of the refranchising done, our pipeline for new unit development is building up with these Development Agreements being put in place. So, yeah, we're really excited. We had a step-up in development in 2017, which you guys would have noted, a couple hundred units versus 2016.","We're looking to do the same thing in 2018. And we're certainly not stopping there. We think this is an important part of the journey to get to 7% is getting a more reliable contribution from development at a higher number than we have in the past.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And, David, if I could just follow up on that, do you think with these refranchising transactions that take a little bit of time for that pipeline to build, I would assume, and do you think we'll see a bigger inflection in 2019 and 2020 than what we've seen last year and this year or is it more going to be a kind of a gradual ramp up?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Maybe as we get to the end of the year, we might start talking about guidance for future years. Certainly it's our hope that we keep ramping up development, but one thing to note is that as we've done the refranchising in the markets where we have equity stores, we've continued to build up our own equity pipeline and then we hand that pipeline to the franchisees.","So we didn't want to have the situation where somebody would buy a market and there would be no development at that point in time. So we've tried to avoid any lulls in development caused by the hand-off of units. But certainly very optimistic about development. It's an area that we're leaning in hard and really proud of the work that the teams in the field are doing to build a stronger and stronger pipeline.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Okay. So first of all, I want to thank you all for being on the call. I guess just a few thoughts in closing. I think a solid start to the year, after adjusting for the impact of KFC UK. It's clear we need to stay focused on making the brands more relevant, distinct and easy to drive even stronger same-store sales performance. And as suggested, we're obviously pleased with the strongest net new unit openings in Q1 in recent history. Thanks, again, and we look forward to speaking to you in August.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"23132":["Yum! Brands, Inc.

Also on today's call is Larry Gathof, Yum!'s Treasurer, and we're very pleased to have Micky Pant, Yum! China CEO on our call as well. Following remarks from Greg and Dave, we'll open the call to questions from the entire team. Please keep in mind, Micky is dialing in from Shanghai, so there could be a slight delay in some of his responses.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands website, www.yum.com to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording. We would like to make you aware of the following upcoming Yum! Investor Event, our second quarter 2016 earnings will be released on Wednesday, July 13.","Now, before I turn the call over to Greg, I would like to bring your attention to two items you may have noticed in yesterday's release. First is new terminology, we reported core operating profit growth of 21% for the first quarter of 2016. Core operating profit growth is our operating profit growth year-over-year, excluding foreign currency translation and special items. Second, as previously announced, effective January of this year, the company's India business integrated its three brands into our global brand divisions. Prior year figures have been restated in the release.","Now, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased we're off to a strong start in 2016, with better than expected core operating profit growth of 21% in the first quarter. This includes 42% growth in our China business due to outstanding Chinese New Year results at KFC, underscoring the power of the KFC brand in China when we deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers. Company-wide, all four of our divisions posted positive same-store sales and operating profit growth in constant currency. Furthermore, we are on track to finalize the spin-off of our China business by year end, creating two powerful independent, focused growth companies. As you saw in our release, we're raising full year core operating profit growth guidance for Yum! Brands to 12% from 10% previously. Even though it is still early in the year, we are confident about the revised guidance, and will update you as the year progresses. Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions, and then Dave Russell, our Interim CFO, will walk you through the financials.","So first China. For the China Division, same store sales grew 6%, led by 12% same-store sales growth at KFC. Our KFC business, as a reminder, represents about 75% of our operating profit in China. We saw particular success at KFC during the Chinese New Year with Bucket Meals, which we tailored across four customer groups, ranging from kid's buckets to larger group meals. As a result, buckets mix had a much higher percentage than normally. This lifted average ticket as we focused more on group occasions. And we gained even more consumer insights this year, which will help our business both going forward as well as next New Year.","Pizza Hut Casual Dining, which represents about 25% of our operating profit in China, remained challenging. System sales declined 1%, and same-store sales declined 12% in the quarter. A tough macro environment and competitive landscape continued to weigh on performance. We're addressing this with urgency, but realize a recovery will take time.","So wrapping up on China, we're pleased with our first quarter's overall operating profit growth, which came in well ahead of our expectations. The strong margin performance reinforces our confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we generate sales growth, profit flow-through is impressive. As Steve mentioned, Micky Pant, our China Division CEO, is on the call today and will be happy to assist in answering questions you may have on the China business.","Now, turning to our three global brand divisions. In our KFC Division, same-store sales grew 1% in the first quarter or 5% on a two-year stack. Operating profit grew 7% in constant currency when adjusting for incremental advertising spend in the U.S. The division opened 79 new international restaurants in 32 countries. 77% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 71% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets. System sales and international developed markets grew 5% and international emerging markets grew 8%.","I recently visited with the team in Canada and was thrilled to see the assets being upgraded and the marketing position around Always Original. With 6% same-store sales growth in the quarter, I would say it's working. I'm also pleased to see success in emerging markets, which are a key contributor to KFC's growth story. KFC is a franchise-led emerging powerhouse, and I'm confident the brand is getting even stronger and will produce strong growth this year and for many years to come.","Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in the quarter, and was led by 5% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. Our $5 Flavor Menu helped drive system transactions, with company stores leading the way, up 8% in the quarter. Our discipline around making it easier to get a better pizza is holistic and driving traffic. We are focused on the entire customer experience, from ordering, payment and delivery tracking, to our assets and menu. And I believe this quarter's results are further testament to our maniacal emphasis on this way of thinking.","We are on track to replace over 1,300 U.S. ovens in 2016. For those stores replacing older ovens, this should result in average energy savings of 25% in ongoing operational costs and a faster cook time. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focusing on balancing premium price innovation, such as Stuffed Garlic Knots Pizza to protect and improve unit level economics with compelling value offerings such as our ongoing $6.99 Any Pairs deal. All of this will enable us to provide our customers with a better pizza at great value.","Our international business at Pizza Hut saw systems sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were especially strong in Latin America and Canada but offset by weaknesses in Korea, Australia, and India. We are committed to offering consistent everyday value to our customers, and will leverage proven value strategies across markets with similar characteristics. We have high expectations for the international Pizza Hut business. Over the last five years, we have opened 1,200 international restaurants, and we will continue to grow this business over time. The bottom line is that we have established solid momentum with our strategy in the U.S., especially around the $5 Flavor Menu. And as we roll this overall strategy out internationally, we hope to achieve similar success.","Now, turning to Taco Bell, same-store sales grew 1%, lapping 6% growth a year ago, and operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Restaurant margins were an impressive 21%. While 1% same-store sales growth is not what we're used to seeing at Taco Bell, the timing of our key launches had an impact on same-store sales growth for the quarter. The Quesalupa, which launched in February, makes it almost 10% and drove a meaningful lift in transactions. We also launched our $1 breakfast menu in March. The $1 price point is consistent with Taco Bell's reputation as the value leader in QSR.","Taco Bell's new breakfast $1 Value Menu differentiates itself from the competitors and puts it at the forefront of value in a growing daypart. We now have 10 $1 items on the breakfast menu, and are seeing breakfast sales hold at 8% and transaction growth accelerating. The Taco Bell team is exhibiting great flexibility to read and react to the competitive value pressures, and adjusted their 2016 promotional calendar accordingly to highlight even more value. Insight-driven innovation, cravable food, and breakthrough value such as the upcoming launches of the $1 Beefy Crunch Burrito and steak value later this year, should boost sales and further the brand's momentum.","So, we're off to a great start at Yum! Over the past several quarters, we have really had three businesses that needed dramatic improvement: KFC China, Pizza Hut China, and Pizza Hut U.S. I'm pleased that we have been able to turn two out of these three businesses, as KFC China and Pizza Hut U.S. are on more solid footing. Now, let's be clear, we're not out of the woods on these businesses, but we've made a lot of progress and will continue to focus on delivering better results. As you heard me say before, this is a transformational year for Yum! as we finalize the spin-off of our China business, creating two powerful, independent focus growth companies. Our brand strength, unwavering focus on the customer, and innovative food offerings driven by consumer insights will allow us to grow Yum! into an even better global company. This is an exciting time and pivotal time for our company, and I look forward to what the future holds.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Dave.","David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover three areas: our first quarter results, our outlook for 2016, and an update on our planned recapitalization and a spin-off of our China business.","As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results where core operating profit increased 21%. EPS before special items grew 19%, including a five-point negative impact from foreign currency. These results were led by better than expected sales and restaurant margins at KFC China. EPS also benefited from a 5% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our first quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months.","I'll now take you through our results by division starting with our China business. For the China Division, overall, same-store sales grew 6% in the quarter. KFC grew same-store sales 12%, which was sequentially better than Q4, and exceeded our expectations. A successful Chinese New Year promotion drove results. As Greg said, the KFC brand in China is really powerful when you deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers. Same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining remain sluggish, declining 12% in the quarter. We are working to turn the Pizza Hut business around in a difficult macro and competitive environment.","Restaurant margin improved 3.5 percentage points versus the prior year to 22.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC, productivity initiatives, and commodity deflations, more than offsetting sales deleverage at Pizza Hut. While our first quarter is a seasonally high sales period for the China Division, restaurant margins of over 22% give us tremendous confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we deliver solid top-line growth, the profits are impressive.","One other note on China's first quarter results, we had a leap year benefit that added an additional $6 million of operating profit in Q1 to China's results. However, we pulled sales from the leap day out of our same-store sales calculation, so the extra day had no impact on our reported 6% same-store sales growth. The way our reporting calendars work here at Yum!, none of our other divisions saw any impact from leap year in Q1.","Now, moving to our global KFC Division, which posted its ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales and profit growth. Emerging and international developed markets, each grew comps 1%. The U.S. recorded its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth despite overlapping 7% comps in the first quarter of last year. Operating margins improved 30 basis points in constant currency, and core operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Adjusting for the incremental advertising expense associated with the Acceleration Agreement we reached with our franchisees in 2015, core operating profit grew 7% in the quarter. As a reminder, the Acceleration Agreement with our U.S. franchisees, which went into effect during the second quarter of last year called for us to invest incremental media of $20 million in 2016 as opposed to $10 million last year.","Our global Pizza Hut Division delivered 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter, led by 5% same-store sales growth on our U.S. business. Same-store sales growth and lower G&A expenses drove core operating profit growth of 9%. This is the best result we've seen on Pizza Hut U.S. in years, and we believe our strategy is working to drive incremental transactions. I am pleased to see momentum behind the business, and believe we can transfer our U.S. learnings to benefit the system globally.","Digital continues to grow in importance to our sales, comprising 46% of U.S. delivery and carryout sales, a three percentage point increase versus a year ago. On Super Bowl Sunday alone, we took over 500,000 digital orders, representing about 50% of sales on what was an all-time record day for the business. With digital orders comes higher levels of loyalty and higher average spend, so we are investing as you would expect. Along those lines, we are making progress in migrating to a single point of sale system in the U.S. by the end of 2017, which will allow us to be more nimble as we roll out digital initiatives going forward.","Finally, Taco Bell faced increased value pressure from the burger chains in the first quarter, and posted 1% same-store sales growth. Same-store sales improved throughout the quarter, and we remain confident in achieving 3% same-store sales growth for the year, with a stronger second half than first half. Despite the lower than expected full quarter sales, operating margin improved 150 basis points to 28%, and operating profit grew 4%. Restaurant margins also improved 150 basis points at 21%, and we expect full-year margins to be greater than 20% this year, albeit slightly lower than last year.","On the development front, we opened 49 new restaurants in the first quarter, with 90% opened by franchisees and licensees. Of our new openings, seven were international units. We expect to open a record number of Taco Bell units internationally in 2016 as we continue to make progress in building out the unit level economics as we enter the new countries.","I'd now like to shift to our 2016 outlook with our strong first quarter results and a change in China's tax laws whereby a value-added tax, or VAT, is replacing the business tax, we are raising our full year core operating profit growth forecast to 12% from 10% for Yum! For a little bit of background on the VAT, China recently announced further reform to its retail tax structure, which is intended to be a progressive and positive shift to more closely align with the more modern service-based economy. Under this reform, a 6% output VAT would replace the 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT would be credible to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. This change is effective May 1, 2016, so it in no way had any impact on our first quarter performance. While it's difficult to estimate the impact of this VAT reform prior to its actual implementation, Yum! China currently expects a positive financial benefit, further enabling continued investment in the business, and creating thousands of additional jobs in China.","While we are raising our forecast for core operating profit growth from Yum! from 10% to 12%, we are maintaining our guidance for China same-store sales of 2% to 3% for the full year. From a modeling standpoint, there are two other things to bear in mind as you build your forecast.","First, the second quarter in China, which is typically our seasonally low quarter, happens to be our toughest hurdle of the year on a two-year, three-year, and four-year stacked same-store sales basis. Second, we have an RGM convention in the second quarter that we did not have last year that we expect to cost around $7 million. It is important for you to note that these factors were fully factored into our initial guidance and our first half and full year performance is expected to exceed our expectations coming into the year.","All in for Yum!, we outperformed our expectations in the first quarter, and are raising our full year guidance to 12% core operating profit growth, including the 53rd week. This takes into account the strong first quarter produced by KFC China, weakness at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, and the expected VAT benefit in China, in addition to our brand divisions continuing to produce results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. It is early in the year to raise guidance, but we feel confident given where things stand and we'll update you as the year progresses.","Now, I'd like to quickly update you on our spin-off plans. We remain on track to complete the spin-off by year end. We plan on filing our initial Form-10 by early May, and conducting comprehensive road shows ahead of the separation. This spin-off will establish two unique investment opportunities, and create one of the largest U.S.-listed China retail businesses. Another key aspect of our strategy is to optimize the capital structure of Yum!. Given the significant improvement we've seen recently in the debt markets, we'd like to announce another milestone in our previously communicated plan of targeting company-wide leverage of approximately 5 times EBITDA. In early May, we plan to enter into a new financing facility of at least $2 million, securitizing Taco Bell U.S. royalties. As the next step in our plan, subsidiaries that operate our KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell's businesses, excluding the Taco Bell subsidiaries included in the securitization financing are expected to enter into a new senior secured credit facility and issue new high-yield notes. More details will be forthcoming in a separate release later today. In line with what we've previously communicated, we plan to complete our rate (19:26) capitalization and have approximately $9 billion in debt outstanding by the end of the second quarter.","Finally, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have bought back 24.7 million shares at an average price of $71, returning a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders, excluding dividends. As previously announced, our recap will enable us to complete an additional $4.4 billion return of capital return to shareholders.","So let me wrap things up. I'm pleased we started 2016 off with a strong quarter. We're confident we'll deliver 12% core operating profit growth for the full year, and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business into an independent publicly-traded company. We're working diligently to set up both companies for future success and look forward to updating you on any progress throughout the year.","And with that, I'll hand the call back to Greg.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Dave. Before we start Q&A, I wanted to provide a brief update on our plans for the China business. You may have seen recent news stories about a sale or a potential strategic investor. I want to assure you that we are fully committed to maximizing the value of our China business for the benefit of our shareholders, and we will carefully consider all options to achieve that goal. As you know, we announced in October that after careful consideration, we believe that the best way to maximize shareholder value is to spin off our China business by the end of this year, and we are making great progress towards the spin-off. We won't have any further comment on this.","And with that, I'll open the call up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. Gentlemen, your first question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David, your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Fundamental question about China for Micky, if I may. Regarding Pizza Hut, what have you done so far, perhaps even through the second quarter to date, with regard to the menu and the marketing? I know you wanted to get back to that five-star dining at three-star prices. Have you done stuff so far? How is that working? And how has your thinking generally evolved about the timetable for a turnaround for the Pizza Hut brand? Thanks.","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Thank you, David. I hope you can hear me, because I had a bit of trouble. I'll speak slowly. First, on Pizza Hut, I just wanted to say to all of you that it is an extremely strong brand in China. All our consumer metrics, the brand image tracking that we do regularly shows that brand regard value scores, food scores are very high and they recovered fully from the crisis that we had a couple of years ago. We opened 280 new Pizza Huts last year, and new unit returns are very good. Over the last four years, we have opened 1,000 Pizza Huts dine-in restaurants alone and we dwarf the competition.","So it is a very strong brand. It is true that same-store sales have been negative, but in 2015, for example, our system sales were up 10 points, and we do track through CREST in 22 cities, and also through publicly reported companies that operate in casual dining here the overall casual dining performance. And it is our understanding that we gained market share. Part of the reason the casual dining sector has been hit has been due to a decline in consumer confidence. And as we explained in December last year, part of it was on account of the fact that home delivery through aggregators was growing. This latter phenomenon has tapered off a bit on account of burnouts, et cetera.","So we fully expect that Pizza Hut will turn the corner. It is a strong brand. Margin performance has been good. Our sales were minus 1% system sales in the first quarter, but our goal is to get to same-store sales positive. I cannot put a date on it, David, because the market is volatile, but we are doing a number of things. First is that we have shifted the focus back to the core menu with a lot of pizza activity. So we will have more pizza innovation in the next six months than we've had in a long time, and these have tested very well.","The second, I believe, is our value scores are actually good. You can eat lunch at a Pizza Hut at just a little more than at a KFC. So there's no need for any margin compression, but we do need to communicate that value better, which we have started doing. We have clarified the brand position significantly, and we've hired one of the best celebrities in China to bring that point home.","And lastly, we continue to emphasize customer service for the programs that will be presented in December. So with that, I feel much better about Pizza Hut than I did a few months ago, but of course, I'm disappointed that same-store sales are still negative. And I might also remind you, as you know very well, that Pizza Hut is about 25% of our sales and our profit. So one way to look at it is that three of the four engines that drive the Yum! China business are KFC. And with KFC performing well, I think we have the ability to sort Pizza Hut in coming quarters.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Micky. Thanks, David. Amy, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John, your line is open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Micky, I'll keep you on the line. On KFC, you talked about the bucket promotion being an essential driver. So how much of the success in the first quarter was related just to that? And I guess related, how if it was very \u2013 if it was a successful promotion, how much of that sustains going forward? If you can talk about sustainability of those sales, maybe since we're well into April here. And can you also just \u2013 commodities were significantly deflationary this quarter. I think they are supposed to be up this year. So are you changing your view on commodities, or was this just the timing of better commodities in the first quarter but not for the year?","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, it's Greg.","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Yeah, John \u2013 go ahead.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll just...no, no, I'm just going to jump in first and then obviously let you provide the detail. Look, first, I want to commend Micky and the entire China team for what I think is a fantastic Q1. KFC China delivered 12% same-store sales growth, and as you can see from the 42% growth in op profit, the earnings power of the business is extraordinary when sales are working in our favor. And we're very encouraged that we have now had three consecutive quarters of same-store sales at KFC China. I think, fortunately, we didn't assume and we don't need heroic numbers like this to continue throughout the year to reach our 2016 guidance of 2% to 3% same-store sales growth. And recent history shows that sales in China have been difficult for us to call.","So regarding our expectations coming into the year, KFC sales were obviously much better in Q1 than we could've imagined. In Q2, we are closer to where we thought we would be for KFC as we believe that our successful Chinese New Year may have pulled forward some of our early Q2 sales into Q1. That said, six weeks into the quarter, KFC sales are slightly positive, and we're encouraged by where the business is going. And obviously, I'll let Micky speak to that in more detail.","And as \u2013 we know that we've still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut in China and quarter-to-date, sales have remained double-digit negative. But again, as Dave mentioned, our Q2 laps at both KFC and Pizza Hut's more difficult, especially when you look at these multi-year stacks. We feel great about the start to the year. We're confidently raising our guidance. We still expect China full year \u2013 China Division same-store sales to be in the 2% to 3% range, which is consistent with our expectations. So with that, I'll just let Micky take over. I just wanted to compliment Micky and the team for a job well done.","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Thank you, Greg. I think, John, there were some factors that were unique to Q1 and that is to do with the Chinese New Year. It was the Year of the Monkey, and we were fortunate that the \u2013 actually, it was not just fortune, but the team of KFC has really hit their stride. So Joey Wat, who is a very accomplished retail executive, has now really understood the rhythm of the KFC business. And they put together sort of a one, two, three punch around the Chinese New Year, extending it from the traditional 10 days to about four weeks, centered around a very powerful bucket promotion. But also then with activity afterwards featuring a grilled sandwich, which was good thinking, because after a heavy Chinese New Year, people are looking for a healthier fare. So that aspect is unique to the Chinese New Year, and I think it was a spectacularly successful promotion.","Somebody asked me how we will ever lap that next year, and I think the one bit of good news we have is next year is actually the Year of the Chicken, so we started work already on the sort of promotion that we will be running. But some of the factors that worked in Q1 actually give me encouragement for KFC overall. The first is the success of selling our core products: fried chicken, hot wings, french fries, egg tarts, and all the familiar favorites in China. And we are extending that principle by doing more activity around buckets in the back half of the year, and also introducing Box Meals, which are a proven international success where you can buy fairly good \u2013 just like a little bit more money, but significantly more product.","As you can imagine, following a very large success in January and February, we hit almost record volumes in the amount of chicken that we did sell, and also that sale was accompanied by corresponding traffic growth. The ticket impact on our sales of plus 12% in Q1 was about 3%. So it wasn't as though the \u2013 sorry, the pricing impact. It wasn't as though we took pricing to get there. The price impact was only plus 3%. The rest of it was on account of the fact that party sizes for these large buckets were very large, and also there was a significant increase in the number of items bought per person, because the promotion was very well run.","In Q2, we're about halfway through the quarter. The pleasing thing is that KFC is positive. But as Greg said, there's a lot of volatility around it. It's a difficult quarter because we've got tough laps. We've had some expenses. Our goal as a team here is to make Q2 this year the fourth consecutive quarter of positive KFC same-store sales. But I cannot say that that's a guarantee until we have more visibility. But the fact that the flow-through was very strong in profit terms, the simplification of the menu boards, which was well conducted, the strength of the marketing calendar in the back half gives me and the team a lot more confidence that we had six months ago.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Micky.","David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller","First, to further what Micky said a little bit, too \u2013 the timing of Chinese New Year, with it being a little bit earlier this year, did provide a slight benefit to Q1 which will be a little bit \u2013 hurts Q2 a little bit. So that was a little bit on the sales line. As far as your commodities question, John, we saw a 2% decline in commodities in China during the first quarter. And we are still on our forecast for plus 1% for the full year.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, John. Amy, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Joseph, your line is open.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you. You gave a little bit of this in answer to the last question, but could you talk about traffic versus price versus mix for both KFC China and KFC Pizza Hut during the quarter?","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Yeah, Joe, it's Steve. For the division, we had about \u2013 for the 6% comp for the division, we had nine points of check growth and a three-point decline in transactions overall.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Presumably, though, positive transactions at KFC?","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","That's the number for the division.","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Yes, we had positive transactions at KFC. And as I said that the transaction number as we measured it is the number of tickets we cut in the store. But as I explained, the size of the ticket was bigger on account of shareable meals, principally the bucket. So we estimate that the price impact on our sales was about 3%, and the rest of it was on account of traffic plus a larger check on account of more items being bought. So it was a fairly healthy growth.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And then just switching topics for a moment, Pizza Hut U.S. numbers look pretty good. Pizza Hut international slightly negative. Can you talk a little bit about Pizza Hut international, and what's going on there, and what changes you can implement there?","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, certainly, Joe. I think the good news, as you said, is Pizza Hut U.S. had an excellent quarter, same-store sales up 5%, company transactions were up 8%. I think a combination of the $6.99 Pairs and the $5 Flavor Menu have certainly worked. And obviously, what we're doing now is in the process of taking that success and all the tactics that are associated with that and expanding that rapidly on a global basis. So like all things, this business is very much driven by our U.S. success, and I think what we're doing now is in the process of rolling out that U.S. success and taking it around on a global basis.","I happened to be in Thailand, actually in January, earlier in the year and you can see already that that team was starting to take the successful tactics that were working and start to see how we can implement those in that country. And that's happening around the world.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Joe. Next question, please, Amy.","Operator","Yes. Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Two unrelated questions, if I may. First one for you, Micky. For a number of years now, labor costs, labor dollars per operating week in China have been a pretty major contributor to margins. As you do plan to re-grow customer traffic, obviously, in the segment and want to stay competitive with wages, are we at the point now where labor starts to inflect the other way, and adding back costs into the system that have been taken out over the last several years?","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Well, it's true that over the last five years labor has inflated in China on account of minimum wage increases by the government. But we've seen a moderation of that. I think the authorities recognize that the economy has to be supported, so I think we're seeing a more reasonable picture there. What we did get in the quarter particularly was some good productivity gains on account of using more part-time and student labor, which is a phenomenon that did not exist in China in the long past, and that is making a difference. So looking forward, it's always a risk, but I don't see labor price inflation as being a significant risk. I think the key for us is going to be product innovation, sensible pricing, and get traffic scores back. So I hope that helps.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you. And then secondly, I thought the commentary on the capital structure was interesting in that part of the new capital structure is going to be a royalty securitization only to Taco Bell, which I don't think your previous debt actually assigned itself to individual brands. So I just wanted to understand the symbolism behind the debt security that's only related to Taco Bell. And could people's imagination start to think that Taco Bell doesn't necessarily remain a part of Yum! over the long-term if an opportunity arises?","W. Lawrence Gathof - Treasurer & Vice President","Hi, John, it's Larry Gathof. I'll answer the debt aspect of it anyways. But what we're doing is we're trying to take advantage of the debt markets in total. So we're looking at doing both a securitization, bank and bond debt. So we're putting debt across all the different avenues to again get the best pricing and optimize our balance sheet. The Taco Bell securitization is only going to be on the U.S. Taco Bell franchise and license fees. So it's just that part. The rest of the Taco Bell business will also be part of the other borrowings. So again, the securitization market, quite honestly, isn't deep enough to do any one of our entire businesses. So we just peeled off the piece that we thought was most appropriate for a securitization and are accessing that market. And then again, we'll have the balance of the borrowings across all three brands after that's completed.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, John, to put it bluntly, I wouldn't want anyone to take away any thinking that we're going to be doing anything to Taco Bell, other than love it as a part of the portfolio, love its growth, love its profit contribution, and love that it is a brand that we can take global.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, John. Amy, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with UBS. Keith, your line is open.","Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Greg, just a question for you, having come from the Taco Bell brand and having watched that brand be one of the leaders in terms of overall digital engagement, mobile ordering and more, where do you \u2013 how do you feel about the rest of the U.S. portfolio and positioning now? Are you making the progress you want? Is Pizza Hut becoming more of a leader in its categories? Is KFC also coming along? And then what about tests on delivery for other brands like home meal replacement for KFC and even for Taco Bell. Is the rest of the U.S. portfolio catching up to Taco Bell? Where do we stand? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Keith, good question, and I would say yes. I think the great thing is we can codify what makes Taco Bell successful; and obviously the other two brands can obviously track with what they've done and obviously attempt to replicate it, but in their own brand voice. So I'm very pleased with the progress that Pizza Hut's making. I think its positioning around making it easier to get a better pizza, I think not only the sales growth but the transaction growth that we just got. Obviously, part of making it easier was to get our value better on Pizza Hut, which we've done. But I think you \u2013 as we also said on the call, we are investing in technology. We do need to get from nine POS systems down to one POS system. But as we also said, 46% of our delivery carryout sales are digital and that's growing. So I do think we're making good progress there.","On the KFC side, I think the Always Original positioning, the move back to Finger Lickin' Good, the great thing about KFC in the U.S. is it's the brand that's now being talked about. And I think for a long time it wasn't on anyone's radar screen, so I'm very comfortable. I think the launch of Nashville Hot has really helped. Obviously, there is a value game being played by the burger boys because of beef pricing; but I think the return to $5 boxes has been a good move by the KFC team.","And then for Taco Bell, yes, the answer is I think we're now in 500 stores doing delivery in a couple of the key cities, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas. I'm not quite sure where else, but \u2013 so that's been expanded. And I think if you just take the overall concept of easy beats better, which I know the Pizza Hut team originated, but what it basically says is yes, we've got to find ways to make it easier for our people, for customers to get to our brands. We do that two ways: we build more units, but we also obviously will start looking at delivery as a way to get our food to customers in their home. So very good question. We're making progress. The other brands, I think, are moving to where the Taco Bell brand strength is. A lot of work to be done, but I think we're moving in the right direction. I'm encouraged by that.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Keith. Amy, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David, your line is open.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning. My question is on the guidance for the year. And I was wondering if you could provide some additional detail or insight on what you're assuming for China profit growth for the year in that guidance and maybe also the margin that you expect to deliver in that business for the full year.","David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller","Sure. So, the first thing I'd say is if you're going to have a good quarter at Yum!, you want it to be the first quarter of the year, which is what we certainly did and had a blowout quarter in China. So when we looked at that first quarter, as well as some of the other \u2013 the tailwinds we have in the business with regards to the VAT we talked about earlier, though, it's very difficult to quantify the benefit, we know there's something there, some of the commodity deflation that we're seeing, we felt very confident that even with some of the other headwinds we're facing, particularly Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China, of getting to a number that was up 12% for the year. As we said, we have not yet \u2013 we have not adjusted the same-store sales forecast for the balance of year for China. It's just too difficult to call given we're only three and a half months in. But at this point, we feel very comfortable with the 12%.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean the way I look at it is to raise guidance in the first quarter demonstrates a degree of confidence we've got in the year. As we said, there will be some puts and calls as the year unfolds, no doubt; but we felt confident in raising it from 10% to 12%.","David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller","And you asked specifically about the margins in China. Given they are so dependent upon sales, we're still thinking somewhere along \u2013 we're not coming off our guidance from the beginning of the year around 16% at this point.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And I guess \u2013 if 'm still on, I guess if the margin guidance still is around 16% for the year, I guess I'm a little confused on that, given the over-performance in Q1. Was there something that changed about the outlook for the last three quarters? Or is this some level of conservatism that you're baking in or perhaps...","David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller","No, I don't think so. I don't think we're thinking about it necessarily in that level of detail. I think we're saying it's just too early. We're off to a great start. With the Q1 success that we had, we feel very good with the 12%. But I don't think you should be reading that into the balance of your forecast.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, David. Amy, next question, please.","Operator","Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Two things. Just one, I was hoping to get a little bit more color from Micky on the China side. Obviously, with the short-term strength, which seems to be attributed to the New Year's promotion, just wondering how, in your mind, you perhaps separate that from the longer-term recovery efforts? Just it seems like you're confident that the brand, I think, you said has really turned. But then it seems like maybe in March and in April things have really eased. So I'm just wondering how you think about the business over the next 12 months in terms of just short-term spikes because of promotion versus the long-term trajectory improving. And then I had one follow-up on Taco Bell U.S.","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Yeah, well, thanks, Jeffrey. Like I said, I think the team and myself are feeling very much more confident. We just this week had all of our store managers, so we had a stadium in the city of Dalian with 8,000 people talking about the theme for the future, which is From Strength to Strength. And in particular, when the KFC section was discussed and we put out plans for the rest of the year and the positioning and the proposed marketing, there was just an unbounded confidence. So I feel that \u2013 I really feel the brand is making a lot of progress. It is much stronger. I think the positioning is very clear. The calendars are strong. We are doing sensible things around the core of the brand. We've already cleaned up the menu boards. We will do that even more. We're introducing proven international winners. I think you always have to be cautious when you come to China, because there is economic volatility, and there is also unexpected twists and turns. So there is nothing hidden; it is not as though we are worried about some specific event or there is something happening that causes us to worry. But you just want to be cautious. We've had two years or three years of a lot of volatility.","So the way we are looking at it right now is it's a show me, don't tell me sort of story. And we're hoping quarter after quarter to improve and strengthen the business. I think it's been mentioned a number of times Q2 is going to be a difficult quarter on account of a variety of factors. But we are very focused on seeing whether we can deliver positive same-store sales and take it from there.","So, on KFC I feel confident. I feel that the brand is making a lot of progress. The other thing we didn't talk about today is that we've spent a lot of energy and are going to be taking very good care of store refurbishment. We have good designs, we've got good plans for aggressive refurbs of some of our older stores. We are opening a symbolically important 5,000th store in Shanghai, which is, I think, maybe the best KFC in the world. It's a state-of-the-art green store which will open next week. So I think the brand is making progress on every front.","On Pizza Hut, like I said before, I am very disappointed at negative same-store sales. And I don't see any reason why we cannot turn it around. There is no intrinsic reason. All our scores are good; our competitive position is fantastic. There really is no international competitor with the name. And in addition to the 1,500 dine-in stores we've got about 300 delivery units which dwarf the competition. So I feel the brands are really genuinely making progress. It's just that it's been two months \u2013 the first quarter was two months. And to make a call on the rest of the year knowing what we've seen over the last three years seems to be out of the bounds of what we should be doing. So that hopefully gives you some context on the way we're looking at it.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","For sure. And then just, Greg, I just wanted to follow up.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","You made a comment about the Taco Bell U.S. It seems like maybe it was a little light of your internal expectation, which I think you attributed to maybe some of the QSR burger competitors taking advantage of favorable beef. So I'm just wondering, just to get a better understanding of your response, does it seem like getting more aggressive presumably on value? I know you've obviously been with the brand for a long time and gone through these phases before. But just the idea that you'd progressively pursue the discounting versus staying the course with your initial plan, just trying to get your thoughts.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Jeffrey. I think the first thing I want to do is just correct it. Apparently in my prepared remarks I think I said the breakfast mix was 8%; it's actually 6%. The 8% is actually the transaction growth that we got in breakfast in Q1, so I just want to clarify that. By the way, I'm very happy with 8% transaction growth in breakfast with one of our competitors doing All Day Breakfast. So let me just say that.","So to answer your question, yes, we had tied the launch of the Quesalupa to the Super Bowl. I tried to get the Super Bowl brought forward a couple of weeks because that would have really helped us, but unfortunately the NFL wasn't going to play along. So we were so tied up to the launch with that event that there was a couple of weeks where we were a little naked, I would say. And so obviously, sales and transactions up to there were soft. The good news is that after that event, the Quesalupa has mixed at over 10% and has done well for us.","But I think even more importantly Brian, who is doing a great job leading the brand, he and the team have already changed the calendar and in fact, today, we will launch some new $1 items into the marketplace. There have been a number of revisions to the calendar. So I think we can still be an incredibly innovative brand, a socially conscious brand, led by digital. But we can also just get our value so it's more than competitive in the marketplace. I think talking to Brian the other day, he and I still have a lot of confidence we'll deliver the at least 3% same-store sales growth for the year at Taco Bell.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Jeff. Amy, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk Management. Howard, your line is open.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could help me with the Chinese culture and what the zodiac calendar and chicken means next year in terms of what that asset potentially could do for business. Thanks.","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Yeah. I don't think it is a very serious factor, frankly. The Year of the Dragon and the Monkey are particular significance. Every year is important. One interesting feature that Joey and the team put together was they actually introduced a Christmas Bucket in 2015 December which was reasonably successful, so they are dialing that up. So I think the point really is that if you do a good bucket-oriented calendar in December for Christmas and then Chinese New Year next year, we can look to a good performance.","The success of the Monkey \u2013 the Year of the Monkey promotion has shown to us the importance of choosing the character well, the toys that go with it, the kids meals that accompany it, which will all help us to build for the future. And I think the Year of the Chicken does help. There is no better authority on chicken than KFC. But I don't think it's going to be culturally that significant that people have to eat chicken in the Year of the Chicken or something like that. So it's a help. And all I was saying was that to lap this very successful Year of the Monkey promotion, that's one little gift on our side.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","Okay, and if I could ask...","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Go for it.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","Sorry. Thank you. So, Greg, nine months ago, obviously, the quarter wasn't as strong as you would have hoped. And then we go through the process of you spinning out the China business and talking about the change of the structure of the company and now nine months forward things look a lot better. I was wondering if you could maybe put tangible evidence around an intangible question. And that is, what the changes internally to the employees of Yum! and Yum! China have done to help turn the business around? I don't know if I'm asking that correctly, but I think part of the reason for doing this spin was maybe to focus on the different assets. And this obviously was a fantastic quarter and for all those reasons \u2013 maybe some of those reasons \u2013 I'm struggling to ask the question properly.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's all right.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","But just wondering if some of them \u2013 thank you. Sorry. Go ahead.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Howard, I'll have a go. I think I couldn't be happier to have Micky leading the team. Micky has an enormous amount of just experience, has the confidence of all of us, and did an amazing job running our international business for such a long period of time on all three brands. So I've got a leader in there who I have the utmost confidence in and who has rallied the team in China. We've got great people leading the brands, Joey and Peter. They are just \u2013 they're really \u2013 I think I was there in March looking at the plans, looking at what they've learned from the lessons. Our culture is alive and well in China. So the whole recognition culture and our belief that culture fuels results, I think, was absolutely evident.","And I think at the same time, what's also happening in the whole business is that we're getting much better at brand building and strengthening our brand positioning. And so I think China \u2013 I would say the words aren't exactly always original; I thinks it's: be your true self. But they pretty much resonate. We've now got this brand on a global positioning so we can leverage things. Micky has reached out and taken things like the $5 boxes that have been incredibly successful in a number of markets. As he said, they will go into the market soon in China. The Pizza Hut team is looking at a new positioning for Pizza Hut. And as Micky said, I think focusing on the pizza and less on the more and getting back to the core will help that brand as well. So I would sum it up as new leader, great leader, fresh perspective, great team, more global alignment, and a real focus on brand building, all underpinned by our fundamental belief that we leverage culture to fuel results.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","Thanks.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Howard, thanks. Next question, please, Amy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Brian, your line is open.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Thanks a lot. I just want to ask a question on Taco Bell. You did roll out your pretty aggressive $1 breakfast menu in March you said; so it didn't really impact the full first quarter. Can you just talk about how this is impacting the overall business? Is it accretive to your sales trends? Is it doing what you expected it to do? And externally, us looking at the margin, how should we think about how this impacts the food margin going forward or the COGS margin?","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the good news, as I said, we had 8% transaction growth in the breakfast daypart in the first quarter before we really got a full impact of the $1 menu. So, I think we feel really good that that's going to continue to have an impact on our breakfast business. Our food and paper costs for breakfast are in line for the balance of the business. So whether it grows or grows faster or slower doesn't really impact the overall food and paper costs. The good news is, obviously, Taco Bell is benefiting from the price of beef right now, and that's obviously why you're seeing in the marketplace a lot of value by both the burger chains and why Taco Bell can play an aggressive play in beef as well.","David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller","I would just add, Brian, that at 6% mix, the breakfast doesn't change the overall Taco Bell story much.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, yeah. I think the good news is it's growing. It's growing in the face of us being focused. We're doing the right thing, which we have got innovative products, we've got value now in that category, in that daypart. And I feel really good. I was out in restaurants in the U.S. just recently, visited Taco Bells for breakfast, got great food, and had a great experience. And I think the general feeling is that this is something we're going to invest in for the long-term.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Brian. Amy, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Andy, your line is open.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Yes, just a quick follow-up on that and then one other quick one. On the Taco Bell margin maintenance in terms of your guidance for the year, even with a more sharpened value focus, is lower commodity cost really the primary reason you feel confident in that still?","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think two things. I do believe we'll deliver at least 3% same-store sales growth for the full year. So obviously, we got off to a slower than expected start. But as we said, we are rolling out the big numbers, plus 6%. But in the discussions I've had with Brian, he still feels very confident. So I think we're confident we will deliver the same-store sales growth that we're (54:15) in the U.S. and obviously commodities are favorable, and I think all signs are that certainly beef will stay favorable probably through the balance of 2016.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","And then just quickly on emerging markets at KFC, I know you called out a couple of Pizza Hut markets. That number was only up 1%. Is there any specific country or area that was a little softer this quarter?","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, I think that when you're in 120 \u2013 130 countries, I always \u2013 I'm never quite sure how many countries we're in on any one day, I think the good news is we had \u2013 in 130 countries, you're going to have some up markets and some downs. India was minus 1% but Russia was plus 27% in system sales for KFC. We also had strong developed markets. Australia delivered another really good quarter. They were plus 5%, which \u2013 if you think about what they've been rolling over. So we were soft in a number of places, but there is also real signs of real strength both in emerging and developed. And I think that Roger Eaton and the team believe that they also can obviously get sales up into at least the 3% same-store sales growth number for the year.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Andy. Next question, please, Amy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is open.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So, a question on China that's actually not on comp sales but on new store productivity. It looks like there is still a growing gap between comp growth and average weekly sales growth. And just curious if you could comment on that. Is it being driven by one of the two brands, units in one area or another? And any sort of update on how to be thinking about unit economics per year because I think the last disclosures we have really only go through like 2014. Thanks.","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Okay. Karen, what were you quoting as the reason why you had that feeling?","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That if you look at overall store productivity growth, so just sales per unit versus comp growth, it looks like the gap between those two numbers is still getting wider.","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","I see. Well, when we look at our performance by peers, it's pretty consistent. So I don't think there's a particular factor there. And I really can't at the moment think of a particular reason. That certainly has not struck me that the new units that we are building are in any way have inferior economics or any such. It's not as though we're building necessarily smaller units. It is true that we built more stores in smaller cities, but our comp sales growth across peers has been fairly consistent. We are experimenting with multiple store formats to take into account the fact that there is still a very rapid build-out in infrastructure in China. So we're expecting \u2013 very large number of malls are already under construction; the high-speed rail network is being expanded. And then in China, unlike the U.S., there is not the phenomenon at the moment of highways with drive-throughs or the rest stops, and all those are being developed.","I don't really see the character of our productivity per unit changing in the years to come. I think worldwide there is a trend to what we call small box, which is because in-lines are becoming more popular in mall stores, et cetera. So there may be in the longer term a slightly smaller format unit. But China is not that impacted, because we hardly have any drive-throughs here. You hardly have any drive-throughs at all, so most of them are in-lines anyway. So maybe we need to think about this question a little more. But we don't intrinsically see any reason why the sort of growth we've enjoyed should not be projected long-term into the future.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Karen. Next question, please, Amy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is open.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks, guys. Two questions. One, if \u2013 Micky, I'd love to have your thoughts now that you've been over in China for a while on the idea of franchising certain brands or markets or stores in China. Just your outlook and thoughts there.","And then secondly, Dave, could you walk through again the math or the reasoning behind the VAT change and how that impacts the business and why you think it would be positive? It would be helpful just to understand that a little bit better. Thanks.","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Okay. So, the VAT question I will leave to Dave. I don't know, Dave, whether you want to take that first or...","David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller","No, go ahead, Micky. I'll go second. Go ahead, Micky.","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Okay. And just remind me, sorry, your first question was?","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just your outlook for franchising in China. Would you like to convert more company stores to franchise, yeah?","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Yeah, right. Sorry. Right, yes. Right. Well, at the moment, as you know, we have stayed at about just over 7,000 stores. About 10% are franchised and 90% are equity. I think at the moment as long as we have \u2013 and the way we never chase a number of stores that we have to build. But when we get new trade zones opening and opportunities that make commercial sense, and there's a very disciplined process for capital allocation and measuring new unit returns, we have a lot of surplus capital, as you know, in China. All the stores here have been built with Chinese-generated capital. There is no intrinsic reason why we would want to give that up to franchisees.","The two reasons why we do expect, however, franchising to up marginally is, firstly, there are regions of the country where it makes sense for franchisees to operate. We recently opened in the autonomous region of Tibet, our first store in Lhasa, Tibet. And for a variety of reasons, including difficult operating conditions and local market knowledge, that was given to a franchisee. And that's been successful and I think that will grow. So there are parts of the country where we will do it for reasons that it makes sense to do it that way. And the other is that there will be opportunities to do franchising, for example, with gas station chains, et cetera. And for those technical reasons the percentage of franchising might go up from 10% to maybe 15% or something in the foreseeable future, but we don't expect a significant change in there.","And of course, if we do not find the ability to invest our capital in productive equity investment, sure, we'll look at franchising more actively. We are not \u2013 at the moment, we are agnostic to whether it's franchising or equity, frankly. But both have advantages. Franchisees can \u2013 obviously, they're capital light and also they're very innovative. But at the moment, with the capital that we have, especially as we become independent, I think it will be a good use of the capital to continue to invest. China is a growth market the way we see it, and we still have the vision of doubling or trebling our store base. So that's the way we're looking at it. So I would say the franchising percentage will edge up, but it will not be a game changer in our business.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Micky. Dave?","David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller","Okay. So, on the VAT, so currently, China is paying 5% of all their sales in the form of a business tax to the government. What's happening now is China is moving to a more traditional VAT regime, which is similar to the regime in many other parts of the world, where we will pay 6% of those top-line sales to the government; but we'll get a credit for some of the inputs that we have into our P&L, commodities, utilities, rent, against that 6% credit. What's difficult for us to say right now is exactly how that those credits are going to accumulate and what exactly is going to be creditable. And we are working through that. As you can imagine, with 6,000 stores this is going to be a monumental effort. And there is also some lack of clarity around the rules at this point, still. So we're going to have a lot more for you in July. We'll have one month worth of this in our Q2 results \u2013 the benefit in our Q2 results and we'll be able to quantify it in much more detail at that point in time.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Jason. Next question, please, Amy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Andrew, your line is open.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Micky, as you saw success with an operationally simple promotion at KFC in the first quarter, I realize Pizza Hut is not as time-sensitive of an occasion, but there are opportunities to implement better operational practices of that brand particularly around the breadth of the menu?","Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China","Yeah, absolutely, Andrew, there are. I think the menu is complicated. I think I had mentioned this in December as well. It's a tabbed menu. You actually have \u2013 it's a very large number of pages. It's a book. It's a little difficult to navigate, so simplifying that is a priority. Pizza Hut is celebrated and known for the variety of menu here, so we do not want to lose that. But at the same time, I think we can make it far more controlled. It also speeds up service. And table turns are an issue at Pizza Hut at peak times. So for those reasons, we are rationalizing the menu. We are also, like I said earlier, pointing out the great value that we have through lunch combos and other offers. So we are redesigning that part of the menu as well.","And lastly, I'm constantly amazed at how advanced China is digitally. It's got twice the number of cell phones, smartphones, as the U.S. population. And even in our offices, people go up and down the elevator to go to lunch, they're looking up where the offers are available and where they can book a table, et cetera. So the action is shifting very rapidly to mobile devices, and both the menu as well as digital marketing is becoming very significant. So we're working on that. The good news is that for both our brands we are in a leadership position when it comes to that whole digital interface, cashless payment, et cetera. But to your question, yes, I think the operational simplicity at KFC, making it easier for consumers to choose our best-selling products and the general philosophy that the menu should not be a \u2013 it should be used more as guiding customers to our best-selling products than to give open choices, which they get confused about is something that is applicable at Pizza Hut as well.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Micky. Thanks, Andrew. Amy, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Gentlemen, your last question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank. Brett, your line is open.","Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning and thank you. Can you guys provide us with a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about the re-franchising efforts in terms of cadence across the divisions? How we should be thinking about it over the next six months to three years out. Thank you.","David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller","Sure. So, the plan is still to be 96% franchised by the end of 2017, which that will include the China units, post-spin. This year, more of what's going to get done are the U.S. re-franchising, which is going to be KFCs and -- I'm sorry, Taco Bells and to a lesser degree Pizza Hut. We would expect significant gains in those regards. Quite frankly, selling some of the international markets is a little bit more difficult, so that will take a little bit more time. We expect that to be more 2017 loaded.","Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Brett.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Brett.","Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So, I just want to thank everyone for being on the call. Obviously, we're pleased we're off to a strong start in 2016, that we've raised full-year core operating profit guidance to 12% from 10%.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you, Steve Schmitt, VP of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy, may begin your conference.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Joana. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Novak, Chairman and CEO; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. Following remarks from David and Pat, we will take your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.","In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands\u2019 Web site www.yum.com to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today\u2019s call.","We are broadcasting this call via our Web site. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.","As a reminder, at the beginning of this year we combined our Yum! Restaurant International and U.S. divisions into three global brand divisions; KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. China and India remained separate divisions giving their strategic importance and enormous growth potential. This new structure is designed to drive greater global brand focus enabling more effective knowhow sharing and accelerating growth.","Beginning this quarter our financial reporting will reflect our new structure with comparable prior periods adjusted accordingly.","Finally, we would like to remind you of the following upcoming Yum! investor events. Our Taco Bell Investor Day will be in Irvine, California on May 15th. And our second quarter earnings will be released on Wednesday, July 16th.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Novak.","David Novak","Alright, thank you Steve and good morning everyone. I am pleased to report Yum! Brands is off to a strong start. Based on first quarter results and current sales trends we expect to deliver on the strong bounce back year we promised of at least 20% full year of EPS growth excluding special items.","We had particularly strong results in China, emerging markets continue to have positive momentum and developed markets like KFC in the UK and Australia, were strong. However, like most retailers our U.S. business was soft driven impart by cold weather.","Now as we see in the release, we\u2019re obviously pleased to report our China division continues to steadily improve, with both KFC and Pizza Hut producing strong sales and margin growth, driving our first quarter EPS growth of 24% prior to special items. In total our China division delivered system sales growth of 17% in the quarter as we opened 123 new units and grew same-store sales by 9%.","The China team deserves special tribute as operating profit grew an impressive 80% prior to foreign currency translation. As predicted, productivity gains that began in 2013 now coupled with rebounding sales are driving dramatic profit growth. Clearly the most significant driver of the strong bounce back year for Yum! is a continued sales recovery at our KFC business in China, which delivered same-store sales growth of 11% in the quarter.","Remember this compares to a 4% same-store sales decline during the fourth quarter. Our China division also achieved 23.4% restaurant margins in the first quarter. This compares to a full year restaurant margin of 15.4% in 2013. Obviously seasonality plays a role but to put things into perspective, first quarter restaurant margin for our China division was essentially in line with what we delivered in the first quarter of 2012. Any way you look at it we\u2019re pleased with our progress in China.","Now if you recall we said last quarter that our focus at KFC China in 2014 was to bring more innovation and exciting news to our customers and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. According to our research, we have regained consumer trust and are now beginning our journey to restage KFC at even more useful contemporary and energetic brand that is innovating for a changing China. This is built on three pillars, taste, customer experience and digital. We\u2019re investing behind each of these for us, so the consumer wins.","On March 26th, we announced the debut of an exciting new menu at KFC in our more than 4,600 restaurants in over 950 cities across China. This initiative is unprecedented in KFC\u2019s 27 year history in China and in fact in the entire QSR industry as we introduced 15 products simultaneously. These products are either new or the return of popular items previously offered on a limited time-only basis. The breadth and variety of these products are expected to further strengthen KFC\u2019s leadership in four signature product platforms, sandwiches, rice dishes, snacks as well as drinks and desserts.","Going forward, we plan to do a similar menu update at least once a year. Now if you recall, we revamped 20% of the Pizza Hut Casual Dining menu twice a year, so we\u2019re still in a page out of the successful Pizza Hut playbook.","On the advertising front, we\u2019re having a lot of fun using four useful and popular celebrities who are representing each of the product platforms. It\u2019s early days but we\u2019re pleased with this initiative and expect it to drive high levels of ongoing consumer engagement. Our advertising has already received over 7 million likes in the past three weeks, so clearly we\u2019re having some fun, our customers are enjoying.","Simultaneously, we\u2019re launching redesigned packaging, contemporary staff uniforms, new menu boards and branded service. On the technology front, we\u2019ve begun rolling out Wi-Fi and a number of other new digital initiatives. In fact we will have free Wi-Fi in over 2,000 restaurants by year-end, making us what we believe to be the number one retailer on that front. This is another example of how we\u2019re providing customers a more contemporary environment in which to spend their time.","We also have a new mobile app coming which will provide consumers the convenience of pre-ordering with electronic payment. The goal is to consistently bring exciting and dramatic news to the KFC brand across the year and keep it going. So, let me sum things up for KFC China, we\u2019re early in the year but we\u2019re extremely pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with sales and margins and we expect to build-off our upward momentum balance of year.","Now, as I\u2019ve mentioned before Pizza Hut Casual Dining is arguably one of the greatest success stories in our industry the past three years. We\u2019re clearly the number one western casual dining chain in China with hardly any multi-national competition. We have 1,100 restaurants in over 290 cities and we opened 43 new stores in the first quarter further strengthening our category leading position. We\u2019re once again pleased with our same-store sales growth which was 8% in the first quarter.","Our Pizza Hut more positioning backed by our strategy to refresh 20% of the menu every six months, as well as offer compelling values, is clearly resonating with consumers and driving results. We\u2019re also continuing to leverage our assets throughout the day by expanding our breakfast offering into more and more cities. Importantly, we have an amazingly strong economic model that generates two year cash paybacks on new unit openings. With the terrific performance we\u2019re seeing, we continue to broaden our new unit development of Pizza Hut Casual Dining and are aggressively expanding into lower tier cities. Without question, Pizza Hut Casual Dining is a growing powerhouse with a great future.","The other exciting thing about Pizza Hut is we have a distinct home service brand in China where we deliver an all meal replacement to -- home meal replacement to Chinese consumers. And in fact around 40% of what we deliver is Chinese food. So not only are we delivering pizza but we\u2019re delivering a full array of Chinese menu options. We now have over 200 units in 25 cities and we\u2019re beginning to really scale this brand rapidly across the country. Importantly it\u2019s a high return small box format and sales are almost totally incremental versus our casual dining concept. So, this brand is a separate brand with great potential.","Remember Domino\u2019s and Pizza Hut home delivery both have about 5,000 delivery focused units in United States today. With only around 200 units today in China, this brand is clearly poised for rapid growth in the years ahead. In 2014, we will be testing our Chinese concept East Dawning in lower tier cities and we\u2019re working hard to turnaround Little Sheep which has clearly been a disappointment since we acquired it in 2012 and continues to be so.","Now looking at the long-term, China obviously has a large and growing consuming class which is expect to double from 300 million people to 600 million people by 2020. We\u2019re clearly in the right place at the right time with great brands that are absolutely loved by Chinese customers and we like how we\u2019re positioned and what is still the world\u2019s fastest growing economy which while slowing is still expected to grow more than 75 this year. So in 2014, our new unit development target of at least 700 new stores remains unchanged as we further capitalize on our leading positions in what remains the number one retail opportunity in the world.","Moving to India, where we\u2019re investing in the future in developing a great business which will drive substantial growth for YUM! in the years ahead. At KFC, we continue to innovate around local customer preferences and we\u2019re excited about our second quarter launch of our new vegetarian line of products. We\u2019re focused on strengthening our economic model as we expand in the lower tier cities. Our pizza delivery business is now outperforming our largest delivery competitor from a same-store sale standpoint. And in Taco Bell, we\u2019re making progress developing a scalable economic model with the introduction of a small box format. And while it\u2019s still early days, we\u2019re confident Taco Bell will eventually be a successful business in India.","Overall, we have over 700 restaurants in our India division and we\u2019re full steam ahead with development as we expect to open 150 new units this year. This is on top of over 150 new units in 2013 and while country macros haven\u2019t been as strong as we\u2019d like we made the strategic decision to invest in building each of our brands in the country with well over a billion people.","Now as you know, we recently combined our Yum! Restaurants International and U.S. divisions in the three global brand divisions, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, our intent is to have dedicated brand teams going to work every day focused only on KFC, Pizza Hut or Taco Bell to drive each even more aggrieve global growth. In fact we just concluded our strategic business reviews and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how the organization is coming together. We\u2019ve also never seen such singular brand focus or higher levels of knowhow sharing between the international and U.S. brand teams which is a big competitive advantage. An early benefit of our new brand structure is we expect to set a new development record with over 1,100 new international units outside of China and India this year.","Now let me share our perspective on our new brand division results. Let\u2019s start with KFC. In the first quarter, our KFC division which generates over 90% of its profit outside of the U.S. delivered a solid first quarter in a setup for a successful year. As you may know, we have nearly 14,000 restaurants in over 110 countries around the world, 99% of these KFC\u2019s are franchised. Importantly, we have a strong track-record in emerging markets and we continue to grow our presence with each passing year. In fact 46% of KFC division sales outside of the U.S. in 2013 were generated in emerging markets compared to 40% in 2008. During this timeframe, we increased our store sales base nearly 60%.","Looking ahead, our new unit opportunities in emerging markets is arguably the best in retail with about two KFC restaurants per million people in emerging markets we know we have a long runway for future growth.","Moving to our developed markets, we have very solid businesses in Australia and the UK which both delivered strong results in the first quarter. We\u2019re really focused on spreading knowhow and best practices from these two businesses to our underperforming markets in the United States and Canada.","Now let\u2019s talk about Pizza Hut which clearly had a disappointing quarter. On the positive side, our emerging markets business delivered solid same-store -- system sales growth of 8% in the quarter. Having said this, results were negatively impacted by very poor performance in our U.S. business which contributes about half of Pizza Hut division\u2019s total profits. Same-store sales in the United States declined 5% in the quarter. We launched a new and improved hand-tossed pizza but the news wasn\u2019t strong enough to overcome value focused competitor activity.","Looking ahead, we expect that they are much better with competitive value, our national advertising of WingStreet and with product news like our new garlic parmesan pizza offering. We also intend to do a better job engaging the digital consumer where our competitors are frankly doing a better job driving activation. In fact we\u2019ve committed significant additional resources to our digital agenda and I can assure you that we\u2019re moving forward with a high sense of urgency.","Outside the United States, we\u2019re accelerating new unit development especially across the delivery and express channels. This is a great example of why we decided to reorganize the business as Pizza Hut now has dedicated brand focus that will drive international expansion at each of these segments. To sum it up, our top goals for 2014 are to accelerate our pace of global development and to turnaround our pizza U.S. business. We intend for Pizza Hut to ultimately become a double-digit profit grower for Yum! in the years ahead.","Finally, at Taco Bell, both same-store sales and margins declined in the first quarter while dealing with the challenging weather, higher commodity inflation, and the overlap of 6% positive same-store sales in 2013, which was our strongest quarter of last year. While the quarter was below our ongoing expectations, we remain confident Taco Bell has all kinds of mojo going forward as we expect another strong year. The big news for Taco Bell is that on March 27 that\u2019s the day which falls in the second quarter which went down in history as the day we launched our national breakfast platform. I am pleased to report we\u2019re off to a great start and we are generating tremendous buzz around our advertising and products. I encourage you to try our A.M. Crunchwrap, Waffle Taco, and Cinnabon Delights.","We have talked about products and talked about advertising and a breakfast line that is driving rave reviews for quality, affordability and value. Looking ahead, we\u2019ll be introducing mobile ordering at Taco Bell and we have significant innovation plan for our core business that we believe will wow our customers in 2014 including a major new product launch in the second half. Our ongoing product innovation is back by solid operations and strong unit economics, which allows us to open at least 100 net new units this year on top of 78 net new units we opened in 2013.","As you know our U.S. business represents 97% of Taco Bell\u2019s global profits. We now have a dedicated international leadership team and have made additional investments in G&A to unlock the enormous development opportunities in front us. Given the power of the brand in the U.S. and its success in several other markets we believe Taco Bell will eventually become our third global brand.","Taking a step back when you look at Yum! in total there are two important things to keep in mind; number one, we\u2019re largely a franchise business as over 90% of our restaurants outside of China are owned and operated by franchisees. In 2014 we will generate about $2 billion in franchise fees which is a $1 billion increase since 2004. We simply love the franchise business model as it\u2019s about as higher return business as you can possibly have; number two, Yum! Brands is the clear restaurant leader in emerging markets and we expect to build upon this position in the years ahead. And while we know emerging markets will have their ups and downs, we remain extremely bullish on our long-term prospects in these countries as the consuming class rapidly expands.","Remember emerging market economies are expected to grow at almost three times the rate of developed market economies for the foreseeable future. Also remember, we only have two restaurants per million people in emerging markets. This compares about 58 restaurants per million people in United States today. That\u2019s a long runway for growth and gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue our aggressive expansion for many years to come.","So let me wrap things up for Yum! Brands, on the whole we\u2019re off to a strong start to the year we\u2019re extremely pleased with our continued momentum in China and we had impressive results in a number of other markets. And as Pat will tell you on a new division basis we had a solid quarter at KFC, Taco Bell is off to a slow start but we\u2019re confident in the Brands positioning and plans balance of the year and we obviously have major work to do to get Pizza Hut on more competitive footing and we\u2019re confident we will do so.","All-in-all we believe we\u2019re well positioned to deliver on the three things we know that drive shareholder value in retail; driving new unit development, building same-store sales growth, and doing these in a way that generates high returns. We\u2019re confident we will have a strong bounce back year in 2014 growing EPS at least 20% and reestablish our track-record of consistently delivering double-digit earnings per share growth in the years ahead.","Now let me hand it over to Pat Grismer, our CFO.","Pat Grismer","Thank you, David and good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report strong first quarter EPS growth for Yum! Brands led by outstanding performance at our China division. This combined with current trends and balance of year initiatives for all our divisions gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance of at least 20% EPS growth excluding special items. We\u2019re also continuing to make investments that position us well to drive double-digit earnings growth for many years to come.","Today I\u2019ll provide some additional perspective on our first quarter results and share our outlook for the second quarter and full year. I\u2019ll then talk about what we\u2019re doing to drive long-term value for our shareholders. For the first quarter we reported 24% EPS growth before special items. This increase was led by significant sales, margin and profit growth at our China division. We also have solid operating performance at our new KFC division. However, these results were partially offset by disappointing results at our new Pizza Hut division and at our Taco Bell division which was adversely effected by unusually severe weather in the U.S.","Now I\u2019d like to dig a little deeper into each division\u2019s first quarter results. In China, operating profit increased by an impressive 80% prior to foreign currency translation. This performance was driven by same-store sales growth of 9% and nearly 7 points of restaurant margin improvement versus prior year. Given the challenges that we experienced in 2013, the single most important driver of a strong bounce back year for Yum! is continued sales improvement at our KFC business in China. With 11% same-store sales growth in the quarter it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re building momentum with this business and we\u2019re pleased with the overall progress we\u2019re making at KFC. Based on improving sales and the recovery we\u2019ve seen in key consumer metrics at KFC we reaffirm our 2014 guidance of high single to low double-digit same-store sales growth for the China division.","At Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China system sales grew 30% including unit growth of 23% and same-store sales growth of 8% for the quarter. We\u2019re confident 2014 will be another outstanding year for this business as we continue to accelerate new unit development, expand breakfast into more and more cities and leverage our assets even further throughout the day.","Now as pleased as we are with China sales I have to say we\u2019re even more pleased with China\u2019s restaurant margin topping 23% in the first quarter excluding an approximate half point negative impact of Little Sheep China division restaurant margin was actually slightly above what it was in the first quarter of 2012. This outstanding result reflects operating leverage from positive same-store sales, new pricing actions taken late last year and significant gains in restaurant productivity which further extend and build upon the efficiencies we realized in the second half of 2013. We continue to drive higher restaurant operating efficiency through improved store level sales forecasting, better labor scheduling and more effectively optimizing operating hours at selected locations. Importantly we\u2019ve accomplished this while maintaining our high standards of customer service. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank our China restaurant operations team for their breakthrough performance in achieving new levels of restaurant productivity.","Shifting to development, we opened 123 new restaurants in China during the quarter including 68 KFC\u2019s and 43 Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants. Over 70% of these new units were built in tier 3 through six cities where our unit economics and returns are strongest. So to summarize the progress we\u2019re making in our China business. At KFC we continue to see sequential improvement in same-store sales growth and consumer brand attribute scores are essentially back to 2012 levels. Additionally, we delivered strong restaurant margins in the quarter and are seeing significant improvement in new unit performance. At Pizza Hut Casual Dining we continue to have strong same-store sales growth with AUDs higher than KFC and full year margins above 20% we\u2019re generating two year cash payback.","We\u2019re aggressively investing behind this growth engine while also increasing our pace of development with Pizza Hut home service, which has compelling unit economics with a smaller investment. These results give us confidence that we\u2019ll not only achieve our full year target of high single to low double-digit same-store sales growth for our China division but we\u2019ll deliver significant full year margin improvement as well. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our progress and confident our China division will continue to be a major growth engine for Yum! Brands for many years to come.","Now let me talk about our three new global brand divisions, starting with KFC. Our new KFC division includes all KFC units outside of our China and India divisions. To put this division in perspective KFC division contributed 29% of Yum! total operating profit in 2013, 91% of which was generated outside the U.S. Additionally as of the end of Q1 91% of KFC stores were franchised.","For the quarter operating profit increased 4% excluding foreign currency translations. Operating profit growth was negatively impacted by 4 percentage points with the lap of one-time fees from a franchise ownership change in Malaysia in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding this item KFC\u2019s operating profit grew a solid 8%. In the quarter KFC opened 80 new restaurants including 77 new international units. Our franchisees continued to lead the way with development opening 88% of these new units. As a reminder similar to previous years we expect our new unit development will ramp-up significantly as the year progresses.","Same-store sales grew 1% in the quarter, these results were softer than we would have liked as weak performance in the U.S. and Thailand partially offset strong same-store sales performance in the UK, Russia, South Africa and the Middle East. In our international markets, same-store sales grew 3% in emerging markets and 1% in developed markets. In the United States same-store sales declined 3%. KFC operating margin was relatively flat versus prior year as the benefits of same-store sales growth and franchise development were offset by the prior year lap I mentioned, as well as a slight decline in Company restaurant margins.","Moving to our new Pizza Hut division, which includes all Pizza Hut units outside of our China and India divisions. Pizza Hut division contributed 15% of Yum! total operating profit in 2013, 54% of which was generated in the U.S. Additionally 94% of Pizza Hut units were franchised as of the end of Q1. First quarter operating profit declined 14% versus prior year. Operating profit growth was adversely effected by 5 percentage points from the lap of a UK pension plan benefit realized last year. Excluding this one-time item Pizza Hut\u2019s operating profit declined a disappointing 9%. Pizza Hut opened 69 new restaurants including 39 units opened outside the U.S., 87% of these new units were opened by our franchisees. Same-store sales declined 2% in the quarter driven by a 5% decline in the U.S. which accounts for about half of our Pizza Hut store base.","For our international markets same-store sales grew 3% in emerging markets and 1% in developed markets comparable to KFC. Pizza Hut operating margin decreased approximately 6 percentage points for the quarter due impart to the decline in same-store sales and about a 4 percentage point drop in Company restaurant margin. Additionally about 2 percentage points of the operating margin decline was attributable to the pension overlap I mentioned previously. The restaurant margin decline was driven by sales deleverage and higher than expected commodity inflation in our U.S. business, where as I mentioned before the majority of our Company stores are located.","We also made strategic investments in field level G&A to open new Pizza Hut markets and drive higher levels of development. As I\u2019ll explain later we don\u2019t expect first quarter results to be indicative of the Pizza Hut's performance balance of year.","Moving to our new Taco Bell division, which includes all Taco Bell units outside of our China and India divisions. Taco Bell division contributed 21% of Yum! total operating profit in 2013, 97% of which was generated in the U.S. And as of the end of Q1, 85% of Taco Bell stores were franchised. Taco Bell\u2019s reported results for the first quarter were clouded by a number of factors but we don\u2019t expect these results to be at all representative of the full year results.","First quarter operating profit declined 16% versus prior year with a same-store sales decline of 1% on the heels of eight consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth. We estimate that unusually severe U.S. weather impacted first quarter same-store sales by about 3 percentage point. Additionally, operating profit growth was negatively impacted by 5 percentage points due to a franchise incentive related to our national breakfast launch.","While operating profit was impacted more than you\u2019d expect on a 1% same-store sales decline, it\u2019s important to note that our Company stores are more heavily concentrated in weather impacted geographies and thus underperformed to system average. In addition to the incremental sales deleverage restaurant margin was further impacted by a relatively high mix of labor-intensive and promotional products as well as higher than expected commodity inflation.","This yielded about a 2.5 percentage point decline in restaurant margin for the quarter. We view this as a temporary phenomenon and expect second half performance to be much stronger than the first as innovation led sales growth, promotion led mix shift, and new pricing actions deliver improved margin performance balance of year. On the development front, Taco Bell opened 28 new restaurants in the quarter, and 27 of these new units opened by our franchisees.","So, in summary for Yum! Brands, our 24% EPS growth for the first quarter was consistent with the guidance that we provided in February to be roughly in line with our full year EPS target of at least 20%. And while our Taco Bell and Pizza Hut results were softer than we would have liked, this was more than offset by strong performance in our China division.","For the second quarter we expect EPS growth to be our highest of the year. Remember, in Q2 of last year, the KFC China poultry supply incident and news of avian flu weighed heavily on China division results making the second quarter our low point of the year from an EPS growth perspective. We\u2019ll have the benefit of overlapping these weak results this year, combined with a tailwind from upward sales momentum at KFC in China and continued strength in China restaurant margins.","We also expect a much better sales results from Taco Bell with our recent breakfast launch. However Q2 profit growth of Taco Bell will be moderate as commodity inflation will continue to pressure restaurant margins although not to the extent we saw in the first quarter. And finally we expect KFC to remain solid and Pizza Hut to show improvement in the second quarter.","Now, before I talk about full year expectations, I want to provide some context for China restaurant margins and how we see this evolving balance of year. First, I want to caution you not to extrapolate our first quarter margin gain to the full year. Bear in mind that with respect to China restaurant margin, Q1 marks our easiest overlap of the year. Additionally, we began to implement new productivity measures during the second quarter of 2013, so we\u2019ll begin to overlap some of those benefits this quarter. And finally we just launched an extensive menu revamp which will add some initial labor complexity including training cost and a slightly higher food cost mix.","All that said, we\u2019re confident in our ability to make significant full year margin gains in China. In addition to the labor efficiencies I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve continued to optimize operating hours at KFC and are seeing stronger new unit margins with the increasing weight of our development program towards lower tier cities and towards Pizza Hut Casual Dining. We also took about 3 points of pricing at KFC and 2 points of pricing at Pizza Hut Casual Dining late last year which should benefit the full year.","At our December investor meeting, we indicated that China division margin would improve between 1 and 3 percentage points from 2013\u2019s full year restaurant margin as about 15%. Based on our strong start to the year and each of the items I just mentioned, and with expected full year division, same-store sales in the high single to low double-digit range we\u2019ve guided, I\u2019m confident that China division\u2019s restaurant margin will be at least 17% for the full year.","So now let me share our expectations for the full year 2014, which as I mentioned last quarter, will look different from our ongoing growth model. This year we expect the growth rate for our China division to be significantly above its ongoing target of 15% this year, or about 40%. As sales at KFC China continue to improve, we expect China division restaurant margins will continue to benefit from operating leverage as well as from productivity initiatives and pricing. We also expect another strong year at Pizza Hut Casual Dining and on the development front we expect to open at least another 700 new units in 2014.","Looking at our new brand divisions, we expect KFC\u2019s growth rate to be above its ongoing target of 10%, Pizza Hut\u2019s growth rate to be below its ongoing target of 8% and Taco Bell to be in line with its ongoing target of 6%, just as we mentioned in December. And while Taco Bell and Pizza Hut both had a slow start to the year, we expect Taco Bell to make this up in the balance of the year with a strong second half supported by breakfast, new product innovation, digital initiatives and additional pricing actions. However, it\u2019s likely that Pizza Hut will trail our previous expectations although we do expect significant improvement from our first half as we sharpen our marketing, improve our digital execution and accelerate the pace of new unit development globally all enabled by our new global brand structure. When you add it all up, we expect at least 20% EPS growth in 2014.","Now before we open up the call to questions, I\u2019d like to talk about how we\u2019re financially wired to generate strong returns for our shareholders. First with the strong and steadily growing cash flow that we generate from our global franchise business and from our high return equity businesses, we reinvest a substantial portion about 40% in new growth opportunities, largely new store openings. With the changes we\u2019ve made to our store ownership profile over the years, there are a combination of new equity businesses and refranchising, these new stores are increasingly skewed to emerging markets which offer superior returns and significant growth potential thus laying a strong foundation for future earnings growth.","Second, we pay a dividend which we\u2019ve grown at a double-digit rate every year since we first paid a dividend over 9 years ago, making us one of only 10 companies in the S&P 500 to do so. This has delivered an annual dividend yield of about 2% which is very competitive for a Company with our growth profile. Third, we don\u2019t hold cash, after covering our growth investments and dividends, we return all available cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Based on the track-record of our staff over the years, it\u2019s fair to say that these buybacks have created enormous value for our shareholders.","All three of these levers growth investment, growing dividend and value creating share repurchases work together to drive strong returns for our shareholders. So let me wrap things up. We\u2019re pleased with our strong first quarter results, specifically at our China division. It\u2019s evident, that the actions we took in 2013 to strengthen our business coupled with our ongoing growth investments have set us up for a strong bounce back in 2014.","Looking at our three new global divisions, KFC is off to a solid start, Pizza Hut is in turnaround mode and Taco Bell\u2019s year will be more of a first half, second half story as we continue to build momentum with this exciting brand. In addition, we continue to strengthen our position in high growth emerging markets, as we capitalize on the low levels of unit penetration and the growth of the emerging economies. I am confident in the strength of our business model and we\u2019ll continue to make the investments necessary to sustain double-digit EPS growth over the long-term.","And with that, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Pat, can I ask you to elaborate a little bit on the China margin comments. I mean effectively saying up at least 17%, you are staying within the high range of the prior 130 to 300 basis points improvement over 2013. So, kind of would you walk through some of the key elements, food cost inflation, labor inflation, may be what you saw on both of those in the first quarter, what you\u2019re thinking for the second quarter and what you\u2019re thinking for the balance of the year?","Pat Grismer","I am very happy to do that Joe. As a reminder, I mean our Q1 margin in China improved about 7 points, more improvement in KFC than in Pizza Hut but both improved. Same-store sales contributed about 6 points of margin improvement which included about 3 points from pricing with the balance from sales mix and transaction leverage. Importantly transaction, same-store transactions grew in both brands. We also got a 3 point margin benefit from restaurant level labor productivity and our new unit development program also improved our division margin by about a 1 point. So, when you add those up that\u2019s about 10 points of margin benefit, offsetting that was about 2 points of pressure from inflation that included relatively flat commodities and about 7% inflation in labor and another margin point of pressure from Little Sheep and from rent. And so when you add those together that\u2019s how you get to about 7 points improvement in the division.","Now, as I mentioned we don\u2019t want anyone to extrapolate that to the balance of the year, but based on everything we\u2019ve outlined in terms of the ongoing momentum in our sales, the continued productivity initiatives, pricing actions that may happen balance of year plus what we know about the commodity outlook. We do expect to be at, at least 17% for the full year which is about 2 points better than last year\u2019s full year results.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Pat, what are you expecting for commodities and waiver, I mean can you just describe here for the second quarter and then for the balance of the year?","Pat Grismer","Yes well, we do expect commodity inflation to edge up a bit. Our full year guidance is in line with what we communicated in New York, which is low single-digits. Labor, admittedly was a little bit light on inflation in the quarter at 7%. We still expect on a full year basis to be in the low double-digit. So we expect that labor inflation will nudge up over the course of the year.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Joe. Joana next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company","Thank you. I\u2019ve just got two questions, one on China and one on Taco Bell. For China, can you just talk a little bit more about the restage here, just the new menu in the marketing, between the higher cost of sales mix and the investment in training, first question is how many basis points, do you think this will be a headwind of margins versus what we saw on the first quarter? And also anything you can say on the sales reaction since the restage would also be helpful.","Steve Schmitt","So Brian, this is Steve. On the menu restage, it\u2019s too early to tell exactly with precision what the impact will be on food cost, but we do expect it to be slightly higher based on our expected mix. And from a labor standpoint, I don\u2019t think there will be a very material piece of increase in the labor line, but with any new product offering there will be labor training cost that will hit in the second quarter.","David Novak","I think just from an overall marketing standpoint, we launched the new menu on the 26th. We began the national advertising on the 2nd. The overall objective is to restage KFC as even more youthful, more energetic and renovating along with the ever change that\u2019s going on in China. The fact is that we launched 15 products simultaneously, that\u2019s our first time we\u2019ve have ever done that in KFC\u2019s 27 year history and I don\u2019t think anybody in the QSR industry has done that. We basically tried to steal a page out of the successful Pizza Hut playbook where we revamped the menu twice a year, 20% of the menu twice a year. And of the 15 products, 15 of the products are either new or they are returns of popular items that we\u2019ve previously only offered like on a limited time-only basis.","There are as I said in my remarks are four signature product platforms sandwiches, rice dishes, snacks, drinks and desserts. So we\u2019re obviously increasing the amount of variety that\u2019s offered at KFC. And while it\u2019s early we\u2019re pleased with the initial results. We\u2019ve had great consumer feedback on our new roasted chicken burger, our teriyaki chicken flavored rice, flavored roast wings, we got a great drink that seems to be very popular, sparkling apple juice that people really are responding very favorably to.","One of the things we\u2019re trying to do this year is really take the offense and bring a lot of fun and excitement back to the KFC. Last year we were in the defensive position. And this year we\u2019re really trying to bring fun and excitement. We\u2019ve signed four very popular youthful celebrities. We got digital marketing and engagement and we\u2019ve already had 7 million likes in the past three weeks. So we feel good about that.","And this is a very holistic approach that we\u2019re taking in the restage. If you walk into our restaurants today, you\u2019re going to see new team members, with new contemporary uniforms that they really like. We\u2019re rolling out new packaging. As we speak we have new menu boards. We\u2019re adding Wi-Fi and at lot of our restaurants with the ultimate goal to have all of them, over 2,000 restaurants with Wi-Fi by the end of the year. And we\u2019ve got digital mobile applications coming. So this is a holistic approach, we\u2019re really trying to drive a lot of excitement, a lot of news behind the KFC brand. And I think just the fact that you get 7 million likes from your marketing now in three weeks. This shows how big and ubiquitous this brand really is, I mean people love the brand. As you guys all know, if you follow this, we\u2019ve been ranked the number one brand in China for a number of years. And so that strength has never left us, and what we\u2019re trying to do is just leverage it even more as we go into the future. So I\u2019m very excited about KFC, the progress that we\u2019re making, and the progress that we\u2019ll continue to make.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Brian. Joana next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Hi, good morning. Another question on the China business, maybe more specifically, I think, you used the words upward momentum in the KFC business. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us maybe a directional update on what you\u2019re seeing so far in Q2 in terms of the comp for either KFC or the division?","David Novak","Yes David, we never really give out specific numbers as it relates to current trends. However, what we have conveyed is that we\u2019re very encouraged by not only the results we saw in Q1, but how those results have sustained into Q2 and what we see to be the early response to the compounds every stage of the KFC brand. In my view comps don\u2019t tell the whole story one of the things we look at is the absolute average -- we view seasonalized transaction volumes and what we see there are sequential improvements and it\u2019s based on Q1 results and what we observed from current trends they give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for same-store sales growth of high single to low double-digit growth.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then may be another question on the margins it seems like you\u2019ve gotten a lot of encouraging productivity enhancements and I\u2019m just wondering where you are in the stage of that initiative whether you think you\u2019ve gotten all that you\u2019re going to get or if there is more on the table in terms of productivity gains?","David Novak","Well as I mentioned we started to initiate these productivity measures in the second quarter of last year so as we make our way into Q2 we\u2019ve began to overlap some of those. However, we also think that our momentum on some newer productivity measures towards the end of last year and also continued into this year. So we expect that productivity will be a significant contributor to our full year margin performance although we wouldn\u2019t extrapolate the gains from Q1 to the full year. But from a number of things so it\u2019s not been any one thing that has driven that result we are much sharper in the way we\u2019ve forecast sales at store level that puts us in a position to do a much better job of scheduling our labor so that we\u2019re more efficient in a way that we deliver service to our customers. And we continue to rationalize operating hours at selected restaurants in ways that ensure that we\u2019re growing profitable transactions increasing new profitable transactions all of this things really have come together to deliver what we consider to be an outstanding result and will help us achieve that at least 17% restaurant margin for the division this year.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Thank you.","Pat Grismer","The only thing I\u2019d add on that is that the mindset we have in our Company is it\u2019s always the unfinished business on the productivity gains and we\u2019re going to -- we're constantly looking at every process in the ways to incrementally improvement it and hopefully make quantum lead for whatever we can. So we\u2019re organized globally around operations best practice sharing I think anything that we pick up in any market that works we share with other markets and we expect to make continued progress on this front.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks David. Next question please Joana.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Eric Larson - RBC Capital Markets","This is Eric Larson for Dave Palmer, just want to ask you two quick questions here. You\u2019ve got a new menu in marketing in the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut which is likely to impact the second quarter. Are you seeing an acceleration in any of these divisions lately, any numbers or additional color on how these initiatives would be pretty helpful. And then also would like to ask you about your repurchase plans and targeted leverage in the near-term? Thanks.","David Novak","Well, I think on the Taco Bell point as you know we just launched breakfast we\u2019re very pleased with the initial results it\u2019s too early to really go in the details on that. At Pizza Hut we\u2019ve recently launched Garlic Parmesan Pizzas and WingStreet and we\u2019re pleased with the results that we\u2019ve had out of both those products. But I can\u2019t really give you any specifics on the actual sales trends.","Pat Grismer","And then on the financial structure question with respect to the purchases consistent with what we outlined in New York we expect share repurchases to contribute about a 1 point of EPS growth so we\u2019re still on-track to do that. And then as it relates to our capital structure we\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re at how we\u2019re positioned from a leverage perspective and as you know we completed a successful refinancing of about $600 million of debt in the fourth quarter of last year which we believe created significant value for our shareholders so we\u2019re happy with way things stand on a capital structure basis. This is something we continue to look at and we believe that we\u2019re in the sweet spot.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Eric. Joana next question please.","Operator","Yes. Your next question comes from Jeff Farmer. Your line is open.","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities","Just touching on Taco Bell breakfast again in a little bit different angle here so I am just curious what you have learned about your Taco Bell breakfast customer over more of the extended test period. So are these existing customers coming into the restaurant are they increasing your frequency or again are you tracking new customers altogether and does a breakfast visit from a Taco Bell customer some of these really loyal do you see them essentially doubling down coming to the restaurant twice on some occasions how should we think about that Taco Bell customer and breakfast?","David Novak","Well first of all on the test markets and what we\u2019ve seen to-date the business is incremental okay so it\u2019s entering the incremental usage. Now the great thing about Taco Bell is that Taco Bell users are heavy breakfast users, I think they compose a 75% of the heavy breakfast users it\u2019s an amazing number. So just getting people converted into Taco Bell users to breakfast for a new different incremental occasion that\u2019s really our closest in opportunity, I was just in Phoenix a couple of weeks ago where we\u2019ve been in test for two years and what was startling to me was how many people didn\u2019t know we were in breakfast until we launched our new advertising.","So I think what we learned in the last couple of years is we can get a profitable proposition but it\u2019s really going to challenging to break through the clutter and get people to be aware of your breakfast offerings and get them to try. We think we\u2019ve really done that with the recent advertising which is very talked about and when I was talking to customers they were saying that they\u2019ve seen the advertising and enjoyed it and they came in and tried it. And I think the good news we feel the things that were most and we learned this from test markets and also with the launch people love our products. I think we\u2019ve got, if you look at the A.M. Crunchwrap it\u2019s very portable, it\u2019s the most portable breakfast product in the category, and it\u2019s been tested up against of a like product with competition and we win with better value, the waffle taco, is similar. I mean there is nothing like a waffle taco, it\u2019s a novelty product in the sense that it is just so interesting, if you just go online people are talking about both of the A.M. Crunchwrap.","And the Cinnabon Delights, I don\u2019t think you can eat just one. I mean these things are great. And we\u2019ve developed, one of the things we\u2019ve realized we needed to have in breakfast in test markets we need to have a good coffee line of products. And we\u2019ve had great coffee with flavored options which people really like. And we think that that segment will grow overtime.","The good thing is, is that our franchisees are very excited about this. They are excited about in Phoenix I was in Columbia and Missouri just last week, I was meeting with our franchisees they have 17 stores, they were I think actually doubting Thomas is a breakfast. But I think they have been converted because the people really liked the products. So you have products, good value, minimum investment. Remember we were able to do this with the significant capital expenditures. So we think we\u2019re off and running, we want to emphasize that we know this is not lay down. I mean I just could talk about in fact we were in Phoenix, when I was in Phoenix and we\u2019ve been there for two years and people didn\u2019t even know until we announced we have already achieved breakeven and you are at a solid breakfast platform to go forward with, but customers didn\u2019t know about it.","So we got to break major habits, I mean people have a tendency to do the same thing every day and so we got to -- it's hard to even to get our current users to give this a try. But I think the team is doing a very innovative and exciting ways from a marketing standpoint. We actually train for breakfast. We did more training for the breakfast roll out than anything was ever done from an operational standpoint. We had rallies all around the United States, the team\u2019s pumped up. We\u2019re not in it to be in breakfast, we\u2019re in to win a breakfast.","And we\u2019re going to -- we have great products today that have gotten us into the game, we have a lot more products that we can go to and when we want to, that are derivatives to what we\u2019ve done plus some new products. So early days I don\u2019t want to get too excited about it, okay because we know the challenges is immense but I have always said that we can be successful if breakfast and we fully intend to be, there is no reason in the world why Taco Bell can\u2019t go from 5,000 stores to 8,000 stores in the United States. So our goal is to add that $100,000 plus concept layer that really takes already a high returning business to a whole different level and we get much more rapid new unit development. This year we\u2019ll have over 100 net new units at Taco Bell on top of I think around 80 last year. So we\u2019re picking up speed, the development pipeline is getting better and the enthusiasm is very high on this, but the proof is still in the pudding.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Jeff. Next question please Joana.","Operator","Yes. Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Hi, thanks. I\u2019d like to take the opportunity to ask two questions if I may. First philosophically when you look at China margins, it does look like labor hours per store was actually down in the first quarter and that\u2019s despite the higher traffic that you say at the brand, and cost of goods sold was the lowest I could find. I mean at least back 10 years maybe even more than that in the division. So, in kind of the context of having a recovery and trying to do a better job for your customer and the employee, is there any thought of reinvesting some of that margin in giving a better store level experience or does it, kind of what we saw in the first quarter in letting the store level economics really earn, is that the right thing for you guys to pursue over the next couple of years? And I ask that of course in the context of getting back to a 20% margin which I think was your long-term goal a few years ago.","David Novak","Well we fully expect to overtime to get back to that 20% margin that\u2019s the goal. And we think we\u2019re going to get there primarily through sales leverage. As we take the sales up we think that\u2019ll be the number one beneficiary. The one thing that we believe more than anything is and we\u2019ve done this from day one in China is we will never sacrifice the customer experience for any kind of margin. That\u2019s just not going to happen. I mean we in the last four months, we\u2019ve retrained every one of our team members on our standards okay on our expectations on what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re investing in the consumer proposition and our customer majors all say that we\u2019ve been able to do it quite successfully. And the magic of this business is the magic at the end. You want to get the sales growth you want to get to margin growth. And that\u2019s what I think they are demonstrating we have the capability to do there, but make no mistake about it. The primary thing we have to do is make our customers happy.","I mean we got to make our customers happy and bring them back again and again and again. One of the things we train people on John is a branded experience. And let me give you an example of that, when you -- what we\u2019re focused on is branded service in China. And this is part of the restage and I didn\u2019t talk about it, but I\u2019m glad you bring it up because it does have operational implications and we\u2019ve taken the time to train everybody on this. So when you walk into store in China everybody raises their hands. Automatically and says n\u01d0 h\u01ceo. Okay. You\u2019re welcomed as a customer.","We\u2019ve learned that one of the things we want to do is we want to make our customers feel valued, so when we take the money from and give the money back to our customers we give it them with two hands. Okay. That\u2019s just a recent thing that we just added because we want to help people and we thank people for coming and just like they do at Chick-fil-A. It\u2019s been a pleasure serving you. We actually picked that up from Chick-fil-A here in the United States. We built that into our brand of service experience.","So those are just two things that we\u2019re trying to do every single time so that the customer feels it, so I think the big to think about are restage is that this is a -- we look at everything we do to make it better for the customer more product variety more better uniform, better environment through the things Wi-Fi. We\u2019re also this year we\u2019ll be consistently upgrading our restaurants in a number of stores in major cities and showing designs that we\u2019ve created. So the only way you enter a long-term and the short-term obviously is you\u2019ve got to make customers happy. And we\u2019re on just a mission to do that. So I think we are investing. I know we\u2019re investing in the customer proposition.","Pat Grismer","Specifically to get at your question around what was happening with cost of sales when you look at the year-over-year decline. You may recall that last year in the wake of the challenges we experienced at the end of 2012, we introduced some value offers, some discount offers in an effort to stimulate traffic. So we\u2019re laughing perhaps this year. Also as I mentioned, we took some new pricing actions at the end of 2013 after going without pricing at KFC for over a year. And we thought that we\u2019re going to do that based on the recovery that we saw in the key consumer metrics and good news is at end of the first quarter, our value scores continue to be very good and we\u2019ve maintained our pricing on the value anchors which are critical to maintaining a strong value position with consumers.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","And of course I\u2019m not sure you do appreciate the question, but when you look at record gross margins and declining labor hours per store you at least have to ask a question whether in fact that customer value position is going up and if you say it is, it is?","David Novak","I\u2019ve always appreciated your knowledge as a category, John.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","No. Thank you, David. And secondly, if I may -- on your KFC and thank you for the transparency it\u2019s great. I mean I\u2019d love to see it, but when you look at the Company store margins there and especially with the majority of Company stores outside of the United States, could you give -- is there is a different experience that the Company stores are seeing in KFC versus for example the franchisees and obviously you don\u2019t pay a royalty in those Company stores for KFC, so are the franchisees seeing different economics on the margin side as those franchisees grow because I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be growing many KFC stores with the margins in the low double-digits?","Steve Schmitt","John, this is Steve the economics still remains strong and in fact the comment we actually took our international build number up and that\u2019s the number that\u2019s both for KFC and for Pizza Hut from our initial guidance. So, their economics are strong and we continue to expect strong development.","I\u2019m sorry, John. Bear in mind what you\u2019re seeing is a global average, right. And there are differences in the profitability of new units and emerging versus developed markets and where more of our growth is coming from is in the emerging markets where the unit development is stronger, where the unit returns are strong.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","And if you\u2019ve done this before, I apologize, but can you quantify that difference of the kind of the growth markets versus the established markets?","Steve Schmitt","And we\u2019ve talked about paybacks before especially in some emerging markets and they\u2019re very attractive. There are very attractive returns if they weren\u2019t the franchisees would be growing.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","I understand. Thank you so much for the time.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, John. Next question please, Joana?","David Novak","Remember we\u2019re going to have across the board we\u2019ll have record levels of development this year, 150 international units outside of China and that only comes if you have -- remember 90% of what we outside of China is franchise-owned. So they\u2019re only going to invest if they\u2019re going to be getting good returns. And I think the important point is that the margins that you see that there are low are primarily in the developed markets and the emerging markets we get cash-on-cash returns within two to four years. Okay.","Steve Schmitt","Next question please, Joana?","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open.","Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets","Well, thank you. I\u2019d like to follow-up on the KFC China restaging and I appreciate the focus on being more youthful and energetic in the 15 new products, but to ask you slightly differently, is this restaging in these new products, is this outright menu extension, is it more premium focused more value, is there any change in the main part focus any color on that and I guess Pat what I\u2019d ask you is, do you expect any mix impact from this restaging on how your same-store sales develops throughout the year? Thanks.","David Novak","I think that first of all these products are more premium in nature they\u2019re not value products, so they\u2019re high quality premium priced products. Okay. We now have I think have 66 total options at KFC compared to 59 that we had before. We removed 7 items updated 1 and we increased. And so I think we tried to optimize our menu, but the product themselves are more premium in nature and one of the things we\u2019re doing in China is we want to add entry price points, they are very value oriented and effective with lunch and dinner, okay. So, that RMB 6 breakfast, we will have some RMB 6 breakfast, we\u2019ll have some RMB 15 lunches and then so we have the entry price point but we want to obviously you want to give people, you want to trade people up as much as you can in the higher quality products and that\u2019s really what our focus is. We\u2019re really going for quality transactions.","Pat Grismer","And Keith to your follow-on question regarding the impact that the new menu could have to our margin, it\u2019s early days but we expect that as we mentioned before that it will drive some or put some pressure on the food cost and labor but not to an extent that it\u2019s going to change our strong outlook for margin improvement balance of year. And in fact we expect the sales leverage coming from the promotion combined with the ongoing productivity initiatives to really dominate the margin story for the year.","Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets","And Pat as far as the mix impacts are in terms of same-store sales, I mean it sounds like especially given that this is premium besides from the margin impact, it does sound like there could be positive mix benefit from this as\u2026","Pat Grismer","I mean from a check, average check perspective?","Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets","Exactly.","Pat Grismer","Yes. But as we mentioned, we maintained the strong value offer on the menu as well, so it\u2019s not, although we are moving away from value, I think it\u2019s the power of doing both.","Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets","Thank you.","Pat Grismer","Thanks, Keith.","Steve Schmitt","Next question please Joana.","Operator","And your next question comes from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question about Taco Bell, I mean it looked like in the first quarter, you talk about promotional spend and franchisee incentive. Can you talk about kind of whether or not in light of the -- whether or not that was processes through the year and how successful breakfast needs to be for you to be able to hit your kind of ongoing growth algorithm, and I know you talked about $100,000 was kind of the incremental sales layer but I am just trying to figure out this year what the puts and takes there are on the margin with respect to breakfast? And then I also had a quick follow-up question, outside of Taco Bell, if I look at the margin for Pizza Hut and KFC globally recognizing that there were some one-times. I think in the past you said that there is an opportunity there when those were reported as part of YRI to get company operated margin may be a lot higher. Is that still the case?","Pat Grismer","Let\u2019s deal with the Taco Bell question first, Sara. With respect to our expectations around breakfast and what we\u2019re seeing today, we\u2019ve been targeting mid to high single-digit mix for breakfast that\u2019s generally what we saw in the test. And to David\u2019s point earlier that was highly incremental and that\u2019s probably what we\u2019re seeing in the early days of the launch in breakfast. How it\u2019s going to impact our margin, so that\u2019s the sales piece and so if we achieve and we maintain that mid to high single-digit mix for breakfast that\u2019s what we need to deliver our same-store sales growth targets for the year. In terms of the margin piece, the breakfast offer at that mix level is slightly dilutive to margin but only slightly. For us, this is an opportunity to establish an entirely day part that is highly incremental that as it builds overtime it\u2019s going to be overall accretive to our margins. And therefore as David pointed out earlier, will put us in the position to accelerate the pace of new unit development.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein"," ","Understood. And then on Pizza Hut and KFC.","Pat Grismer","Well I think the important thing to keep in mind is that in those businesses in the U.S. we have very low levels of Company ownership even internationally. So, franchise development dominates those two brands particularly in emerging markets, we do expect overtime to see those margins improve particularly as our Company store base is increasingly skewed to those emerging markets which offer the benefit of better restaurant level economics with lower labor and lower rent. So, overtime as we pick up the pace of development with the Company stores and emerging markets and those form a higher proportion of our total equity store base, we continue to target margins for KFC and for Pizza Hut, so it will take us into the mid-teen territory.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Sara. Next question please Joana.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Yes, thanks guys. Just on the China recovery and particularly KFC, the 11 comp in the quarter, can you talk about kind of how that looks within the two tier groups that you look at, were you are seeing similar recovery in tier 1 and 2 versus 3 to 6 and just overall thoughts on as -- it looks like your brand score is back to normal but the comps on the two year is still pretty negative. Just to -- why the big discrepancy there between the recovery and where the brand scores are? Thanks.","Pat Grismer","Yes certainly, Jason. On the sales side city tier, there was modest variability in KFC same-store sales growth across the city tiers with the results strongest in tier 1 cities particularly Shanghai because you will remember that\u2019s where we experienced the steepest sales declines in the first quarter of 2013. So, there was a stronger lapping benefit if you will, in tier 1 cities Shanghai in particular. So, there was modest variability there not so much on the Pizza Hut side.","And then in terms of the two year comps, as I mentioned before, I don\u2019t know that the comps tell the whole story. They become difficult to read, based on the variable lap of the two and three year comps and so forth. We have looked at both. But what I really hang my head on is absolute transaction volumes on a de-seasonalized basis. And this is something that we study, from month-to-month, to really see how we are tracking with our business. And what we\u2019re seeing is continued improvement and upward momentum in that measure. That\u2019s what gives me confidence along with the consumer metrics, that the business is steadily recovering. And overall we\u2019re pleased with where we are at and the progress we\u2019re making, again not only in sales, but importantly the profitability of the sales and how they work together to deliver the bounce back in operating profit.","Our goal this year is to get to that high to single to low double-digit same-store sales growth and about 40% operating profit growth in our China division. And frankly we don\u2019t need heroic same-store sales here in China that -- high single to low double-digit growth is fine. What we want to do is to do is put forward -- get our business back on the right footing, get more consumer excitement back, and we prefer to grow on solid controlled manner this year, and then build off the space. So we\u2019re basically focused on building the business, the right way for the long-term. And I think we are making continual improvement with KFC and I think we\u2019re basically on-track.","Steve Schmitt","Thank you, Jason. Joana next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Jake Bartlett - Morgan Stanley","Hi, this is Jake Bartlett on for John. I have a quick question on COGS, and you levered it more than we would have expected with the pricing that you had in the flat inflation. Was it just lapping discounting of last year? And then on those, along that line, going forward do you expect this kind of benefiting in the quarters going forward or should we just kind of as a normal interplay between pricing in our inflation expectations?","Pat Grismer","Jake, in future quarters we would expect to return to a more normal pattern. So Q1 was unusual as I mentioned because we had some pretty extreme discount offers in Q1 of last year in effort to stimulate transactions that we\u2019re getting a lapping benefit and so we saw average spend grow, from that more than we would expect in a normal quarter. On top of the fact, as you mentioned, that we had the new pricing actions come into a quarter where food inflation was flat.","Jake Bartlett - Morgan Stanley","So it\u2019s not about an ongoing say theoretical food cost system, or some sort of productivity gains here, or just efficiency gains here your achieving at the food cost level?","Pat Grismer","No.","Jake Bartlett - Morgan Stanley","And then, in terms of the restage, you mentioned customer experience. Is that involving a re-image of source, can you just remind us?","Pat Grismer","Well I think we\u2019re building off a powerful image, the number one brand in China, all we\u2019re basically doing is trying to invigorate it and show and demonstrate that we\u2019re\u2026","Jake Bartlett - Morgan Stanley","I meant remodels, some sort of a remodel program in China?","Pat Grismer","Okay. We just we constantly remodel every 5 to 7 years; that we just have new designs that we\u2019ll be rolling out this year.","Jake Bartlett - Morgan Stanley","Got you.","Steve Schmitt","Thank you. Joana next question please.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good thanks guys. This is Erwin on for Jeff. Just really quickly on the China consumers, or let\u2019s say is confidence in sentiment, are you seeing any changes in the consumer willingness to dine out or maybe in their habits in anyway, I mean also on the broader industry sales versus KFC, that you still see yourself lagging, because of the supply issue or have you kind of regained the lost kind of some of the losses and kind of brought yourself more in line with the category even outperforming? Thanks.","Pat Grismer","Well, certainly on a reported basis, given the strong bounce back in Q1 helped by the last year, we\u2019re outperforming the category from a quarterly growth perspective. I would say that the macro situation hasn\u2019t been changed versus last year. It continues to grow overall. And I think when you look at the fact that we had good, very solid results with our Pizza Hut Casual Dining business, that\u2019s a further indication that when you have a concept that is well-positioned and well executed, consumers are going to come. So we\u2019re delighted with the results that we\u2019re getting and as we said we see the China business to be an important one for us for the long run. And even though 7% growth in GDP is lower than it was in recent years. It remains the fastest growing a large economy in the world, and we\u2019ve got a leading position there, so we\u2019re very happy with that.","Steve Schmitt","Thank you. Joana next question please.","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Andy Barish - Jefferies","Hey guys, just wondering about the food inflation, commodity inflation uptick in the U.S. business looked noticeable obviously in Taco Bell which is predominantly domestic. Can you give us some thoughts on that, and then your pricing actions for later this year in terms of the scope of that, and was that initially anticipated or sort of a reaction to some of this commodity ramp?","Pat Grismer","Well, there is no doubt that commodities have played out very differently from what we thought. In New York you\u2019ll recall, we came into the year expecting 4% inflation in meat and 4% deflation in cheese. Things could not have played out any differently as we\u2019re expecting low to mid double-digit inflation in beef, it was up high single-digit in the first quarter. And then for cheese, we\u2019re expecting now mid single-digit inflation it was up over 20% in the first quarter. So, it has played out very differently and so yes that has played into our pricing actions this year. And that we intend to do balance of year but this is one of the things where we continue to read the business in terms of how consumers are responding to our value offers and to our new product innovation and the progress we continue to make on productivity initiatives and then we determine what we need to do by way of pricing in order to maintain and improve margin so that we have a strong investible position that is going to underwrite future unit growth. So, yes, the commodity situation in the U.S. is proving to be a challenging one but we\u2019re dealing with it just as we have for the last 50 years.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Andy. Next question please Joana.","Operator","Your next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","Good morning.","Pat Grismer","Good morning.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","I wanted to ask you about opportunities on re-franchising just where you stand I think there is still some opportunity on the Taco Bell side? And then when you look at the China market overall where do you see yourself basically three to five years from now in terms of do you see more franchising chance to refranchise there particularly as that market matures and you get bigger in India for instance or do you still see a company-owned operating model in China over the longer time?","Pat Grismer","The philosophy we\u2019ve always had is to earn the right to own. And wherever we own stores we\u2019ve earned the right to own with the exceptions in some markets and countries where we own a few stores just so we can lead for test markets. But if you take a look at Taco Bell, we\u2019ve actually reduced our ownership in Taco Bell with past few years and now it\u2019s about 15% where the Taco Bell has margins that end of last year close to 20% these are clearly the shareholder benefits by some of those restaurants. So that\u2019s the mentality that we have. We look at all of our equity on a constant basis and make sure that the investing we\u2019re making in terms of running the store well exceeds our cost of capital.","Steve Schmitt","And specifically to the businesses as you mentioned Diane in the Taco Bell 15% that\u2019s our target, so there isn\u2019t more refranchising opportunity that we see there and we\u2019re generally happy with the returns we\u2019re getting on those new investments and we believe it\u2019s a strong equity position for us. And as far as China is concerned, we have been doing some modest amount of refranchising for the last several years. We see that continuing so we expect that we\u2019ll continue to maintain that ownership percentage to David\u2019s point though under the banner of earning the right to own given extraordinary returns we\u2019re seeing on new unit development with our KFC and Pizza Hut and coming up now Pizza Hut home service, we think it\u2019s a great place to own and operate restaurants. It creates enormous value for our shareholders. But we see China being predominantly equity for many years to come although we\u2019re looking very aggressively at franchising as a way to accelerate even more growth as we go forward.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","That\u2019s terrific. Thank you.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Diane. Next question please Joana.","Operator","Your next question comes from R. J. Hottovy with Morningstar. Your line is open.","R. J. Hottovy - Morningstar","Yes thanks. Just wanted to drill down a little bit more into the takeaway some in global brand strategic reviews. More specifically discussing KFC and your ability to take the learnings from the successful developed markets like the UK and Australia and apply them to North America. One, what type of initiatives do you have planned; and two, how do you plan to communicate those to the franchisees? Thanks.","Pat Grismer","Well, I think what we -- when you look at the UK business and the Australia business KFC in particular you\u2019ve got two very successful businesses that are more in the portable food arena particularly with sandwiches. So we\u2019re looking at how we can take some of those learnings and develop a right sandwich platform and be effective in the United States and in that arena as well. I think we constantly share product news that travels, so any new product that is developed in Australia or the UK would move to the U.S. one of the things for example is boxed meals were successful in Australia and we\u2019ve moved them into the U.S. trying to target a $5 price point. And I think when we were organized separately the U.S. teams didn\u2019t really work as closely with the international teams as we\u2019d like and we\u2019re going to see a lot more sharing and I think adoption with those teams together now reporting in the separate or focused CEOs.","Steve Schmitt","Thank, R. J. I think we have one final question, Joana.","Operator","Your last question comes from Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.","Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group","Great. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to Taco Bell breakfast I think you\u2019d mentioned $100,000 incremental layer from the breakfast just curious in test how long did that take for the franchisees to kind of get to that breakeven level?","Pat Grismer","Well as you know we\u2019ve been developing our breakfast layer for a number of years. Evolving the menu to understand what is going to resonate most with consumers and be perceived as a highly differentiated offering. So we\u2019ve made a number of changes to the menu over that period over that period of time and it\u2019s been with this most recent offering that\u2019s been an active development and test for the last call it 18 to 24 months that we\u2019ve seen the best results that have now given us the confidence to go national. And as we mentioned it was in the those tests that we achieved the mid to high single-digit mix that we needed in order to make the economics work for us and we\u2019re very pleased and encouraged by the early results we\u2019re seeing from the program which are generally in line with what we saw in test.","Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group","Great, thank you very much.","Pat Grismer","Thanks Peter.","David Novak","Okay let me just wrap-up. I think we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to have a strong bounce back year in 2014. And we\u2019re going to grow our earnings per share at least 20% and we look forward to reestablishing our track-record of consistently delivering double-digit EPS growth in the years ahead. As we go into the balance of the year, we have significant building blocks in place in China in each of our divisions that we think will help us have very sold year.

","On our call today, you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. ","Now I'll turn the call over to David Novak.","David C. Novak","Okay, great, Tim, and thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to announce we delivered 14% earnings per share growth in 2011, marking the 10th consecutive year we exceeded our annual target of at least 10%. Before I talk about our results, I'd like to start by thanking all of you who attended our Investor and Analyst Day this past December in New York. This meeting gives us the opportunity to go public with our goals and commitments, as well as showcase our management talent from around the world. The theme of our meeting, if you recall, was on the ground floor of global growth, China and a whole lot more. We highlighted our 10-year track record, but even more importantly, the future growth prospects of our company. The facts are we have a portfolio of brands with leadership positions in China and other emerging markets with a long, long runway for growth. ","We have an asset base of over 37,000 restaurants, and we continue to make progress leveraging these assets further by building sales layers and expanding day parts. Additionally, our strong cash flow generation and disciplined approach to deploying capital allows us to invest in the future growth of our business, as well as return cash to shareholders through a meaningful and growing dividend and make significant share buybacks.","We have tremendous confidence in our business model, and we're confident the best is yet to come. Today, I'm going to highlight how some of Yum!'s unique strengths position our company for even more growth ahead. ","First, our leadership position in China and in other emerging markets. Over half of our operating profit is now generated in China and the 72 other emerging countries in which we operate throughout the world. Yum!'s strongest businesses are located where the highest growth is expected to occur in the years ahead. This is a very powerful combination. We view China as the best restaurant growth opportunity of the 21st century. Our brands further strengthened their category-leading positions with a record 656 new restaurants and extraordinary same-store sales growth of 19% this past year.","KFC now has 3,701 restaurants in over 700 cities throughout the country, and continues to expand into new cities, as well as increase its penetration levels in existing markets.","Pizza Hut Casual Dining now has 626 units and is successfully opening in lower-tier cities. Its strategy to offer tremendous variety, everyday value and refresh 25% of its menu twice per year has consistently driven sales and profit growth. It's important to note that China new unit returns are the best in our business with cash paybacks within 3 years.","The macro environment continues to work in our favor in China. Rising incomes are making our brands even more affordable for an increasing number of people. In fact, the consuming class is expected to double over the next 10 years, going from 300 million to at least 600 million people, as significant urbanization continues. With this as our tailwind, our new unit development pace will continue at a high rate and we will continue to grow same-store sales.","Our strategy in China is to have leading brands in every significant category. KFC is the clear leader in Western QSR, Pizza Hut is far and away the Western casual dining leader and we're developing Pizza Hut Home Service to capture the growing off-premise market and now have 135 home service Pizza Huts. ","We're also building East Dawning to be the premier mainstream Chinese food QSR concept. And I'm pleased to say on February 1, we acquired Little Sheep, the leading hot-pot brand in Chinese casual dining with approximately 450 system restaurants. This acquisition advances our strategy to have leading brands in every significant category. ","We are looking forward to strengthening Little Sheep's operational model and increasing its market leadership position. We're very excited about the long-term potential of this brand, and we'll make the necessary investments required to ensure its success.","As I mentioned earlier, we have China and a whole lot more. We made incredible progress in India, opening 101 new restaurants in 2011. 10 years ago, we were essentially just beginning with KFC in India. And now it's our second-leading country for new unit development. In fact, we're so excited about our prospects in India and its impact on the future growth of Yum!, that we're going to break it out as a separate division for 2012 reporting. ","Those of you who made it to our New York meeting got to hear from Niren Chaudhary, President of Yum! Restaurants India. Niren spoke about how encouraging it is to see that our new unit progress with KFC in India is very similar to what we saw in China during its first 10 years. Niren and his team identified key elements driving success in China and are adapting these strategies in India to leverage our iconic brands and build concepts with broad appeal. While we don't expect meaningful profit contributions from India this year, we are laying the foundation for this business to have a significant impact on Yum!'s profit growth in the future.","We also made stellar progress in Russia, where we're rebranding KFC Rostik's restaurants to stand-alone KFCs. And same-store sales growth in Russia is the best in our business. We know our primary competitor makes over $300 million in Russia. We're just getting started and we have plans to build a strong business in Russia as well, as we build off of our base of nearly 150 restaurants. ","We are also driving major growth in the continent of Africa, building off our 656 stores in South Africa. We entered Zambia, Ghana and Kenya in 2011, and plan to enter 7 new countries in 2012, in addition to expanding our business in South Africa. In all, we plan to have restaurants in about 20 countries by the end of this year. With over $1 billion people throughout the continent of Africa, we know we're just getting started.","As a point of reference, we have about 60 restaurants per 1 million people in the United States. We have fewer than 2 restaurants per 1 million people in the top 10 emerging markets. Clearly, Yum! Brands has a long runway for growth in emerging markets.","Now one not so well-known aspect about Yum! is the solid progress we're making in both France and Germany. Our restaurants in France have the highest average unit volumes in the world for Yum! and KFC. We continue to build our scale and increase television advertising. France is also the first market where we experimented with the business rental market to drive new unit development and returns. And we've taken this approach to Germany where we're expecting to have the necessary scale to utilize television advertising in 2013. ","We have 133 KFCs in France and 76 in Germany today. Our challenge going forward is to secure great sites as fast as our people capability allows. So while France and Germany are certainly developed countries, they are clearly emerging businesses for Yum! Brand.","Today, we make less than $50 million in France and Germany, while our primary competitor makes well over $1 billion in these 2 countries alone. Clearly, we are on the ground floor in continental Europe.","With our leadership position in emerging markets and new unit opportunities around the world, the Yum! growth story is about China and unquestionably, a whole lot more. In addition to our vast new unit development opportunities in emerging markets, we have tremendous potential with the 37,000 restaurants we currently have in our portfolio. We've been very successful in China, leveraging our assets throughout the day with breakfast, 24-hour service, delivery and innovative beverages. ","We're making progress in several other countries as well. In Yum! Restaurants International, we have nearly 4,000 restaurants with grilled ovens, which enable innovative non-fried products, and 3,700 restaurants serving our Krushers line of frozen beverages. These numbers will continue to expand further in 2012.","We understand it takes time to build these incremental sales layers and day parts, and we are committed to their success. ","We're also reinvigorating our U.S. business. We had positive net unit growth at Taco Bell and Pizza Hut in 2011, and we expect this trend to continue. As I mentioned earlier, Taco Bell just launched breakfast in 800 restaurants in the West Coast with its First Meal strategy. Taco Bell built an incredible late-night business by gradually staying open longer and longer. We're taking that same strategy and applying it to breakfast. We'll be opening for breakfast about 8:00 a.m. and gradually moving that earlier as we gain traction. ","We're also reinventing the taco by launching the Doritos Locos Taco in March, which is a taco made from the nacho cheese Doritos. These are just a couple of examples of the exciting things you'll be seeing at Taco Bell this year.","Given the importance of Taco Bell to our U.S. profitability, I'm pleased to say Taco Bell has reversed its negative sales in the fourth quarter, and Taco Bell's positive same-store sales trends continue as we speak.","We are confident Taco Bell is on its way to strong performance this year, as we ready for the launch of Doritos Locos Tacos. So once again, we're pleased the brand has regained momentum. We will comment no further on recent sales trends.","Pizza Hut delivered a solid year in 2011 on the heels of a great 2010. The combination of value, innovative new products and unique bundling has performed well. We will continue to leverage these strategies going forward. Our U.S. business is clearly in a position to improve results. We expect profit growth from our U.S. businesses this year and more consistent performance going forward.","Our success in executing these strategies has driven our return on invested capital to over 22%, which is among industry leaders, and we continue to be disciplined with our capital allocation. We generated over $2 billion of cash from operations in 2011. We're fortunate to have many high-return, global opportunities to invest in for future growth. ","We will also continue to return cash to shareholders. 2011 marked the seventh consecutive year we raised our dividend at a double-digit rate. Our dividend now has an annual rate of $1.14 per share. We also repurchased $733 million of our stock in 2011, and expect to repurchase about $800 million in 2012.","In conclusion, we're very proud of our track record of success. We will continue leveraging our strength in China and other emerging markets. We are challenging all our businesses to look for ways to further utilize our 37,000 existing assets. We expect better performance in the United States. And we continue to generate significant cash and will remain disciplined in our approach to deploying capital. ","I'm encouraged by the positive momentum we have in our business. We are well positioned to meet or exceed our annual target of at least 10% earnings per share growth in 2012 and beyond. ","So now let me turn it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer.","Richard T. Carucci","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to cover 3 topics. First, I will discuss our fourth quarter and 2011 full year results. Then I'll provide a brief update of our outlook for 2012. Finally, I will talk about the actions we took in 2011 and plan to take in 2012 to reinforce our high-growth, high-return business model.","First, let's talk about the fourth quarter. Let me remind you that our U.S. business and a portion of Yum! Restaurants International benefited from an extra week in the fourth quarter of 2011. This had a material positive impact on our fourth quarter results. We also incurred higher spending throughout the year in franchise development incentives and higher-than-normal restaurant closures. Therefore, the combined impact of the 53rd week offset by this higher spending only had a modest positive impact for the full year of 2011.","During the fourth quarter, operating profit grew 14% prior to the foreign exchange benefit. In the U.S., the 53rd week had an $18 million benefit to operating profit. Without the benefit of the 53rd week, U.S. operating profit would've been flat versus prior year. For Yum! Restaurants International, the 53rd week had an $8 million benefit to operating profit.","For Yum! overall in the fourth quarter, operating profit grew 8%, excluding the benefits of both the 53rd week and foreign currency exchange.","Sales improved in the fourth quarter through much of Yum!. China same-store sales growth increased by over 20% in the quarter, when we added 327 restaurants. At YRI, after seeing same-store sales growth of 2% in the first and second quarters, we had 3% sales growth in the third and fourth quarters. ","The fourth quarter also represented the highest quarter of same-store sales results for our U.S. business. All 3 U.S. brands had higher same-store sales in the fourth quarter than they did in the third quarter. We are glad to end the year with a sales uptick and with some momentum to carry us into 2012.","Now let me provide a brief overview of our full year results in 2011. Our China business simply had an exceptional year. Record development of 656 new units, combined with 19% same-store sales growth on a business of our scale is quite an accomplishment. While our China business has produced some stellar years, I personally believe 2011 was our finest sales year ever. With that said, we simply cannot expect 19% same-store sales growth going forward. And fortunately, our business model does not rely on this heroic performance, as new unit development, combined with more moderate same-store sales growth, can still drive strong system sales growth and strong profit growth.","We ended 2011 with full year restaurant margins of 19.7%. This was in line with our recent expectations. During our third quarter earnings call, we stated that we expected restaurant margins to decline in the fourth quarter due to high inflation, but for full year margins to be about 20%. We expect to make progress closing the gap between inflation and our menu pricing, and to see positive year-over-year restaurant margins in the second half of 2012.","I have one final comment to put our China results in perspective. As we look back to our 2011 year, please note that these results were on top of a very strong performance in 2010. In fact, in U.S. dollar terms, China earned about $600 million in 2009. By 2011, China operating profit exceeded $900 million. This represents a 50% increase in profit over just a 2-year period.","Yum! Restaurants International had a solid year, opening 905 new units including 101 units in India. As David mentioned, our international team did a great job of making progress in our high-growth countries. To help reinforce this point, please note that 622 of our new units were in emerging markets and over 90% were opened by our franchisees.","In the U.S., results were disappointing in 2011 with full year profits down 12%. We had a solid year at Pizza Hut, but weak sales and profit results at Taco Bell and KFC. As we said in New York, given our product news and cost management, we believe we are well positioned to have sales and profit growth in the U.S. in 2012.","Before I end my comments on 2011, let me provide some context for Yum!'s results. In his remarks, David mentioned that our decade-long track record of EPS growth has been strong. We're proud to be a very select group of companies that have produced such consistent growth over this time frame. Yum! posted 2011 earnings per share of $2.87 before special items. On a similar basis, our EPS is over 3.5x what it was 10 years ago.","During the same decade, our ROIC has increased 4 percentage points to over 22% in 2011. We look forward to building upon this track record as a high-growth and high-return business for many years to come.","Now let's look ahead to 2012. At our Annual Investor and Analyst Conference in New York in December, we laid out detailed plans for our growth expectations in 2012. So I won't repeat what we stated there. If you did miss our investor conference, the presentations are still available on our website. ","However, there are 2 significant areas that I do want to address today as it relates to 2012. First, international new unit development remains a key driver of our growth. We expect to again add 1,500 new units outside the U.S. in 2012, at least 600 new units in China, about 800 new units in Yum! Restaurants International and 100 new units in Yum! Restaurants India. The 2011 and 2012 new units are key drivers of our EPS growth.","Second, I want to comment on China sales. For the first quarter of 2012, given the strong sales over the Chinese New Year, and keeping in mind that our first quarter consists of only January and February, we expect solid double-digit same-store sales growth. As the year progresses and the overlaps become more challenging, we do expect same-store sales to moderate. Of course, it is difficult for us to predict in what quarter this will happen. We do expect the combination of strong same-store sales and new unit development to produce healthy operating profit growth in 2012 in China.","Our overall outlook for Yum! has not changed significantly from the December meeting. We are confident that 2012 will be another year of double-digit EPS growth for Yum! Brands.","Finally, I want to spend a minute talking about our evolving and enduring business model. As I have said before, our philosophy is really pretty simple. We reduce company ownership in highly penetrated or underperforming markets and we increase exposure in emerging and under-penetrated markets. By following this philosophy, and due to strong execution by our division teams, our business model has evolved over the years. Today, over 70% of our operating profit is generated by our international businesses. We ended 2011 with over $1.5 billion in operating profit in China and YRI. 10 years ago, we made only about $350 million in these businesses combined, which represented 30% of our profits at that time. The vast majority of this growth has been in emerging markets. We took actions in 2011 and plan to take more actions in 2012 that are consistent with our principles and that will prove our ability to further grow emerging markets.","We continue to reduce our footprint in highly penetrated markets. In December of 2011, we completed the sale of Long John Silver's and A&W All-American Restaurants. The larger of these concepts, Long John Silver's, has about 97% of their restaurants in the U.S. Second, we continue our U.S. refranchising program. Our plan is to retain about 5% ownership in KFC and Pizza Hut. We are currently at 8% ownership with Pizza Hut and plan to be at 5% ownership for KFC by the end of 2012. We announced at our investor conference our plan to reduce Taco Bell U.S. ownership from 23% to about 16% over the next 2 years.","Finally, we announced our decision in the third quarter of 2011 to refranchise our entire Pizza Hut U.K. business. We have started the sales process, and our intention is to sell this business this year.","At the same time, we are aggressively growing our presence in emerging and underpenetrated markets. While our franchise partners fuel the majority of our new unit growth, we will also build company units in international markets where we can achieve scale, realize high growth and yield high returns. We've made 3 acquisitions in recent times that meet this criteria. First, in 2010, we exercised our option to take full management control of Rostik's KFC in Russia. As David mentioned, during 2011, our first full year of operations, results have been impressive as Russia had one of the highest same-store sales growth rates in all of YRI. We've made significant progress at rebranding this business as a KFC brand. This has increased our confidence that Russia will become a big business for Yum!.","Secondly, we bought out our largest KFC franchisee in South Africa in the fourth quarter of 2011. This acquisition allows us to establish an equity base in South Africa and to fuel the high-growth potential for the rest of Africa. ","And finally, just last week we completed the acquisition of Little Sheep in China. We're very excited to bring our operating and development expertise to this business. Our China team is executing the transition of Yum!'s ownership of this brand as we speak.","The Little Sheep business will add about 5% to our revenue base in China for 2012. With the timing of the acquisition, there will be no public filings for full year 2011 results. The last public filing was for the first 6 months of 2011.","We are reviewing the full year financial information now. But we can tell you for the year 2011, revenues grew by about 10% as a result of new unit expansion. Net income was down for the year, continuing the trend in the first 6 months. Same-store sales were negative in the back half of 2011. Besides sales deleveraging, margins were also negatively impacted by significant commodity and labor inflation. We will share more information with you regarding the expected profit impact of this acquisition for Yum! in 2012 at a later date. However, when you take into account transaction and transition costs, we expect only a modest profit impact in 2012.","In conclusion, I am very confident in the strength of our business model. We believe that the investment decisions we are making today will set us up for success now and for the long term. We will continue to invest in underpenetrated markets with a long run rate for growth, deploy capital in our existing asset base that generates high returns and leverage these assets with additional sales layers and day parts to generate same-store sales growth.","In our New York meeting, I pointed out that our business is evolving and enduring. In fact, I showed that we expect a robust EPS model in the year 2020. We intend to do the things we need to do to grow the business each year and to continue to lay the groundwork for our growth in the future. I am confident that we have a strong business in 2012, 2020 and beyond.","Back to you, David.","David C. Novak","Thank very much, Rick. What we'd like to do now is open it up for any questions that you have about the business.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","My question is really about the pace of unit openings in China.  That business is showing a lot of top line momentum and great returns on capital. And you exceeded at least the low end of your guidance fairly significantly in terms of unit openings for 2011. So the question is what are your thoughts on being able to sustain that higher level of openings and potentially even move it higher as you look into 2012 and beyond?","Richard T. Carucci","As you mentioned, the Chinese team has just had an amazing track record for getting unit growth and also getting this growth through all tier cities. We continue to expand aggressively in Tier 3 through 6 cities and especially expanding our lead in those areas. So we feel very good about what's occurred. As a reminder of what we said in New York, David, was that we ended up increasing the new unit growth because of a couple of factors. One had been the even faster infrastructure growth that the China government has taken on, and Lily took us through that they're building these city clusters. And what that's doing is allowing new trade zones in places like train stations, bus stations, et cetera, but it's also developing new trade zones, as they're building new apartments in some of these cities as well, so that's led that growth. And the other piece that has increased our numbers in 2011, where it was really Pizza Hut development. And Pizza Hut -- a while back, we struggled in Tier 3 cities, our second unit in Tier 3 cities. We're having really good success in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities now with Pizza Hut as we have more variety and better value in those restaurants. So I don't expect any of that to change in the next year or so. So we still have our guidance of at least 600 units, and I think it's safe to say we'll hit that 600 unit. Regarding further out, it's always been hard to predict when the next layer of unit growth has occurred. We were stuck on only 500 for about a 4-year period before we got to the 600. So I've still said historically that I expect the absolute number to grow over time, while the percentage continued to decline, and that's still my personal best guess at this point in time.","David C. Novak","I agree with everything that Rick just said, and just let me give you just a little bit more color about why we're very bullish about the development opportunities in China. I think the biggest tailwind, as I mentioned earlier, is just the growing consumer class, going from 300 million to 600 million people in the next 10 years or at least that. But then I think our whole formula for success in China has been geared on great local management team with phenomenal local operating capability. And we've always had one rule, we never want to expand any further than or faster than our people capability. Because we've got these brands that are so good, we just want to keep polishing the diamond. Now having said that, when you look at our operating capabilities, the best we have in the world, 90% of our restaurant managers in China have at least a college education. When I talk to Mark Chu, the President of China, he'll tell you that in every one of our KFC's, we have 2 new assistants ready to open up new stores when we're ready. So we have the people capability, and we know there are lots of people there that need jobs, want jobs, and we're creating all kinds of jobs there, so we have a tremendous environment that's set up for operating capability. In fact, our operating capability is so good there, we really see ourself as the training ground for retail development and retail managers in China. We have what we call the Whampoa Academy, where we're really developing talent to not only grow our business but we think will help other retailers as that country emerges by providing talent, which is fine. We basically tell somebody when they come out in school, in 4 years they can run a restaurant at KFC, or if they want to go  start their own business, they'll be ready, or they can go work for another retailer, or they can become a franchisee. But we're like the Procter and Gambles, the king of marketing talent in the United States. We see ourselves as the leader in operating talent in China. The second big thing on people capability is just our development operations. Our development team -- we have 700 people in our development team. And we have the best retail management base in China. This is a huge competitive advantage as we go forward. And what I always say is that when you go into any of these new cities, we're going to have the flagship location and\/or locations before our primary competitor even gets there. So we're going to -- so we have a huge competitive advantage there. So I think underpinning everything that we're doing in China is the operating capability we have. And I think it really is true, the formula of success in this business, you have the people capably right, you get that right and then you satisfy more customers, then you make more money. We're basically delivering that in spades. The only other thing I would say is what we're talking about now, in terms of our development engine is KFC, leader in QSR, Pizza Hut, leader in casual dining. We're obviously developing Pizza Hut Home Service. We're obviously developing East Dawning for Chinese quick-service opportunities as we go forward and we just bought Little Sheep because we want to have the leading brands in every significant category. So our goal, obviously, is to keep this development engine primed and pumped and take advantage of the significant opportunity we have to provide great brands in China, create lots of jobs in China, and make our business even bigger.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A few just quick questions here. Could you describe or maybe give some numbers around how much of that company margin decline in the quarter in China was due to the higher new opens that were year-over-year in that quarter? My suspicion is that there's some sort of preopening friction costs in there. And then secondly, reimaging for Taco Bell in the U.S., can you give us an update there and refranchising for KFC in the U.S.?","Richard T. Carucci","Regarding the margins in China, by far, the biggest impact that we had, which we expected coming into it, was food inflation and labor inflation. There is an impact, to your point, on new openings as they went up versus prior year.  We always have a lot of new openings in the fourth quarter. We think the impact to that is a bit over one point. Regarding KFC refranchising, I feel very good with the progress we've made. As I mentioned, in early 2011, we had spent some time working on a fairly large transaction that after we sort of turned our attention to smaller deals, we think we've made a lot of progress. So feel good with how we ended the year. I believe we are very well poised to therefore deliver on what we've set as finishing the KFC refranchising in 2012. And I think the final numbers, which is in our release, for the refranchising of KFC was 160 units in the fourth quarter.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And reimaging for Taco Bell, where are you on that, and what's the plan there?","David C. Novak","Taco Bell, we think that the units are in pretty good shape, so we like the way we look in the U.S. We're continuing to upgrade our system. We think about 50% of our system is where it should be today, so we have work to do. But it's sort of normal pacing and sequencing. I think one thing that's always helps is we believe we're well positioned to have a strong 2012. So whenever franchisees are doing better, they're usually in a better position to invest in continuing to upgrade their asset.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about a couple of things on China. First of all, with the new development step-up, can you maybe talk about quantitatively what you're seeing with the latest batch versus prior years? And then secondly, on labor inflation over there, do you guys feel like at this point, you need to take any proactive steps to address it, since as you said, you think comps are probably going to moderate and I'm not quite sure what happens to profitability if labor inflation stays at this rate but you don't comp at the rate that you're currently comping? And then lastly, in China, if I got it right, I think you said Little Sheep same-store sales are currently negative. I'm curious to hear why you think that is and what kind of a turnaround might be required for that brand?","Richard T. Carucci","Michael, remind me the first question. Labor was the second question, what was the first question?","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","What you're seeing in the latest batch of Chinese openings versus prior years.","David C. Novak","Yes, still early on the China in terms of -- we've seen nothing different really, in terms of our performance for China new units. We haven't seen the fourth quarter ones yet, but the stuff that we had throughout 2011 were very similar to what we've had before, very high hit rates, very high return on invested capital. And the trend that has continued a bit is stronger performance in Tier 2 through 6 cities than in Tier 1 cities. So again, we're being more cautious in our Tier 1 cities, which we've been doing throughout 2011. But we feel very good about the performance of new units. The labor side to me is a bit gravity [ph]. We expect labor rates to continue to go up. As we've said before, that's a dual-edged sword. We'll obviously do the things we can do to make -- to have productivity in our restaurants. But my belief is that if labor inflation occurs at a high rate, we'll have to price to offset it as will everybody else. So I think that's how that will play out. Little Sheep, we really are just starting to understand the business. So we have teams that are going there now. The deal just closed at February 1, so the team is going through transition right now.  We're welcoming the people who were part of Little Sheep into the Yum! family. We think they have high enthusiasm, high talent, so we're pleased to be working with them. But we really don't have a lot of insight into the performance last year. I pretty much shared what we know. And we're still trying to really learn more about the details of that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Siegner with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So as the refranchising program in the U.S. continues along this path and you become closer and closer to being kind of this super highly franchised, very stable business, one thing I think that's been interesting is how you're franchise and license expense in the domestic business has actually moved substantially higher, not just in dollar terms, but also as a percent of franchise and license revenues. And I think in 2011, there was clearly some incentives as you talked about, maybe for Pizza Hut Delco. How should we think about that franchise and license expense either in dollars or percents going forward as you finish this transition with KFC and get closer with Taco Bell? Like where does that franchise and license expense end up when that program's done?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, I think it'll be fairly close to what it is today, with the exception of, as we pointed out, the incentive this year -- sorry, in 2011, on the Pizza Hut Delco. So and again, what we were doing there is providing incentive for lower-cost Pizza Hut delivery units especially geared towards smaller towns. And it's a less expensive unit and that's actually -- had the desired effect. A lot of franchisees have built them. We ended up with net positive units in Pizza Hut for the first time in quite a while in 2011. We see that number increasing as we go to 2012. But the way that the incentive worked, we actually started -- was a 2011 -- sorry, 2010 and 2011 incentive, but a lot of the spending ended up in 2011. So that amount of money, I'd say it's probably about $4 million higher than what it normally should be. If you adjust for that, my guess is the percentages will be pretty constant going forward.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And at this point, there's no plan or talk of an incentive to encourage remodels or reimaging across the franchise system, is that right?","David C. Novak","We have various programs in place, but nothing major new at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions as well. Can you talk about just the dynamics of pricing, check and margins in China? It looks like the check was up 1%. But pricing year-over-year by the end of the quarter looked it was, I think, up 7% based on what we track.  Just kind of curious how that played out and how it looks in 2012. And then just a question on Taco Bell.   Just wanted to get a clarification. David, I think you said Taco Bell was positive in the fourth quarter. The release had it down 2%, and I think you said it was positive here in the early part of 2012. So maybe you could just bring us up to date on that and maybe also address this salmonella issue if that's had any effect on sales.","Richard T. Carucci","Okay. Why not David go first with Taco Bell.","David C. Novak","Well, first of all, our sales in Taco Bell turned positive late in the fourth quarter, and they continue to be positive even in the most recent days. And so, as I mentioned, the event that you just talked about had no impact on our sales or transactions. And the event I want to point out took place last year. And if you would like any more information about that, just go to our website at the tacobell.com. But I think bottom line is, is that when we look at Taco Bell, we are extremely pleased that Taco Bell sales turned positive late in the fourth quarter, positive now. And we are readying for our Taco Nacho Cheese Tacos launch, which we think is the biggest innovation in the Mexican quick service restaurant industry in I don't know how long.  But I mean, this is like we really took advantage of the fact that we have a great partnership with PepsiCo, went to Frito Lay, have the opportunity to launch Doritos Taco shells, which totally proprietary. No one else in the industry will be doing it. Very excited about that launch, which is coming up. We also have launched breakfast, I think, in a very smart way that we can make money. We just opened it up in 800 restaurants in the West Coast, starting it at 8:00, takes care a lot of the labor issues, and we think that we'll ultimately end up expanding that across the country, and having breakfast earlier, just like we expanded our late-night. The other thing that we're very excited about, which we now have in test, is a line of higher-quality category breakthrough value with a celebrity chef, Lorena Garcia, where we have new ingredients, new pico sauce, new meat, bowls.  We think we are bringing Taco Bell value to a different line of products that are more premium, where we'll really just re-establish the category value, which we think is terrific. So there's lots of really good things going on at Taco Bell. The franchisees are extremely excited about it, and we're very bullish that we're going to be able to have a outstanding year or at least a solid year this year. You pick your adjective, but it's going to be a lot better than last year. Okay, so we're enthusiastic. And longer term, as I've always said, we think Taco Bell is a huge opportunity for Yum! Brands. We're underpenetrated. We think if we can get a couple hundred thousand dollars more of sales volume, we can go from a little over 5,000 restaurants to 8,000 restaurants in the United States because we are the national competitor, so we really have a very dominant position. And as we -- we also look at Taco Bell as a global opportunity, an opportunity to begin to expand that around the world as well. So we're very bullish on Taco Bell, and upward and onward.","Richard T. Carucci","Joe, regarding your first question about China dynamics on pricing and margins, you pretty much have the pricing right. We had -- if you go back in 2011, we had a 3% pricing roughly in the first quarter. We had 2% pricing at the end of September, and we had 2% pricing in early November. So if you look at the impact in the fourth quarter, we basically had 3 months, because if you look at the September, it's right at the end of that month, so again, remind folks that the fourth quarter is a 4-month quarter for China, September, October, November, and December. So we had 3 months of the first price increase, and [indiscernible] of 2%, then we took another price increase early in November, also about 2%, and we got about 2 months of that. So we have little, about 5 months of pricing increase over a 4-month period. So the net effect of that was a little over 2 points of effective pricing that showed up in the fourth quarter this year. On the flip side of that, we had very high food inflation and labor inflation, as we sort of highlighted on the quarter 3 call, we ended up with 11% food inflation, about 18% labor inflation. So the impact on margins of that was about a negative 7%. And the overall impact we had on pricing was a positive 5%, that 2% I talked about in the fourth quarter plus the benefit of 3% in the first quarter. So that's really what the big factors were in the margin decline. As you look forward to what we expect in the first quarter, just a couple of things to keep in mind. One is that some of that pricing rolls off because we took the 3% pricing during the first quarter last year. We still expect high food commodity in the first quarter of next year, although our indications are that commodity inflation will get better as the year develops in China. And we'll have a little bit of higher benefit from the pricing we just took in the fourth quarter.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And Rick, when do you lap the value initiatives? Like when should that mix impact become a little less significant in China?","Richard T. Carucci","I'd say by the second quarter. We started -- we have different value pieces. So just to put that in perspective, our -- what we call our value mix. And again, we have it in all the day parts, it's breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea are the 3 areas where we sort of have some value combinations. If you add that up, Joe, it's about 10% to 15% of our mix, so they're in those value layer that we have, which is about what we wanted. But a lot of that came in the first quarter but some of it came in more aggressively in the second quarter. So again, that's the reason why first quarter, I don't expect heroic margin results. But I expect margins to get better as we get into the second quarter and beyond. And what we've said before is we expect margins to be better on a year-over-year basis by the second half of 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, just a follow-up on that question and your comments on China this quarter. Have you actually begun to lap the value initiatives from -- I think you started with breakfast and then went to lunch. Have you actually seen the year-on-year laps? And are you still confident in getting the traffic lift?  Or is the first quarter sort of half you didn't get the laps and so it was positive and as you lap it, you're seeing more moderate traffic growth?","Richard T. Carucci","You'll see more in the second quarter. We lapped some in the first quarter as we eventually did some, but you have to be careful because Chinese New Year is such a big event in China. It's hard to get a real lead on that, so we'll probably know more when we get into the second quarter.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the U.S. margin, one specific question, more a broad question. Specifically, you've got some nice occupancy leverage.  And I don't think you got that in prior quarters, and I know comps got a little bit better, but it wasn't a massive inflection, so I don't know if that's a function of refranchising or some other element.  That's the specific. And more broadly, Rick, as you hit your goals and say 13% of the refranchising of the brands, what would that do to impact U.S. margins? In other words, you'd reported a 12.3% I think in '11.  If you were to refranchise all those stores today, how much better do you think margins would be?","Richard T. Carucci","Unfortunately, I think I have to get back to you on both of those questions, John. The refranchising impact we have is going to be somewhat significant, not as significant as some of the previous years, but we'll benefit in particular from the refranchising we did in 2011 on KFC. The Taco Bell we'll benefit less from because their margins aren't that far away from our overall margin level. So I would think it would be about at least 0.5 point but we'd have to get back to you with more specific numbers on that.","David C. Novak","And john, on the lower occupancy, that would -- that's -- part of that would definitely be some of the benefit of refranchising. So those will generally be lower margin stores, lower volume stores, so occupancy would be higher as a percentage.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 questions. First, a follow-up on the earlier questions on China, and related to pricing. Thank you for the sequential trends in terms of how much pricing you took last year. I'm just wondering, as you look further out into '12, I think you told us at the Analyst Day, you needed like 4-plus points to protect the margin, which I think you kind of said you hope to sustain that 20% in '12. I'm just wondering if you can update us on as you lap that, I guess it was 3% from the first quarter of '11. Is the current plan to take more pricing and therefore kind of still be running that 5% level?  And is 6% food cost inflation still the best guess? I'm just trying to gauge the confidence of the importance of the 20%-plus margin in '12 and that sequential trend. And then I had a follow-up on the U.S. business.","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, I mean, right now, obviously, what we do with pricing will depend on what happens with inflation. And I'd say, right now, we're not changing our view of commodity inflation in China. We probably have a higher degree of confidence that it will moderate. I mean, we have it moderating in our forecast. I think our confidence of that has come up a little bit as we sort of just see what's happening in the marketplace there. So given that, what we've sort of said is we expect to take obviously some pricing in 2012. Our best guess is sometime in the second quarter, but that'll depend on how things play out a little bit. We have nothing planned specifically at this time, but that's our best guess, and the level of it will depend on if we see anything different on the commodity side.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that -- with the goal being to get it back up to roughly -- or sustain that 20% level is kind of the longer-term target for '12?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes. And again, I probably -- the way the math works is we think it'll be right around 20% for 2012. But I think the bigger importance from my standpoint is to make sure by the second half of 2012, we're at normal levels of margins. And I think that, to us, is also the 20% on an annual basis. So yes, I feel pretty good about our ability to do that by the back half of the year. And right about now, we're not changing what we sort of said in New York, where were we sort of said our best guess for full year 2012 margins is about 20%.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. And then just on the U.S. side, the G&A savings from refranchising, can you just -- if you were to kind of extract that, kind of how much that is and when you'd expect that through the year? I mean, how would you -- I know you're talking about return to profit growth in '12 in the U.S., but I'm just wondering about the sequential build on that. So how much is the savings? And how you would expect that to flow through the year in terms of U.S. profit growth?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, there's sort of 3 big things happening in the U.S. in 2012 on a G&A perspective, so it may be hard to be watching from the sidelines. One is we've actually made some changes.  As we restructure our business, it'll generate G&A savings. That number is about $30 million, so it's like 3 $30 million numbers to keep in mind. That'll benefit us in 2012, right? So we'll get benefit from that, roughly that amount. Another $30 million, unfortunately going the wrong way as our pension costs are expected to arise.  Most of that, and that'll happen at the Yum! in U.S. level -- most of that's at the U.S. level. So as we lowered our discount rate for the year, that's having a $30 million negative impact to our pension expense, which will hit G&A, mostly G&A.   Some of it hits margin, but most of it's G&A. And then the third about $30 million per year is the actual -- the first $30 million of restructuring really occurs at all levels of the organization. As you actually refranchise units, you'll also get G&A savings from having fewer area coaches and those types of things. That will also develop during the course of the year. That last piece to keep in mind, though, is offset by lower revenues and profits that you get from a refranchised restaurant versus a company-owned restaurants. So we sort of said that last $30 million will be neutral. So it's -- so when you add that up, we probably expect G&A roughly to come down $30 million and for that to be offset by lower profits of company-owned stores. So when you throw it all in, it'll -- it should be negative to -- I'm sorry, flat to profitability but about $30 million favorable for G&A. Does that make sense?","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I think just to clarify, it's $30 million positive from the first point; it's $30 million negative from the pension, which I would think would roughly offset each other; and then the third one is the savings from the fewer area but it sounded like there was -- that was going to be net neutral. So it sounded like the G&A in total would really not change in either direction.","Richard T. Carucci","The last piece of it will be neutral for profitability but favorable for G&A.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one quick one and then a longer-term question on YRI. But on China, did you guys make any adjustments to the value program in the fourth quarter that sort of caused some of the improvement in the mix trends there? And then, just secondly, on YRI, I guess going back to the same question on unit growth in China, are you getting to a point where you'd feel comfortable raising the gross new unit openings at YRI, or do you feel like you're going to be at this level we've been in the last few years for a while?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, on the YRI piece of it, we're pretty pleased with what we have. We've covered a lot of that, I think, at the Analyst Meeting in the sense of we are building -- we've been getting close to critical mass in certain countries, France, Germany, Russia, it's a little early for Africa yet, where we think we could start to accelerate development, but we're not ready to make that call for 2012. So I do think that there's a good chance over time that number goes up in total, but right now, we're just sort of calling it similar to where we were.","David C. Novak","The other thing, Jason, on YRI unit growth, it was 4% net for the year, which is definitely on the high -- if you look at trends for YRI, that was on the good side of the trend, so we feel very good about that as well.","Richard T. Carucci","On the value question is, is part of the November price increase that we talked about included lowering cost of sales in some of our value initiatives in China. And that was pretty much in all the areas, in breakfast, work day, lunch and afternoon tea. So we tweaked our value offerings everywhere there. There were, I'd say, minor adjustments but included in that 2% number I gave you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.","Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And regarding China, when we think about the 20% margin on a longer-term basis, the food and paper line's about 35% of company sales. In the U.S., it's about 30%. Now commodities are rising, but do you think that there are structural improvements in sourcing and distribution and perhaps other areas that could take that food and beverage number, that percent down over time to where the U.S. level is?","David C. Novak","Yes, I think that was probably true a while ago. So one of the things that occurred until, I'd say, the last couple of years is we were able really to not take any pricing and really get a lot of efficiencies on our cost of goods, just through buying for thousands of units versus buying for hundreds of units. It's realistically probably less. I think there's some upside but not -- going forward, but not as big as it has been historically. And the higher food cost in China, I think were done intentionally, in that we wanted to make sure we provided a lot of value, and we could afford to do that because our labor costs were lower. So we've always had good value in China. Obviously, if labor costs creep up, we'll have to figure out how to deal with that. And some of that may be by reducing our food costs, but obviously, we look at all parts of the P&L and pricing to manage that.","Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And separately, on Pizza Hut, a great quarter off of a pretty tough comparison. Can you give us a sense, do you think it was more company-specific initiatives? Is the category reaccelerating? Any thoughts on the Pizza Hut comps from that -- or further thoughts would be great.","Richard T. Carucci","Mitch, are you talking about U.S.?","Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes, in the U.S. I'm sorry.","David C. Novak","I think Pizza Hut is just building on its foundation of value that was established with the launch of our $10 any program, and we continue to bring the $10 message forward.  Plus we had the combination of the low end, the $10 large pizza any way you want it combined with the $20 box meal that we came up with, which was an innovation in terms of bundling. So I think as we look at Pizza Hut this year, we think we've got -- we're going to have -- you will see the combination of more value and the constancy of that value and the creativity around how we bring our value message to the marketplace, plus you'll see continued innovation, you will see the typical innovation that we're pretty famous for in the category in terms of pizzas. We also, Mitch, continue to drive our Pasta business on Tuesdays and our Wings business on Wednesday, leveraging the asset throughout the day. So I think the great thing about Pizza Hut right now is we feel like we have a very solid foundation from -- to build on. In years past, we were so dependent on just the marketing whizbang pizza of the year. And I think with our everyday value proposition being what it is now, we have a much more stable proposition to build on as we go forward. The other thing that we're very excited about is that we are working very hard on the operating side. We think there's significant opportunity to improve sales just through getting our pizzas to our customers faster, drive more productivity inside the store in terms of speed. So we think we have a lot of initiatives that will give us confidence that Pizza Hut's going to keep moving forward. I think the big chains are doing better now overall, because we've all improved our value proposition. And certainly, we've led the way with that at Pizza Hut.","Operator","Your next question comes from Yang Huang with Sanford Bernstein.","Yang Huang","This is Yang in for Sara Senatore. My question is can you talk about the food and labor inflation cadence through 2012, in the U.S. and YRI, and what's the likelihood and timing of pricing in those regions?","David C. Novak","Yes, it's really hard to generalize on YRI and -- but in general, I'd say the same thing that we sort of see in China is that we -- similar in the U.S., we would probably expect more commodity inflation in the first half of the year and less commodity inflation in the last half of the year. Labor, I don't think there's any significant difference in expectations on timing during the course of 2012.","Yang Huang","Okay. And how about the pricing expectation?","David C. Novak","Again, I think similar to China, in the way that we'll probably take some modest pricing early in the year and then sort of reassess depending on what commodities do later in the years.","Yang Huang","Okay. That's for both the U.S. and YRI?","David C. Novak","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.","Andrew M. Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Sorry if I missed it early. Just on the overall, your best guess on the overall U.S. inflation number for the year? And then are there any cost impact of the Taco Bell upgrades that David was referring to?","Richard T. Carucci","First of all, Andy, the upgrades have been pretty much consistent through the past probably 3 years. So no, in terms of company side P&L, there wouldn't really be anything incremental to that.","David C. Novak","On the commodity side, our numbers we had outlined previously were about 6%.","Richard T. Carucci","It's 6% for China.","David C. Novak","Right. And about 2% for the U.S. and 5% for YRI.","Richard T. Carucci","Those numbers are basically the same as we -- for everyone. Those were the same numbers that we laid out for everyone in the New York meeting. So we haven't changed any of our expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from Larry Miller with RBC.","Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had 2 questions. One on Taco Bell breakfast. What kind of mix are you expecting? Can you give us that in either percentage terms or dollar terms? And then secondly, on Little Sheep, I understand it's a new business, but you probably have seen the economics.  Can you talk about the economics? And then, can you give us a sense of how the China team is prepared to handle not only fast growth but managing 5 brands. Is that too much? Or are they very prepared for this?","Richard T. Carucci","On the Little Sheep, I really -- I'll remind a couple of things that I said.  Don't have a lot more to say, because again, we're busy both transitioning people in and quite frankly, figuring out exactly what we're going to do in several of the areas of the business. So really, as we mentioned, we know that 2011 didn't end on a strong point, but we really haven't done the diagnostics of what we're going to do to address that. But again, we feel very good about the category and the brand. Remind people, although hotsy [ph] are not well-known here, it's a $5 billion category in China. They're the leaders in that category, and we believe that the expertise that we bring plus the experience and the brand that they have will be a good long-term partnership.","David C. Novak","I think in terms of China's -- well, obviously people capability is what drives us in China, and we obviously believe we have the management depth and capability to bring on that brand or we wouldn't have acquired it.","Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then on Taco Bell, on the breakfast, what are you guys expecting? Or what should we think about?","Richard T. Carucci","We really -- we've just started, so we feel good about what's happened so far but we haven't seen hard data on it now. The biggest thing to me is our -- to me, the leading indicator is going to be do franchisees who don't have it want it, based on how the franchisees who do have it. And I think it's too early to make that call. But that's obviously something we're going to keep in touch with during the course of the year. And a reminder, one of the reasons we went with this strategy is it's a lot more affordable for us and our franchisees from a labor standpoint. So to me, unless -- what we want to make sure of is that the -- that we're able to coming close to cover our costs by opening that hour or 2 earlier, and we think we have a very good chance to do it, which is why so many people signed up for it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Elliott with Raymond James.","Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'd like to go back to the China inflation, labor in particular, and just get a little more color on maybe thinking about the tiers of the employee base. Are we seeing, for example, higher inflation at the entry level or at the college-educated manager level? Or can you just peel that back a little bit?","Richard T. Carucci","I'd say it's pretty high across the board. I mean, labor inflation in China has been going on, really double-digit for a long period of time, but really ramped up about 2 years ago and especially the second half of 2010 and throughout 2011. So that's when we went and instead of seeing low double-digits, we were seeing high teens, even at 20% in the third quarter for us, for labor inflation in 2011. And it's pretty much across the board because the inflation, a lot of it's driven by increases in minimum wage. And the minimum wage increases have been in the mid teens recently, at the high teens, and so that's going to drive not just the lower group but pretty much everybody above them as well. And as we sort of said before, it's a dual sword for us because as people have more money on the positive side, they spend more and are able to afford our restaurants, but it gives us the cost to deal with. Our sense is that we may have more -- better labor inflation in 2012 than 2011. We sort of outlined that in our investor meeting. I think so far, what we've seen is consistent with that expectations. You've seen fewer markets increase their minimum wage at this -- versus at this point last year. So we're hoping to get back to mid-teen labor inflation in 2012.","Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","How about turnover trends? Has there been anything changing on that?","Richard T. Carucci","No. As David mentioned in his speech, one of the things that's been really a -- for me, a pleasant surprise is that we've been able to increase our number of college graduates, both college students and teen level. And as David mentioned now, over 90% of our restaurant general managers are college graduates. And five years ago, that number was  in I think about the 60% range. So we've been able to increase our quality at the same time we're adding restaurants. And I think part of that I think is unique to Yum!. I think people know that they're joining a company that's been very successful, and they've seen a track record of people who started at team members or restaurant general managers growing to senior management positions within company. So I think we probably have a better shot at that than some of the other players.","Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Real quick on the U.S., any wage or turnover inflation of note yet?","Richard T. Carucci","No.","Operator","We have time for one last question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe a little bit differently than some of the questions on China. As we look at the capital needs of the business, whether it's debt to EBITDA or debt to free cash flow, I was just hoping, that you could kind of comment on what you think the future direction of the balance sheet is. And whether it makes sense to take advantage of some very low interest rates even with your stock price where it is now, so that's I guess the first point. In other words, kind of above and beyond what you're generating in normal free cash flow and buyback. And then secondly, if I may, there's -- I mean, actions speak louder than words and the company has kind of generally made more developed markets, when I say developed, I mean, not for Yum!, but developed in general, franchise markets over time. And yet the company is investing capital in markets like France and Germany that are very developed and former [ph]  Leading out markets and are competitive in some cases, especially against McDonald's. And I guess the point of that question is, and related to the capital needs question is, are you currently seeding markets with company dollars, with helping finance franchisees? In other words, is that more of a kind of a, hey, let's get the market started and then over time make it a capital-light market? Or do you think that those markets become -- if you're going to stay, will become increasingly or stay high capital-need markets in the future?","Richard T. Carucci","Well, regarding, John, the first part of the question, one of the great things we've had in China is we still are -- we've been positive cash flow for at least 5 years there, even though we've continued to ramp up development there. In terms of capital as a percentage of revenues or cash flow, I think it's -- expect that to go up slightly. And the reason for that is that as we build all these units, we have to remodel them at that point. So I expect our new unit capital obviously moves with our growth. So at a certain area, that'll come down because we've sort of said that we expect new units as a percentage of the base to go down over time. But we expect the remodels to go up because capital-light market -- right now, if you go back 5 years, we were remodeling stuff that was 5 years old. So that was like 450 units at that point. Five years from now, we're going to be remodeling 656 units. So when you net those 2 out, I'd expect a slight increase in the percentages. In terms of what we'll do with our cash, we gave you a sort of our best guess at this point, still about $800 million of share buybacks. We feel very good with what we've done in the last couple of years on the debt side, John. Otherwise, we would be probably more aggressive to your point now. But we already sort of borrowed at very low rates in the last 2 years and feel very good about those rates. And at this point, we're probably looking at keeping our debt as a percentage of EBITDA constant. So as we could grow that, we'll increase debt. But like you say, we'll always keep looking at that because the rates are very strong. But no change is expected there. On France and Germany, we will have fewer company-owned restaurants going forward. For those of you who weren't in New York, Ivan Schofield talked about how -- we have -- he doesn't really want to get to over 100 company-owned units in France. So we'll probably stick fairly close, a little higher than the number we have today. However, it's still going to be a pretty high investment model because we've elected, in France, to go with -- well, we call the business rental model, which, is our understanding, pretty similar to what McDonald's has in France and Germany, where we hold the lease and we charge the franchisees a percentage of sales. It varies depending on the level of sales. So that will still be a capital-intensive market for us but less than company-owned stores.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that's something that you expect 3 to 5 years, for example? I mean, I understand that there's a need to seed franchisees and seed markets and get to the critical mass that you need for awareness and advertising and what have you, but that's at least the intention for the foreseeable future?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, John. At this point, that's our intention. We've liked what we've seen so far with the business rental model in those countries. We think it facilitates growth, and we're comfortable sharing in the upside and downside of that market with the people, with our franchisees.","David C. Novak","All right. Thank you very much, for the questions, and let me briefly wrap this up. I'd like to do, if I just talk about one of the initiatives, we're very excited about this year, that we're really driving hard on. And it starts with the fact that for the past 15 years, I've been teaching a leadership program called Taking People With You. And more than 4,000 people in the Yum! system including franchisees have participated in this program. And as I talked about in New York, I recently wrote a book based on this program. Basically, taking people with you includes everything I learned about how to build and align teams to get results and it gleans the best know-how in the world, from top change experts, coaches, CEOs I've interviewed, met with in other leading companies. And what we've done is -- and we're doing now is we're making 2012 the year of taking people with you for operational excellence across Yum! Brands around the world. Basically, we take learnings in the book and we've created training guides that will be made available in 11 different languages to restaurant general managers all around the world. And they will be developing plans with their coaches on how to take people with them in their restaurant to get the single biggest thing that's going to drive performance, operational excellence in their restaurant. And we're very excited about this, because we think it's going to prove to be a real catalyst for us to drive what we call customer mania and improve operational effectiveness. And this is part of a major effort that we embarked upon a couple of years ago internally, which is to build world-class operations. We've been focusing very hard on putting more and more effort and diligence and process and discipline around operating standards and processes and making sure that they're executed. Because we firmly believe that while we have pockets of excellence and operations around the world, particularly in markets like China and India and even in the United States, Taco Bell is top-tier in terms of speed and accuracy, we think we can do better. So we're very, very focused on Taking People With You and using this as a way to drive even more performance in our stores and become more operationally excellent. So very excited about that. This is the year of taking people with you to drive operational excellence all around the world. And by the way, all the proceeds of the book, The Taking People With You, go to United Nation's World Food Programme, which we've made our global corporate social responsibility effort.  And we build awareness of that, the issue of starving children all around the world, leveraging our system. So it -- all of this is geared towards us continuing to make progress as we build the defining global company that feeds the world. We want to have a culture that is world famous for recognition, everyone counts, make our brands vibrant everywhere  we do business, with operational excellence the foundation, which we've made our single biggest priority and we will continue to do in the next 5 years. And then, we want to be a company with a huge heart, which is all geared around providing great jobs for people and also making a difference in the world with the World Food Programme. So very excited about this year, very bullish about the opportunity we have to continue our track record of generating at least 10% earnings per share growth. We always try to do the best we can, and we're very focused on really having an outstanding year and delivering returns for our shareholders. So thank you very much for being on this call, and we look forward to talking to you out in the marketplace and the next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in Yum! Brands Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."],"22953":["Yum! Brands, Inc.

Yum! Brands delivered third quarter core operating profit growth of 11% and EPS growth, excluding special items of 9%. For 2016, we are raising our core operating profit growth guidance from, at least, 14% to at least, 15%, owing to continued strength in our business outside of China and solid profitability in China despite sales headwinds, which I\u2019ll discuss shortly.","Today, I\u2019ll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions, and then David Gibbs, our President and CFO will walk you through the financials. After that the team and I, including the Micky Pant, CEO of Yum! China; and Ted Stedem, CFO of Yum! China will be happy to take any questions you might have.","For those of you who don\u2019t know Ted, he joined the Yum! China team in August. He has been with Yum! for the last seven years and served as CFO of KFC Australia and New Zealand and most recently as a General Manager of our KFC Asia business outside of China. Ted brings significant financial and operational expertise to Micky\u2019s leadership team, as they prepare for the separation.","Now, let\u2019s begin today with China. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, we were pleased with the results we saw through the first six weeks of Q3, as sales were ahead of our plan. However, tougher laps in the second-half of the third quarter, which we built into the forecast were compounded by an international court ruling regarding claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea. The ruling triggered a series of protests and boycotts intensified by social media against a few international companies with well-known Western brands.","At its peak, the demonstrations significantly impacted store traffic in certain trade zones and this was during our busiest season. The impact to our sales was sudden and while difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact on the quarter our best estimate is, there was a 400 to 500 basis point impact to the division\u2019s same-store sales in the quarter.","Most importantly, as we got further away from the incident in July, sales improved. Fourth quarter, which began in September has seen improvement continue with quarter-to-date sales down modestly. We\u2019re encouraged by recent trends through the important Golden Week holiday, which is currently ongoing and optimistic about a strong product and promotional calendar for the balance of the quarter, which Micky will discuss. Given these trends in the business, we expect same-store sales to be positive for the balance of the quarter.","In spite of the external headwind, the team was able to execute well and manage costs, resulting in solid profitability with core operating profit up 14%. It is unfortunate that something outside of our control impacted our sales. But thanks to solid execution it appears to be mostly behind us at this point, and we are moving forward with excitement about the balance of the year with confidence in the long-term potential of this business.","As we prepare to separate the China business, there is a lot to be excited about. First, the strategic partnership we previously announced with Primavera and Ant Financial is a tremendous asset and competitive advantage. Both are well respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners for Yum! China as a standalone public company operating in China.","Second, we are the undisputed category leader in digital engagement. We\u2019re building the world\u2019s greatest loyalty program with a large and growing database to help us drive future sales. Our mobile payment has doubled from 10% to 20% of sales over the last year. And with Ant Financial\u2019s Alipay, we\u2019ll continue to grow.","Third, delivery. We currently offer delivery for more than 4,000 units across China. This is an unmatched and growing platform that affords further growth opportunities.","And finally, idea sharing. As we get closer to separation what is ironic is Yum and the China division have never been closer from a know-how and idea sharing perspective. And this will continue post-separation. You\u2019ll hear a lot more about all of this next week.","Now, onto our three brand divisions, where I\u2019m excited to say, we are on track to deliver another year of strong operating profit growth, which is a testament to the talents and capabilities within the global team. For the third quarter, we\u2019re very pleased that in aggregate, our business outside of China produced 11% core operating profit growth ahead of our expectations.","And what has been an overall sluggish environment for the QSR category, particularly in the United States, two of our three brands have been delivering solid results and have continued to do so into the fourth quarter thus far.","Our KFC Division excelled. Same-store sales grew 4% in the third quarter, or 7% on a two-year stack. Core operating profit grew 19% in the quarter and the division opened 138 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 70% of our new international openings were in emerging markets.","System sales in international developed markets grew 4%, and international emerging markets grew 12%. This brand continues to perform in nearly every market globally, with particular strength in Russia, Continental Europe, and Africa this quarter. And we remain on track to open, at least, 475 net new international units this year, and the U.S. is full steam ahead on its remodel program.","In particular, I\u2019m pleased with the third quarter results out of the U.S., which were driven by the Extra Crispy campaign. We continue to gain traction with our strategy here and our 6% same-store sales growth lapped 2% growth in the prior year. Two-year comps of plus 8 in the quarter are category leading. And this is our 9th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth in the U.S. and speaks to the importance of an aligned franchise system and strong marketing adhering to core, innovation and value.","The KFC U.S. team in partnership with the franchisees have really turned this brand around in the last two years. And the brand\u2019s continued strength in a sluggish QSR market is commendable. This achievement in the U.S. gives me confidence in continued global success, as we share best practices across the system.","Pizza Hut system sales in constant currency were flat and same-store sales declined 1% in the third quarter. The U.S. market was influenced by an unsuccessful promotion and the competitive environment. As we saw earlier this year, we know the brand can perform when the right product is combined with compelling value and the messaging is distinctive and disruptive.","Now, I\u2019m confident in our ability to turn around the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We believe the fundamentals are being put in place and now execution is the focus. Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and flat same-store sales growth in the quarter. Across our international markets, we are leveraging a wealth of proven, ownable value bets to address specific consumer needs and rolling them out rapidly from one market to another.","In Thailand, for example, we took a bold approach to value, leveraging any construct in tandem with significant product and operations improvements and have seen double-digit sales and transaction growth since launch. Other markets now are taking learnings from this significant turnaround. This traction gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut turnaround is underway.","Finally, I\u2019m very pleased to talk about strong performance in the third quarter. Core operating profit grew 9%, U.S. same-store sales grew 3%, even as we lapped a plus 4% from the prior year. This included 1 percentage point of growth in transactions, or over 2 percentage points better than the industry.","Our strategy of bracketing value with $1.49 steak flatbread sandwiches and $5 boxes, which provided abundant value allow us to grow transactions and boost check. Furthermore, we saw impressive results with our breakfast offering in the quarter as transactions grew 14%, driven by a $1 breakfast menu.","We\u2019re now taking the learnings from this success and promoting our All Day dollar menus. This all goes to show that when you remain committed to the core and value, the results follow. In addition to being a clear leader in offering low prices, we are now leading the category in good value for money.","As for Taco Bell development, we remain on plan with at least 300 new restaurant openings for the year. Taco Bell international is an area of enviable growth potential and we are excited to see the momentum behind this strategic objective. While it\u2019s early days, we believe this could be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress.","So 2016 marks the beginning of a massive transformation for Yum!, a transformation that has been years in the making. The first step is the October 31 separation of the China business. This business began with the first KFC in Beijing, nearly 30 years ago and has grown to over 7,000 restaurants in over 1,100 cities. Today, it is one of China\u2019s largest employers with over 400,000 employees, serving over 2 billion customers every year. In short, this business is a powerhouse with unrivaled growth opportunities in the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy.","As we announced on September 2, investments like Primavera Capital Group and Ant Financial bring strategic value and additional local and digital know-how immediately and over the long-term. In addition, on September 15, we announced a world-class Board of Directors for Yum! China with Dr. Fred Hu, Chairman and Founder of Primavera Capital Group to serve as Non-Executive Chairman. I have the utmost confidence that this Board will offer the marketing insights and strategic vision required to enable Yum! China to reach its full potential.","Including the Primavera investments, Yum! China will have a very strong financial foundation, over $900 million of cash and no external debt on the balance sheet at spin. I couldn\u2019t be more optimistic about the future of this business or the great foundation that is now in place for them to begin their journey as an independent company. And I look forward to watching them succeed for many years to come.","So in conclusion, at New Yum! the massive transformation will continue as we become a unique and focused world-class franchisor. Following the separation, we will be roughly 93% franchised with a clear path to reach our stated goal of becoming, at least, 96% of franchised by the end of 2017.","We\u2019ve given a great deal of thought towards creating a high-growth, asset-light efficient company, best position for accelerating growth in global system sales, operating profit, and cash flow. And we\u2019re excited to share more details behind our thinking here next Tuesday. So stay tuned.","And with that, it gives me pleasure to hand over to David Gibbs.","David Gibbs","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll cover three areas. Our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016, and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.","Let\u2019s start with a high level overview of our third quarter performance. We\u2019re pleased the Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 11% in the quarter. In aggregate, our three brand divisions, excluding China delivered 11% core operating profit growth in the quarter, led by 19% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Pizza Hut.","This growth is especially impressive, given how competitive and sluggish the QSR category has been recently, particularly in the U.S.. Combined, our brands are outperforming the category and we\u2019re pleased to see relative outperformance continuing thus far in the fourth quarter.","In our China division, core operating profit grew 14%, despite a 1% decline in same-store sales. The implementation of a value-added tax and continued tight cost controls materially benefited unit economics and enabled us to offset inflation and sales to leverage, primarily resulting from the South China Sea ruling.","As Greg mentioned, tougher back-of-quarter laps were compound by the incident. While it is very difficult to be precise, given all the moving pieces in our China business right now, our best estimate is, this had a 400 to 500 basis point impact to our same-store sales in the quarter. It was most severe in July, primarily affecting our stores in lower tier cities, where the protests were most intense.","The impact continues to dissipate and sales have recovered off their lows. Overall, for the quarter, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 6 point negative impact from foreign currency changes.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our 2016 outlook. As Greg mentioned, we\u2019re raising our 2016 full-year core operating profit growth guidance to, at least, 15% from at least, 14%, including the 53rd week. This increase is supported by strength in our overall business outside China and healthy profitability in China, despite temporary sales headwinds, as we discussed.","As expected, third quarter margins in the China division benefited due in part to the diligent effort across our entire China team in implementing the new VAT. In each of the last two quarters, we highlighted the changes to China\u2019s retail tax structure, which became effective on May 1. The benefit to our business continues to fluctuate from month-to-month, as we refine our ability to get input credits and as the interpretation of the new tax code becomes clear.","As a result, we will not provide precise guidance for the future benefit of this tax change other than to say that, we expect it to be worth, at least, two points of margin upside on a go-forward basis. We still expect full-year China restaurant margins of, at least, 17%. This reflects the ongoing benefit of the VAT, offset by labor and commodity inflation, as well as our investment back into generating sales.","Now, let\u2019s talk about development. Yum! remains one of the leading global retail developers. In the third quarter, we added over 475 total new units, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to nearly 1,150 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the fourth quarter, as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth.","For the full-year, we expect China to add about 525 gross new units and for New Yum! Brands to add over 2,175 units, which will continue to include China. With regards to re-franchising, we\u2019ve committed to becoming, at least, 96% franchised by the end of 2017. Once we finalize the separation of our China business, we will be 93% franchised.","Over the last four quarters, we\u2019ve re-franchised nearly 470 restaurants. In the third quarter specifically, we re-franchised 94 stores, 48 of which were Pizza Hut restaurants. Re-franchising allows us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders, while reducing G&A expenditure as field level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. We look forward to sharing our strategy for improving overall efficiency of Yum! with you next week.","One housekeeping item. Unallocated corporate G&A in the quarter, excluding special items was $44 million, with the increase versus last year largely due to timing. For the full-year, we expect this to come in closer to $205 million, excluding special items.","Now, I\u2019d like to talk about our capital structure. In connection with the pending separation of our China business, we are optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. We closed the previously announced $2.5 billion new senior secured credit facilities and $2.1 billion senior unsecured notes offering on June 16, which was five days into our third quarter. As a result, we have total debt outstanding of $9.2 billion.","Our intention is to maintain leverage equal to about five times EBITDA at New Yum!, while Yum! China should have over $900 million in cash and no external debt at separation. In the quarter, we also swapped a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed, resulting in about 90% of our debt fixed for a total current blended rate of 4.75%.","With this in mind, we expect interest expense of about $300 million in 2016. We\u2019re fully committed to returning cash to shareholders. Last December at our Analyst and Investor Day, we committed to returning approximately $6.2 billion of capital, excluding our ongoing dividend payments between separation announcement and completion, which assumed a year-end 2016 separation of our China division.","In connection with this, we have repurchased approximately 5.3 billion shares at an average price of $81, reducing our share count by approximately 15% as of October 4. We plan to return the remainder of our previously committed $6.2 billion of capital before year end. Including our recently increased quarterly dividend, we have returned $5.2 billion to shareholders year-to-date.","Now, I\u2019d like to quickly update you on our China separation plans. We are on track to complete the separation after the close of business on October 31. On September 23, the Board approved the separation of our China business via a dividend distribution of one share of Yum! China common stock per each share of Yum! Brands common stock held at the close of business on October 19, the record date for the distribution.","We expect to complete the distribution of Yum! China common stock to shareholders on October 31. When issued trading for both Yum! Brands and Yum! China will begin on the NYSE on October 17, and Yum! China will begin trading regular way as an independent company on November 1.","As Greg mentioned, we were pleased with the announced investment in Yum! China by Primavera Capital and Ant Financial. They will make a $460 million strategic investments, reflecting an 8% discount to the volume weighted average trading price in days 31 through 60, following the separation of Yum! China.","Additionally, they will receive two warrant tranches, representing approximately 2% of equity value in each tranche, with strike prices equating to Yum! China equity values of $12 billion and $15 billion. This is an attractive structure for shareholders, as it minimizes upfront solution and highlights the long-term value in Yum! China as an investment.","More importantly, we are thrilled with the strategic partnership and the benefits this offers to Yum! China. Both Primavera and Ant Financial are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners. Dr. Fred who leads Primavera will become the Non-Executive Chairman of Yum! China, and Ant Financial will have an observer seat. Given the value of these ideal partners will bring to the table, we believe Yum! China is set up for success immediately and over the long-term.","So to wrap things up, we had an exogenous and temporary event hit China sales mid-quarter. But we\u2019re able to hold the line on operating profit in China and with the strong performance of our brands outside of China, in aggregate, we have line of sight to at least 15% core operating profit growth for the full-year.","As Greg said, 2016 is a truly transformational year for Yum! We\u2019re nearing completion of the separation of our China business and have secured strong strategic partners. We\u2019ve enhanced our capital structure and we\u2019ve made progress on re-franchising. We look forward to sharing additional details on these matters and more with you at our New York Investor Conference next Tuesday.","And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara, your line is open.","Sara Senatore","Thank you. Thanks very much. I would like to ask just quickly about China and this \u2013 the protest. And in the context of, I think, you\u2019ve laid out sort of comps that over the long-term you would target in the mid single digits. But it feels like, we\u2019ve had a hard time getting there with periodic things that are outside of your control.","So, I guess, the question I have is sort of twofold. One is, is there just a higher country risk now? And does that mean that long-term targets of kind of 4% to 5% maybe are going to be harder to reach? The second point, is there an opportunity to make up some of that top line gap with faster unit growth? Because it looks like unit growth gross units has continued to come down a little bit? Thanks.","Greg Creed","Micky, we\u2019ll let you take that.","Micky Pant","Yes. Well, thank you, Sara. I think the first point nobody likes giving weather and politics and reasons like that for sluggish sales. So trust me, we\u2019re very disappointed with the negative comp number. But this was very unusual. As you know, the first-half of the year, we were trending very nicely. In fact, third quarter \u2013 second quarter of this year was the fourth straight quarter of same-store sales growth. And in Q3, we were trending through the middle of the quarter very strongly. And then right around the July 13, this matter started and we saw a very sharp sudden decline in sales.","The good news was that thereafter the recovery started almost immediately within 10 days or so, but it did have this impact. Two things, first is that unlike a food safety incident research that we\u2019ve conducted has shown that, there has been no damage whatsoever to the brand. Our trends have continued to improve.","And I think the other point, which was mentioned in the \u2013 by both Greg and David, the spin-off coupled with the two very strong strategic partners we\u2019ve got have very deep respect in China I think that will help us in the longer-term in issues and matters like this. I think, if you are at the October 11, Tuesday Investor Meeting in New York, we\u2019ll give you more comfort as to why we feel that we can grow comps into the future. But had it not been for this incident, we would almost certainly have had comp growth in Q3, and we\u2019re expecting from this point onwards through the rest of the year to get back to growth.","Keith Siegner","Next question please.","Sara Senatore","Great.","Micky Pant","As far as the new unit development is concerned, I think for the quarter, I think the impact was, yes, it\u2019s just \u2013 I don\u2019t see any particular reason why we will not have strong new unit growth. Again, we will share more details on the 11. This year, as you know, we did take our Pizza Hut dine-in build rate down from last year\u2019s 280 to about 150. That was done 150 still on a base of 1,500 is about 10%. We felt that was a responsible thing to do and to get Pizza Hut comps back, which are trending upwards. And once that is done, I think, we\u2019ll get back on to a strong growth path. So we don\u2019t see really a sort of ongoing decline in our new unit build rate in China at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is open.","Brian Bittner","Thank you. Good morning, guys. A question on the non-China business. The Taco Bell and KFC businesses are going to be, I think, a little over 80% of new Yum!\u2019s profits after the separation. So it is really nice to see the comp acceleration in the sales at both of those brands. And I guess, this has seemingly happened without an industry acceleration underneath you. So what was it that changed so quickly in the third quarter for both of these brands to really divert from the industry so dramatically? And how much follow-through does this have going forward, the strategy that drove that?","Greg Creed","Thanks, Brian. Yes, I think, I wouldn\u2019t say it was an abrupt change. I think certainly if you take the U.S., I mean, KFC U.S. has just delivered its 9th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. There\u2019s no doubt the plus 6 rolling over plus 2 and plus 8 is definitely means, we\u2019re growing share in the category, which is great.","I put it down to, and if you think about what we ran in the quarter, we essentially ran extra crispy chicken, which we\u2019ve had for over 40 years in a $5 dollar box and a $20 bucket. I think what it demonstrates is, when you have distinctive and disruptive positioning and breakthrough advertising with great product quality and very good operations, I think, what you\u2019ll see is, you can get the customer to actually come in more often.","And so I think that was certainly the KFC story. I was particularly proud of what the Taco Bell team did and how quickly they reacted to their Q2 minus one number to change the calendar for Q3. It\u2019s not easy to do. So a huge callout to the Taco Bell team for basically getting us back into 1.29 flatbread, the Triple Double Crunchwrap, which did incredibly well and obviously then putting it in a $5 box.","So, I think, the answer is, we\u2019re back to the core selling great core products. We\u2019ve got distinctive and disruptive advertising and positioning and I think that\u2019s the cornerstone for success.","Brian Bittner","And the $1 all day menu at Taco Bell that you talked about, is that the same as the $1 cravings menu that you\u2019ve had, or is there something incremental coming on the all day $1?","Greg Creed","Yes. So they ran a $1 breakfast menu through the quarter. And that, as you saw, delivered a really impressive 14% transaction growth in that daypart. What they\u2019ve done is, they\u2019ve now taken that to an all day value menu play, which has only just started in the marketplace. I think, as I said, what is impressive is not only do we have now the market leading position for a lot of prices we now have the category leading position for every day great value. And so I think that you\u2019re seeing these brands, particularly both of these brands strengthen in the marketplace.","Brian Bittner","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John, your line is open.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Micky, I wanted to maybe just go back to you and talk a little bit more broadly about how your strategy in China is evolving. I think when you came in you focused more on the core, the buckets, and the value boxes. So what\u2019s working now in China? Do you need more value \u2013 and how have you used this crisis and how have you responded to it maybe differently than you\u2019ve done in prior periods if there has been any response? Can you talk a little bit about product evolution and price evolution? And I think in the past you\u2019ve given sort of the breakdown in China between traffic ticket and pricing, if you could provide that for this quarter? Thanks.","Micky Pant","Sure. Firstly, what\u2019s working is, I was struck by when Greg was talking about the KFC U.S. business is very similar things. As you probably know, we did divert capital to store refurbishment in a very large way, so we\u2019ll give more details on the 11th, but we\u2019ve improved the look and feel of our stores quite considerably, especially in the larger cities.","We did focus on our core bestsellers. So we did simplify the menu just a little bit. But the core bestsellers, including fried chicken, [indiscernible] sandwich were dialed up, and that is having a beneficial effect. Key price points, especially that crucial RMB29, RMB39 price points, which are the last two price points in this market.","And lastly, digital. I think digital has been probably the most significant growth area for us. Our cashless payments have grown from 10% to 20% in a very short period of time. We expect that to continue as we partner up with people like Alipay to expand it. And our loyalty programs are significant now. So the percentage of transactions that are being scanned at the till for loyalty points is very significant. And overall spend on digital has become a very large part of our total marketing spend.","All this put together is having good results. And we\u2019ve accordingly geared our calendar for the balance of this year, as well as for next year. So both on KFC and Pizza Hut considerable attention to core product key price points and continued in-store execution. And that really is what\u2019s working.","John Glass","And just the breakdown between traffic ticket and pricing","Micky Pant","That strategy \u2013 sorry, the second part of your question.","David Gibbs","Sure. To give you the breakdown, we had a pricing impact of plus 1%. We had a mix impact of plus 3%, and we had transactions down 6% to deliver our same-store sales.","John Glass","Thank you so much.","Keith Siegner","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open.","Michael Barbarula","Yes. Hi, thank you for the question. This is Michael on for John. Just on G&A in the context of being a 96% franchised business and post-spin, how is the company going to think about G&A? Will you look at G&A on a per store basis, or a percent of system sales? We are just trying to get a sense of what the right metric is and if there\u2019s a target or a benchmark? Thank you.","Greg Creed","Yes, that\u2019s something that we plan on addressing in great detail at the Investor Conference next Tuesday. And we\u2019ll probably give you a couple of different ways to think about it and some frameworks. But we\u2019ll mostly be focused on G&A as a percentage of system sales.","Michael Barbarula","Thank you.","Keith Siegner","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America. Joe, your line of open.","Joseph Buckley","Thank you. The question is on China, as well. I know you said that the sales impact is dissipating and you expect to be positive in China for the balance of the quarter. Does that mean that for the full quarter you\u2019re expecting China comps to be positive? And then also on China, you mentioned the VAT tax having at least a 200 basis point benefit on a go-forward basis. Was that the benefit in the third quarter? Can you share that with us as well, please?","David Gibbs","Let\u2019s take the first.","Micky Pant","Yes, sure. Look there was a benefit in the third quarter and it\u2019s an ongoing benefit and it\u2019s significant. I\u2019ll let Ted answer that question. So maybe, Ted, do you want to start with that and then I can get to the other part.","Ted Stedem","Sure. On the VAT, as David said, we\u2019re still in the early months of the implementation of the VAT and the impact it has fluctuated since it was implemented. In the third quarter, it\u2019s fair to assume that the VAT was the primary driver of our margin improvement.","David Gibbs","This is David. Just on the question about the guidance for the quarter, we don\u2019t, as you know, we don\u2019t typically provide guidance for sales in the quarter. But we did obviously mention, that we feel better about the balance of the quarter. We\u2019ve got some great promotions on the calendar in November and December that we\u2019re really excited about. And that\u2019s why we feel bullish on the balance of the quarter. But I\u2019ll let Micky talk a little bit more about some of those promotions and the impact we\u2019re expecting on the business.","Micky Pant","Yes. Well, as you know, it\u2019s a four-month quartet and we\u2019ve passed September, which is a tough lap for us. We\u2019re in the middle of the Golden Week, which is the second most significant holiday after the Chinese New Year, and that is going well at this time. It\u2019s a peak selling period and comps are good. Thereafter, what we\u2019ve got in the month of November is a winning item that\u2019s been tested very well and we\u2019ve done well in the past extended through November, which is the snack platter, which is a good example of how KFC in China is unique in the sense that the snack platter has got four parts to it and three of them are familiar to people from anywhere in the world, which is French fries, popcorn, chicken, and hot wings.","But the fourth part is squid, fried squid, which is quite unique to hear. It\u2019s done very well in the past. We\u2019ve got that at a very keen price point of 29. So we feel very good about our November calendar. And then in December for the first time last year, we started Christmas promotion. Christmas is not a traditional holiday in China, and the response is pretty good. So we\u2019re taking that to another level this year with covering the entire gamut from low-end meals at RMB35 to a bucket for families at RMB98. And with a lot of innovation taken from winning items from around the world.","So, December, I think, for the Christmas promotion looks particularly strong, and that\u2019s what gives us confidence in the balance of the quarter. So obviously, we can \u2013 we\u2019ll report Q4 when Q4 has done. But at this time felt the incident we feel is behind us. The Golden Week is going quite well and the calendar looks very strong.","Keith Siegner","All right. Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC. David, your line is open.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. The third quarter China restaurant margins were very close to peak levels even with well below peak AUVs. With the help of ongoing sales improvement and the VAT, where do you think margins can go over time for restaurants in China? And using your previous comments, just a quick clarification on the cash back to shareholders, it looks like you\u2019ve got almost $1 billion left, and I assume that that will go to the New Yum! and add to that the $4 billion less to get to your $10 billion target, it looks like you might have $5 billion over the next two-plus years. Is that right, and will that likely be share repurchase? Thank you.","Greg Creed","Just taking the second part of that question, it\u2019s correct I think we have about $900 million to return to shareholders for the balance of the year in terms of cash buybacks.","David Gibbs","And some of that will be completed between now and spin and the balance of it will be after spin as well.","Greg Creed","Right. I think our original guidance was, we get this all done by spin. But the spin has actually moved up a couple of months from when we thought it would be done at the end of the year.","Then on the second question on margin \u2013 future margin guidance for China, obviously, we\u2019re getting that that benefit as Ted mentioned that we estimate to be, at least, two points, of course, that\u2019s going to help our margins. But at this point in time, we\u2019re not going to provide margin guidance for next year. But I think as the China team becomes a separate public entity they will certainly providing more detail on those kinds of issues.","David Palmer","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of\u2026","Ted Stedem","Yes, just to add to that David on the profitability overall for the quarter and even though the sales were not where we wanted them, operating profit grew very well. And our cumulative operating profit in three quarters was about equal to what we did in all of last year. So in some ways, the fourth quarter profit is going to be growth. And that\u2019s a big credit to our teams, where as you know, we own our entire supply chain and control it very carefully. So we have very good control on input, taxes, et cetera, and that\u2019s all helped us to get strong margin profit performance.","Keith Siegner","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Baird. David, your line is open.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. I have a clarification question on the recent sales trends we\u2019ve seen in China. Micky, do you think the issue around the protest is still impacting the sales? I know you mentioned sales are modestly negative quarter to-date. Is that issue still lingering, and if so how are you measuring that and what do you think the underlying trend really is quarter to-date?","Micky Pant","Well, we\u2019ve done two rounds of research where we actually measured sentiment and we had percentage of consumers reporting less inclination to go to one of our restaurants on account of the protest specifically, that number came down for us sharply. Now remember, the quarter-to-date includes all of September. And with that month gone behind us, I think, it\u2019s safe to say that the protest impact is now is very small, if not negligible.","So I think that we can put behind us now. It always takes a little while to regain momentum once you get going in operations and everything else. So this October holiday is going to be quite crucial and determining that and our intention then is to keep the momentum.","David Tarantino","Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. You mentioned, I think David mentioned in his script that there was some investments in driving sales planned in the fourth quarter. I know you mentioned some of these promotions, but can you maybe elaborate on what the investment side of that equation looks like?","David Gibbs","Yes, we expect our overall A&P to be at the same level that we had always budgeted. We have made, because we had this margin benefit. We did invest some of it back. Some of it has gone into increasing \u2013 increase advertising spend on Pizza Hut. We think Pizza Hut got a good chance to recover momentum. We got soft laps for the fourth quarter. And we\u2019ve got some very good promotions in November and at Christmas, and we\u2019re putting additional money and advertising promotion behind those.","We\u2019ve also got some unique China only deals with international IP on films, movies. And also, we\u2019ve got maybe three of the best celebrities available in China across the two brands, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve made investments. But it\u2019s all within what we\u2019d originally budgeted. So if your question implies that there will be any deterioration and profitability on account of that, that\u2019s not going to happen.","David Tarantino","Thank you.","David Gibbs","Key leverage will still be sales and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is open.","Greg Lum","Hi, good morning. This is actually Greg Lum for Karen today. I was just wondering if you could provide a quick update on the pace of remodels in China? And then based on the current units, what is the current average sales lift that you are seeing?","David Gibbs","Sure.","Micky Pant","October 11, we\u2019ll give a lot more detail. I don\u2019t have the number off the top of my head, but maybe Ted you can help. We have accelerated the rate of refurbish very quite dramatically, and we\u2019ll give you more numbers on the 11th. And I think what happens with refurbish is that, it\u2019s very difficult to quantify exactly the impact until you the get estate fixed. And when a certain percentage of the estate becomes current, then you get quite a substantial benefit, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting in time to come.","We\u2019re very keen to keep the estate current, because China architectural standards, especially in the bigger cities have gone up dramatically over the last several years with a lot of international entries, and we have been left behind a little bit. So that has been corrected quite substantially.","Ted Stedem","Sure. On the remodels, we\u2019re planning to do about 780 remodels this year, and this is going to be about a 50% increase versus what we did in 2015. And year-to-date, we\u2019ve completed a little over half. I think, we\u2019d say, we\u2019re getting great feedback from our consumers. We contemporized the experience. We\u2019ve made the restaurants more youthful, more energetic. And overall, I think, it\u2019s a very positive effect on the image of the brands, and we\u2019ll give you more updates at our conference next week.","Greg Lum","Thank you, Ted.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions. One, maybe David on the New Yum!, I mean, just looking at the operating margins this past quarter for proxy, I mean, they expended a couple of hundred basis point at each brand despite the mixed results and you are running from the low to the high 20% range in each of those brands. I\u2019m just wondering directionally perhaps how you think about the opportunity there with presumably the re-franchising? I mean, it seems like there is modest further re-franchising from here, but where you think those margins or what gating factors are there on that margin?","And another question, Greg, just on Taco Bell, I mean a very strong result and it sounds like you attribute most of that to product news and more so on the value front. So with that as a backdrop, I\u2019m just wondering whether Taco Bell still aspires for more of that premium push and why you think the QSR category has been sluggish recently? I think you mentioned the category softness. I\u2019m just wondering what you attribute that to? Thanks.","Ted Stedem","Yes, the first question on operating margins, obviously, as we move to an asset-light model, we\u2019re excited about its signification expansion in our operating margins. We\u2019ll give you a lot more color on the exact refranchising plans and how that would play out in terms of operating margin next week. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg for the second question.","Greg Creed","I think Taco Bell is doing a lot of things right. It\u2019s not just the core product, it\u2019s not just the great value. Their assets are in great shape. The customer experience they\u2019re delivering is really, I think, as good as you\u2019ll find in the marketplace. They\u2019re obviously trying to make \u2013 this is becoming a incredibly culturally relevant brand, I think being a part of a millennial culture is what\u2019s really driving this performance.","So I\u2019m very excited at all the things they\u2019re doing, I think sets us up for a continued long-term growth just across the broad front of all the things you want great brands to be doing.","Jeffrey Bernstein","And in terms of the sluggish category, any thoughts on what you can attribute that to or?","Greg Creed","Sorry. Look, it\u2019s hard to say that. We\u2019ve been doing a bunch of work just talking to different to millennials, Gen X, Gen Y, Boomers. I think where we\u2019re what five weeks away from a general election, I think there\u2019s just great uncertainty as to what\u2019s going to happen in the U.S., in particular, as a result of the outcome of the election. It goes without saying that people are sort of trying to decide who to choose and what the impact will be on the economy. And I think people maybe just hunkering down a little bit.","But that said, that\u2019s why I think I\u2019m even more pleased with the performance of KFC and Taco Bell in the quarter, because despite that uncertainty those two brands, I think, in being incredibly distinctive and disruptive and going back to the quarter, delivering great experiences, making sure the value was right. Those \u2013 that\u2019s how you win even in a sluggish market. And I think there are lessons that we\u2019re also applying around the rest of the world. I mean, KFC outside of the U.S. had a \u2013 had just a gangbuster quarter probably with the exception of Japan, developed markets, developing markets. You can ask me any country, and I\u2019ll show you incredible sales growth.","So I think the global growth of the KFC brand and the momentum it has and the strength that we\u2019ve now got in the U.S. sets that up for particular strength. Taco Bell, as I said across all the fact that you want to a brand to be strong at is just paring ahead. And I think once we get through the election and then that uncertainty is removed, hopefully, the market will find some momentum. But I\u2019m really confident that our brands can grow in either strong markets or markets that don\u2019t have the momentum we\u2019d love to have.","Keith Siegner","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Matt, your line is open.","Matt McGinley","My question is on the full-year guidance of 15% for operating profit growth. I know that includes the 53rd week, which I think at the beginning of the year you said was around 1.5, China for the full-year, I think, you said would be 20 and you always have that fourth quarter step down just based on seasonality, and I think you said the full-year would be 17.","So my question is on the New Yum! Business, which they\u2019ve been running 9, 4 and 4 respectively for the three brands, you are going to have a step-up, part of it\u2019s going to be from the 53rd week, but there\u2019s also something else in there that I think implies you\u2019re going to have a bigger step-up. And I guess, my question is what inflects within the New Yum! outside of the 53rd week to get you to that full-year 15% operating profit guide?","David Gibbs","Well, I guess, we\u2019d always anticipated the fourth quarter to be the best quarter of the year in terms of core operating profit growth. And that gets into a lot of features of our business performed last year expenses that we\u2019re lapping and things like that. I can\u2019t give you a precise answer other than to say the guidance was raised, because we do feel confident that the fourth quarter with the momentum that our brands have and the plans that we have in the fourth quarter and how they\u2019re tracking against those plans gives us lots of confidence and our ability to generate more profit than we thought this time last quarter.","Keith Siegner","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Andrew, your line is open.","Andrew Charles","Thank you. Just to clarify, was Taco Bell traffic ex-breakfast positive? And then my question was Taco Bell performed well on a difficult industry backdrop and obviously the competitive promotional environment continues to be pretty fierce. But I was wondering about the decision to launch a $1 all day menu as you guys seem to be seeing success with the $5 box strategy and, Greg, the core value strategy you outlined earlier. Presumably, these $1 menus, obviously $1 offerings have better margin \u2013 excuse me, the obviously, the core value offerings seem to have better margins than the $1 menu deal that you would be launching in the context of an inflationary labor environment?","Greg Creed","So I guess my answer is, I think transaction would have been slightly positive. Obviously, we had a significant growth, as we said in breakfast, but I think without breakfast, transactions would have been slightly positive. I think the key to Taco Bell success it\u2019s just not just the one show pony. We didn\u2019t just do dollar menus. We also did Triple Double Crunchwrap in $5 boxes. So I think it\u2019s our ability to have great value and value isn\u2019t just what you pay, it\u2019s what you get.","And I think if you look at what\u2019s in the boxes, or if you look at now the Sony promotion we\u2019re doing right now, which from the millennial point of view, it\u2019s an incredibly attractive promotional offer. I know the Sony boxm, the team is very happy with performance of the Sony box as we go into the fourth quarter, which is why we said we have momentum.","So I think transactions were probably slightly up, ex-breakfast margins in the quarter, I think, we\u2019re well over 21% close to 22%. I\u2019ve been talking with some Taco Bell franchisees, I can assure you they love those sort of margins. And I think, as I see it with the work that Brian and the team is doing, we\u2019re set up for continued success at Taco Bell going forward.","Andrew Charles","Thanks.","Keith Siegner","Thanks. And next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank. Brett, your line is open.","Brett Levy","Good morning. Can you dive a little bit deeper into the U.S. competitive landscape? Obviously, we\u2019ve talked about value and premium, but what are your thoughts with respect to traditional and non-traditional competition, especially with all the talk that\u2019s going on about food at home and away from home deflation?","Greg Creed","Yes, look, I think we\u2019re all reading the same reports, whether they\u2019re industry reports or the newspaper, or what\u2019s online. There\u2019s no doubt that food from the grocery stores has declined. But not to say therefore some people aren\u2019t choosing to cook more at home. I think the fundamentals of what QSR office, which is always convenience and value will always be there. And as I said, in any market strong markets or sluggish markets, there always be winners and losers. And I think, having the right tactics in order to ensure that you win is, what\u2019s critical.","And obviously, in the quarter, two of the brands delivered and we\u2019ve got lessons from that. And I\u2019m very confident that we can continue to apply those lessons to KFC and to Taco Bell and that we can apply those lessons to Pizza Hut. And there will be a lot more on the Pizza Hut story, but we\u2019ll talk about next Tuesday. And I know that Pizza Hut team is looking forward to telling you about their plans to reignite growth in that brand as well.","David Gibbs","Thanks. My next weekend is\u2026","Keith Siegner","Next question, please, sorry.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis, your line is open.","Dennis Geiger","Hi, thanks for the question. Greg, off the back of what you just said about Pizza Hut and more detail next week, is there anything that you can share on the strategy in the U.S.? Specifically, if you could provide the US company-owned number relative to the system, which I think you provided last quarter as a way to kind of seize some of the traction from the initiatives? And anything you can share on the easy and better initiatives or the local value message would be helpful? Thanks.","Greg Creed","Yes, sure. Well, I think the good news is next Tuesday Artie will take you through a lot about the whole easy and better strategy for the U.S. And obviously, Milind will talk about what\u2019s happening internationally. What I can tell you is during the quarter, the company same-store sales were 3 points ahead of system and transactions were 6 points ahead of the systems. So again, the company outperformed the system. And obviously, we\u2019re working with the franchisees to bring them along to sort of deliver that improved performance across the entire brand.","Keith Siegner","Thanks. We have time for one more question please.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jeremy Scott with CLSA. Jeremy, your line is open.","Jeremy Scott","Hey, good morning. Can you update us on the competitive activity in the O2O space in China? I have to assume that after about two years or so promotions and consolidation that within the industry these offers and incentives would start to wind down. So if you could just comment on that?","And then secondarily, what percentage of your system sales are now moving through delivery channels? And then what percentage of those delivery sales are moving through the third parties?","Micky Pant","Yes. Well, I think the space is still growing. We track \u2013 we repeatedly practice through industry monitors as well as we are looking at it very closely just internally to make sure we don\u2019t miss an opportunity. The gross merchandise volume is still growing. For us, the total delivery volume is approximately 10% of our sales, so circa $600 million, $700 million a year will go through delivery. The percentage that goes through aggregators, I don\u2019t have, it\u2019s not a very large percentage of what we have. Pizza Hut dine-in is significant and will grow through aggregators. But for the rest of it, it\u2019s mainly our own delivery systems.","We are listed with the major aggregators. So we are present in all of them. It is true that there has been a lot of fallout, because in profitability of the aggregators reportedly is very negative. So, of course, the big three companies will still continue to support their delivery engines. But the rate of discounting, et cetera, I think has moderated over time. But it\u2019s still is a growth area.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Keith Siegner for closing remarks.","Keith Siegner","All right. great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Once again please remember to mark your calendars for upcoming Analyst Investor event. We look very forward to speaking with you next Tuesday.

You may begin your conference.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Novak, Chairman and CEO; Rick Carucci, President; and Pat Grismer, our CFO.","Before we get started, I would also like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.","In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum!

Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in the future use of the recording.","Finally, we would like you to be aware of the following Yum! investor events occurring in the next three months. Our Yum! Restaurants International investor and analyst conference will be on August 21, in Plano, Texas. Our Yum! China investor and analyst conference will be on September 9 and 10 in Shanghai, China. And our third quarter earnings release will be Tuesday, October 8.","I would now like to turn the call over to David Novak.","David Novak ","Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. The second quarter was extremely challenging for Yum! Brands, but sales and profits were generally in line with what we had previously communicated. Earnings per share, excluding special items, declined 16% versus prior year, as our China division operating profit fell 63% prior to foreign currency translation. Operating profit increased 12% at Yum! Restaurants International, and 4% in our U.S. business.","Now, there\u2019s obviously been a lot going on with our KFC business in China, so let me give you an update on our progress. Beginning in April, KFC sales in China were significantly impacted by the intense media surrounding avian flu. The quarter was also impacted by the residual effect of the poultry supply incident, which occurred in late December.","Fortunately, the extensive media surrounding avian flu in China has subsided, and same-store sales at KFC are on the road to recovery. In fact, our KFC same-store sales decline in June was 13% versus the 26% decline we just reported for the second quarter. This is clearly another improvement in our trend, and further evidence the brand is continuing to recover from both avian flu and the poultry supply incident.","I was just recently with our China team and I can assure you they are weathering the adversity and executing with a great sense of urgency. So even though we believe the gift of time will be the most important contributor to our ongoing KFC sales recovery, the team remains extremely focused and are taking the necessary steps to get sales back on track as soon as possible.","For example, we launched a quality assurance advertising campaign in mid-April reminding consumers of our commitment to quality in China and that properly cooked chicken is perfectly safe to eat. Our quality assurance message speaks directly to young families, encouraging them to come back to KFC because of the care we take and the safety of our supply chain.","In addition, we recently launched a new value initiative centered on wings, a customer favorite, and we have significant news coming on the chicken front. We\u2019re also advertising protein alternatives that are available at KFC such as our shrimp and mushroom rolls.","Looking ahead, we believe we will have solid marketing and product news coming later this year. We\u2019re hopeful these initiatives will contribute to our overall sales recovery and help build additional momentum balance of the year. We are confident KFC remains a power brand with a great future.","Speaking of power brands in China, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the very strong performance of Pizza Hut casual dining, which delivered solid same-store sales growth in the quarter, up 7% on top of 10% in the second quarter of last year.","Pizza Hut continues to lead with innovation and everyday affordable value. We just launched a major new product with Stone Pan Sizzling Steak that we know our customers will love. We\u2019re also continuing to leverage our assets by expanding our breakfast menu into more and more cities.","Pizza Hut casual dining is unquestionably the leading Western casual dining concept in China, with over 900 units in 228 cities. Importantly, we continue to have less than three year cash paybacks on new units and the business is on track to deliver another strong year in 2013.","With the terrific performance we are seeing, we continue to broaden our new unit development at Pizza Hut and are aggressively expanding into lower-tier cities. We are very bullish on Pizza Hut casual dining. With both KFC and now Pizza Hut, we are in the early stages of our growth, with a long runway ahead.","In addition, we continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut home service, which is in the home delivery category, now has 171 units in 21 cities. We now have strong unit economics and will ultimately scale Pizza Hut delivery service across the country, which is obviously more good news for the powerful Pizza Hut brand in China.","We\u2019re also making slow but steady progress with East Dawning, our Chinese fast food concept, but still have much work to do to develop a scalable business model. With respect to Little Sheep, as I had mentioned on prior calls, the results have been soft due in part to the long approval process and transition of the acquisition.","We\u2019ve been working hard to reconcept the brand to accelerate long term growth. However, we are now facing the brunt of negative publicity resulting from quality issues at other competitive hot pot concepts in China. This has resulted in a huge cloud over the hot pot category. As the category leader, Little Sheep sales have been significantly impacted, even though there never was an issue with Little Sheep quality.","We believe we will weather this issue over time. Nevertheless, our path to new unit expansion is taking longer than we envisioned. But we will continue to invest in the brand. Our goal remains to aggressively expand over the longer term.","So let me wrap up our China business. Even with our recent challenges in China, we are focused on the long term, and we\u2019re as bullish as ever about our growth prospects. We like how we\u2019re positioned in a country with over 1 billion people, and even though the economy is slowing, it\u2019s still the world\u2019s fastest growing economy, and is expected to grow about 7% this year.","The macro trend we continue to be most enthusiastic about is the growing consumer class, which is estimated to be about 300 million people today and growing to over 600 million by 2020, and disposable incomes are growing right alongside it. In 2013, our new unit development target of at least 700 new stores remains unchanged. This means we will have opened about 1,600 new units in a two-year period and the sales continue to recover at KFC. Our goal is to have substantial momentum heading into 2014.","Outside of China, we continue to expect on target performance for Yum! Brands, and we are well-positioned to deliver against our operating profit targets for the year. At Yum! Restaurants International, the business continues to have a solid year, led primarily by high-growth emerging markets such as South Africa, Russia, and Thailand.","And even though we\u2019re being affected by a moderating global economy, new unit development remains extremely robust. In fact, we recently met with over 400 of our franchise partners representing 100 countries at our biannual franchise convention, which was held this year in Beijing.","As evidence of our franchisees\u2019 enthusiasm for our brands, we expect to open at least 1,000 new units at YRI this year, about 900 of which will be developed by franchisees. Our franchisees\u2019 spirits are extremely high, and it is clear they remain committed to long term growth.","In the United States, our overall same-store sales were positive, and we continue to be particularly pleased with Taco Bell. Taco Bell continues to have momentum and the franchise community is clearly excited about the future growth strategies of the brand.","I recently met with Franmac, the Taco Bell franchise leadership committee, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going too far when I say they are extremely enthusiastic about our Live Mas advertising campaign as well as our innovative new product platforms, Doritos Locos Tacos, and Cantina Bell.","They also told me they are optimistic about our national breakfast launch in 2014. It\u2019s great to have such a progressive group of leaders at Taco Bell. They know we\u2019re building the brand the right way for the long term, see the importance of leveraging our assets throughout the day, and are committed to operational excellence.","I\u2019m also pleased that 2013 will mark the second consecutive year of net new unit growth in our U.S. divisions, led by new unit development at Pizza Hut, which will open about 125 net new units and Taco Bell, which will open around 80 net new units.","In India, it\u2019s full speed ahead with new unit development as we expect to open 150 new units this year and double our restaurant count by 2015 to around 1,000 units. We have recently launched major value initiatives for each of our brands that are driving sales and further improving our business model.","So to wrap it all up, the China recovery is progressing as expected, and YRI, India, and the U.S. are basically on target with our expectations. We expect 2014 will be a strong bounce back year, so in 2013, we will continue to invest in our core business, continue to pay a meaningful dividend, and continue to repurchase shares.","Now let me hand it over to Rick Carucci who will take you through our strategies for Yum! Restaurants International and our U.S. business.","Rick Carucci ","Thank you, David. Good morning. Today, in addition to talking about our results at Yum! Restaurants International in the U.S., I will also describe the diversity of our franchise business at YRI. I will then show how portfolio actions and new unit development are improving results, margins, and our growth proposition in the U.S.","At Yum! Restaurants International, our strategy is to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere. On our last earnings call, I mentioned that the YRI franchise revenue stream is large, growing, global, and diversified.","In the 10-year period from 2002 to 2012, our franchise units almost doubled, from 7,000 to 13,000. YRI\u2019s franchisees have tripled over the same timeframe, from almost $300 million to about $900 million. This year, franchise fees will reach nearly $1 billion. So clearly, this revenue stream is large and growing.","Let me now spend a minute talking about how diversified this global portfolio is. Let\u2019s first look at the regional balance. We have a large and growing presence in Asia, which accounts for 28% of our franchise fees. The Americas account for 22% of our fees. Europe also accounts for 22% of YRI fees. To round out the world, 16% of our franchise fees come from the Middle East and Africa, and 12% from Australia and New Zealand.","In addition to having strong regional balance, our franchise fees reflect our dominant presence in high-growth emerging markets. Emerging markets currently account for about 45% of our revenue stream, but make up a higher percentage of our growth. As an example, in our most recent quarter, 63% of our new units were opened in emerging markets.","We also continue to enter new emerging markets. In the past 12 months alone, KFC has entered Argentina, the Ukraine, Malawi, Angola, and just last month, we opened the first Western concept to enter Outer Mongolia. You really know you have a global concept when you can proudly open up restaurants in Outer Mongolia.","When you put it all together, YRI\u2019s fees are generated from over 100 countries. Furthermore, no single country at YRI represents more than 10% of our franchise revenue stream. This level of diversification is second to none. We believe this large, growing, global, and diversified income stream is extremely valuable to our shareholders.","Now, at YRI we typically use the franchise model. We have also said that we will develop a company-owned presence in select high growth countries that meet our ownership criteria. These include the ability to build scale, establish a leadership position, and generate strong returns.","Last quarter I talked a bit about growth markets where we recently acquired equity: Russia, South Africa, and Turkey. Today, I\u2019ll highlight Thailand, an emerging market where we have had company ownership for quite some time.","Excluding China and the U.S., we have more company-owned restaurants in Thailand than anywhere else in the world. We have 544 total units, 360 of which are company-owned. Thailand is clearly a strong performer and growth driver for YRI.","Since 2009, system sales have almost doubled, operating profit has tripled, and restaurant margins have increased from 14% to almost 20% today. We have clear brand leadership in Thailand. In fact, we have 473 KFCs, compared to 184 units for McDonalds. We plan on extending our lead with plans to build at least 40 additional units this year. We also have 71 Pizza Huts.","Given our powerful brand positions and attractive unit economics, we\u2019re confident Thailand will continue to provide meaningful growth for years to come. Overall, we\u2019re extremely excited about our YRI growth opportunities and our new unit development.","In 2012, we opened a record 949 new units, and added 513 net new units. This year we expect another new record. As David mentioned, our new unit development target for 2013 is now at least 1,000 new units, including 600 net new units. This represents an increase from the 950 new units we were expecting coming into the year.","This accelerated growth in net new unit count is significant for two reasons. First, 2013 will be the second consecutive year where we will generate 4% growth in YRI net new units. Second, this accelerating pace excludes India, which was a key growth driver for YRI before it was separated into its own division in 2012.","And while development is a key driver of our growth, our ongoing growth model also calls for 2-3% growth in same-store sales. During the quarter, YRI delivered same-store sales growth of 1%, primarily due to weakness in Japan and the U.K.","However, our emerging market business continues to see momentum, boasting 5% growth in same-store sales during the quarter. We\u2019re especially pleased with the progress in Russia and South Africa as they continue to grow same-store sales while also developing new units.","YRI is on track to achieve its ongoing growth target of 10% profit growth as the upside in new unit development, combined with recent portfolio actions, are helping to offset the shortfall in same-store sales growth.","Now, on to our U.S. business. Our U.S. strategy should dramatically improve our brand positions, consistency, and returns. There are three factors that are helping us achieve this: Our ownership structure, the strength of the Taco Bell business, and our development program.","In terms of our franchise ownership, a decade ago 28% of our units were company-owned, while 72% were franchise. Through our franchising efforts, we are now 90% franchised. This should help deliver more consistency going forward since there is less profit volatility associated with a franchise business.","One measure where you can see how portfolio actions have changed the nature of the business is operating margin. In 2009, our full year operating margin in the U.S. was 14.5%. For 2012, operating margin was 19.9%. Year to date, in 2013, our U.S. operating margin is 24%, up 4 points over prior year, and up 9.5% since 2009.","As we have said before, our U.S. business has become more weighted towards Taco Bell performance. Taco Bell currently contributes about 50% of our U.S. operating profit, and our ownership structure reflects this. We now have 5% ownership of KFC and about 8% ownership of Pizza Hut. However, we are targeting our Taco Bell ownership at about 15%.","While we are more dependent on Taco Bell the brand is currently performing. If you look at the entire U.S. QSR landscape, I think you could make the argument that Taco Bell has done the most in the last 18 to 24 months to improve its competitive position. The team has done a great job at product innovation, and at the same time the Live Mas brand positioning has really resonated with consumers.","Taco Bell grew same-store sales by 2% in the quarter. This is on top of the 13% growth in the same quarter last year, which included the historic launch of Doritos Locos Tacos. We actually sold 100 million Doritos Locos Tacos during the second quarter of 2013, and it continues to be one of the most successful new product launches in our history. Our innovative use of social media contributed to the success of Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos, and is an overall strength of our brand.","So all in all, we are quite pleased with Taco Bell. Our ongoing product innovation is backed by solid operations and increased media rates. We believe Taco Bell is well-positioned to complete a successful year in 2013.","Now let me give you a brief update on KFC and Pizza Hut. In the second quarter, KFC delivered same-store sales growth of 3%, driven by the launch of KFC\u2019s original recipe boneless chicken. However, sales at Pizza Hut were weak. In this environment, you win by delivering a consistent and compelling value message, and our competitors have simply done a better job in this area so far this year.","We\u2019ll have a more consistent value message going forward, and we continue to introduce new innovative products such as our flatbread pizza. We expect to deliver better sales growth at Pizza Hut during the balance of this year.","And as David said, another piece of exciting news in the U.S. is that in 2013 we\u2019ll be at a net new unit growth position for the second year in a row. This is once again led by new unit development at both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, as well as less contraction in KFC.","The combination of more consistent growth in new unit development in the U.S., combined with accelerating new unit development at YRI, gives us great confidence in our long term growth model for each of these divisions.","In fact, in 2009, our YRI and U.S. divisions opened over 1,100 units, including nearly 300 net new units. This year, we expect these divisions, plus India, to open about 1,500 new units, including over 800 net new units. This increase bodes well for our future.","So to sum it all up, while China is clearly experiencing a challenging year, the rest of Yum! continues to hold up pretty well. Now let me hand things over to Pat Grismer, our CFO.","Pat Grismer","Thank you, Rick. Our second quarter earnings per share were obviously very weak, due to the temporary sharp decline in our KFC business in China, but we expected these results as previously communicated.","The important thing to focus on is that our KFC China business is clearly recovering, demonstrating solid improvement in same-store sales. Additionally, our other key businesses, including Pizza Hut in China, are delivering results that are generally in line with our growth targets.","Over the next few minutes, I\u2019ll provide some additional perspective on our second quarter results, our EPS expectations for the full year, and our preliminary thoughts on 2014. For the second quarter, we recorded a 16% decline in EPS before special items, due to the significant challenges we faced in China, partially offset by growth in our YRI and U.S. divisions and a lower tax rate.","In China, operating profit declined 63% in Q2, prior to foreign currency translation, driven by a 20% decline in same-store sales. This decline in same-store sales included a 26% decline at KFC and 7% growth at Pizza Hut casual dining.","Similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, China restaurant margins decreased significantly in the second quarter, down 5 percentage points versus prior year, driven by the operating deleverage you\u2019d expect with a double digit decline in same-store sales.","In addition, because Q2 is a seasonally low sales period in China, the deleverage impact on division operating profit, when viewed on a percentage basis, was even more pronounced due to the relatively fixed nature of G&A expenses. Bear in mind these P&L dynamics work in both directions, so as same-store sales rebound at KFC, we expect both margin and profit to benefit significantly from operating leverage.","On the development front in China, we opened 100 new units during the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. While this was low in comparison to the first quarter, this resulted from a concerted effort by team China to pull new unit openings into Q1 to benefit from peak seasonal sales during Chinese New Year.","For the first five months of the year, which comprised China\u2019s first and second quarters, we opened a total of 326 new units in China, which is more indicative of the run rate we expect balance of the year, and in line with our expectations of at least 700 new units in 2013. However, similar to previous years, new unit development in China will be heavily skewed to the fourth quarter.","Yum! Restaurants International reported an operating profit growth of 12%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The refranchising of our Pizza Hut U.K. dine-in business late last year benefited YRI\u2019s operating profit growth by 3% percentage points. I\u2019m especially pleased with YRI\u2019s rapid pace of new unit development, especially considering that of the 205 new units that YRI opened in the quarter, about 63% were in high growth, emerging markets.","Now as Rick mentioned, YRI\u2019s same-store sales grew 1% in the quarter. This was lower than expected, because similar to other retailers, we experienced soft performance in some developed markets. However, we\u2019re very pleased with the strong and broad-based growth we achieved in emerging markets. Restaurant margin increased 0.8 percentage points at YRI, largely due to the refranchising of our Pizza Hut U.K. dine-in business.","In the U.S., second quarter operating profit grew 4% versus prior year. This included a benefit of about 10 percentage points from the overlap of expenses incurred in Q2 of last year, related to the resolution of an employment lawsuit. Partially offsetting this, refranchising negatively impacted U.S. operating profit growth by about 3 percentage points.","Taco Bell again led the way in the U.S., delivering same-store sales growth of 2% in the quarter, successful overlapping last year\u2019s phenomenal 13%. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth at Taco Bell, demonstrating yet again that our combination of breakthrough innovation, compelling value, and operational excellence resonates with consumers. As Taco Bell represents about 60% of U.S. division operating profit, we\u2019re especially pleased to see these same results.","U.S. restaurant margin increased 0.8 percentage points, driven primarily by refranchising. As expected, our refranchising strategy is leading to more consistent results and is setting us up for even better returns in the years to come.","We\u2019re also pleased with the progress we continue to make with our U.S. development strategy, where we again expect to achieve net positive unit growth for the second consecutive year, led by our attractive investment models for Pizza Hut Delco Lite and Taco Bell.","Now I\u2019m going to talk about EPS expectations for the full year. To be clear, we\u2019re not changing our full year EPS estimate of a mid single digit percentage decline versus prior year. Additionally, consistent with our previous estimate, we expect that the 16% EPS decline in the second quarter will be our low point for the year.","Our full year EPS forecast is obviously heavily dependent on our sales and margin recovery in China, and we\u2019ve estimated sales based on the actual trends we\u2019ve observed. You\u2019ll recall that through the end of March, we were making progress toward recovering from the poultry supply incident that occurred in late December, when in early April, we began to be impacted by publicity surrounding reported cases of avian flu.","The negative impact of this publicity peaked in mid to late April. In early May, the number of newly reported avian flu cases began to fall off, and by the end of May, every province in China had lifted their emergency alerts related to avian flu. As a result, we began to see traffic rebound at KFC as reflected by the sequential improvements we reported in monthly KFC same-store sales since April, an 11 point improvement in May compared to April and a 12 point improvement in June compared to May.","This pattern is generally consistent with what we\u2019ve observed with past instances of avian flu in China, roughly equating to a 3-month wear off period. Based on this trend, as well as the sustained improvement in our underlying business, we continue to expect that China sales will recover throughout the year and be positive in the fourth quarter.","As we\u2019ve said before, the shape of these recoveries is difficult to predict, as no two issues are exactly the same. As previously committed, we will continue to keep you informed of our progress by temporarily providing monthly updates on our China same-store sales. Our next update will be for the month of July, which we will report on August 12, 2013, after market hours.","Now as David mentioned, results of Little Sheep have been soft, due in part to a lower than expected approval process and ownership transition, and our new unit development progress has also been slower than we anticipated. Additionally, negative publicity resulting from quality issues with other hot pot concepts in China has further impacted sales at Little Sheep, even though there never was an issue with the quality of Little Sheep products.","If this weak performance continues, we could be required to report a noncash special charge for the impairments of trademark, goodwill, and other assets later this year. We will continue to keep you posted on this.","Moving to our other international businesses, we expect another solid year of sales growth at YRI, driven by record new unit development of at least 1,000 stores in 2013. Additionally, we continue to expect a record 150 new units in India, representing over 20% growth in total store count. And in the U.S., we\u2019re expecting solid profit growth, driven by continued strength at Taco Bell.","So while our overall results for 2013 will be clouded by the temporary sales issues at KFC China, the balance of our portfolio is on track to deliver targeted growth. I will now share our preliminary thoughts on 2014.","Based on our assumption that China sales are positive in the fourth quarter, we expect to exit 2013 with upward momentum. In addition, as we enter 2014 we will have opened about 1,600 new units in China over a two-year period.","So with all of these units in the ground and operating, and assuming sales and margins recover as anticipated, we expect very strong growth in China operating profit in 2014. However, the magnitude of China\u2019s rebound next year will depend heavily on the shape of China\u2019s sales and margin recovery through the end of this year.","As I\u2019ve mentioned several times before, the timing and trajectory of these recoveries is difficult to forecast. What we do know, however, is that China\u2019s long term growth potential hasn\u2019t changed, and we are uniquely well-positioned to capitalize on two powerful demographic trends that favor retail development in China: Number one, rising income levels, and number two, a rapidly growing consuming class.","We also believe that our business models for YRI in the U.S. and India have never been better, which gives us the confidence to expect these businesses will deliver profit growth in 2014, consistent with our ongoing earnings model.","Adding it all up, we are confident that Yum! is poised for a strong bounce back in EPS in 2014, and we look forward to providing a more detailed perspective on this at our December 4 meeting in New York.","So to wrap things up, I have to say that I consider it a distinct privilege to be the CFO of a company that, even with the challenges in China, and how they\u2019ve weighed on our second quarter results, is committed to staying the course with its growth strategies. Importantly, we continue to make substantial investments behind these strategies because we believe in the durability of our growth model and the power and resilience of our brands.","And with that, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan ","Obviously when we talk about China, we talk a lot about the Yum-specific issues that have affected the first half of \u201913. But I was hoping we could maybe talk about the China macro. And to the best of your ability and your knowledge, can you separate what\u2019s happened specifically to you guys in chicken and talk about how the China macro may have potentially affected your rate of development and the development opportunities this year, pricing, and perhaps even overall traffic to western QSR. If there\u2019s any comments that you can make from a bigger picture perspective?","David Novak ","I think when we step back and we look at what\u2019s going on in China, and as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, I think the biggest thing we see going on in China continues to go on, and that\u2019s that the consuming class continues to grow. You know, it\u2019s 300 million today, it\u2019s expected to be 600 million people by 2020. And this is backed up from a number of different sources.","And as Pat just mentioned, we also see disposable income growing as well. The economy itself is growing 7%, which still makes it the fastest-growing economy in the world. So those are things that I think bode well for brands that are consumer-oriented.","When you look at just the infrastructure, what\u2019s going on in China, it continues to expand at a rapid rate. I think China\u2019s building over 90 airports, six of which will be at least as big as O\u2019Hare airport. Train stations are expanding, subway lines. All these really represent fantastic opportunities for our brand.","And you know, I think what\u2019s happening in China today is still unprecedented. It\u2019s the largest urbanization effort in the history of the world. And I think that Yum! Brands, and our position competitively, is stronger than any restaurant company in this world.","And I think what we\u2019re seeing, and Pizza Hut\u2019s great evidence of this, is that if you have innovation and you have value, and an economy like China has today, you can have very strong same-store sales growth and you can open up new units very profitably and move into lower-tier cities and expand very aggressively.","And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with Pizza Hut casual dining in spite of all the, I guess you could say, headwinds that might exist in the market. So at the end of the day, we continue to be very bullish on China. And when you look at the long term, we wouldn\u2019t trade places with anyone.","And I think that this country is going to continue to grow very rapidly, and we\u2019re seeing it today. There\u2019s a bit of a slowdown, but their slowdown is, I think, a pretty rapid rate when you compare it to what\u2019s going on everywhere else in the world.","So, again, you know, we find this to be true everywhere in the world. When you have powerful brands, you innovate, you provide everyday affordable value, you operate your business well with good service, you can win. So what we\u2019re focused on doing in China is continuing to innovate, continuing to work on our value equation, continue to upgrade our assets, continue to open into the new trade areas, because we think it\u2019s a winning proposition over the long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse ","Just to follow up on John\u2019s question a little bit, and maybe try to get a little bit more specific, when you think about, even if we\u2019re decelerating to what\u2019s still in absolute terms a great pace of growth for the economy, what could this do to that mid-teens wage inflation outlook you talked about? This quarter came in a little bit lighter. Is it still a mid-teens wage growth inflation outlook that you\u2019re looking for? Or could we end up seeing something slightly slower?","Pat Grismer ","Keith, you\u2019re right. We did see the inflation on labor moderate a bit in the quarter. But that was more due to some productivity initiatives that helped to mitigate what would have otherwise been a rate of inflation consistent with the guidance we provided, which over the long term is driven by what the government\u2019s policies are around driving an increase in disposable incomes, which continues to be in the mid-teens range.","Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse ","So then one follow up question. As we think about pricing and how fiscal \u201812\u2019s price increases kind of roll off mid third quarter, how do you think about your ability to raise pricing? In an environment, we just talked about that has fairly meaningful cost inflation, how do you think about - is it the macro factors that most influence this? Do you need to see traffic back to a certain level? Do you plan to take pricing? Anything around those plans for the back half and into next year would be very helpful.","Pat Grismer ","At present we have no new pricing actions planned. Our number one goal is to regain the traffic that we\u2019ve lost over the last few months, and we\u2019re confident we can do that based on the trends we\u2019ve seen to date. We know that it\u2019s important to provide consumers with innovation and compelling value, and so it\u2019s not our expectation that we would be taking more pricing later this year.","Now, obviously the situation is very different at Pizza Hut, where we remain in a position of significant strength with our brand. And we have taken some pricing this year, and consistent with our growth model for that business, we may take pricing later this year. But in the case of KFC, given where we\u2019re at today with the brand and our goal to rebuild the brand for the long term, we\u2019re not expecting to take additional pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer ","When I look at the store level margins for China, your labor cost deleverage was a lot less severe this quarter than Q1. So it looks like the cost control has obviously tightened. And I know you just talked about some labor productivity, but your same-store labor costs look like they were actually down over 8%.","So when we think about sales reramping, how important is it going to be for you guys to stress maybe some of the newfound cost controls you\u2019ve found, or some of the productivity initiatives you\u2019ve found, so that you can allow the operating leverage to really flex itself as those sales come back?","And you talked about operating leverage a little bit. Maybe other than the labor line, maybe you could point out some other sources of operating leverage as sales come back, and how we should think about the China margins.","Pat Grismer ","The operating leverage actually has a greater impact on our occupancy and other costs. We have a much higher component of fixed cost. We do get the operating leverage benefit on the labor line, though, that\u2019s true. But we do expect that the productivity initiatives that we\u2019ve put in place will sustain and will contribute to an improving margin over time. The single biggest lever as it relates to our path back to higher margins is first regaining the transactions that we\u2019ve lost, and beyond that to continue to build new sales layers. Because that\u2019s ultimately what allows us to leverage the fixed costs in our business.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer","And just a quick follow up. If you can talk about possibly the food cost dynamics in China right now and how your food cost outlook is shaping up.","Pat Grismer ","You may recall in New York what we had estimated for the China division for the full year was about 3% food cost inflation. Thankfully, due to favorable trends, primarily in chicken and cheese, we\u2019re now expecting food inflation to be about flat on the year. What we\u2019ve seen year to date is deflation. So we saw about 5% deflation in Q1, 3% deflation in Q2. We don\u2019t expect that deflationary trend to continue balance of year. We expect to land on roughly flat for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with JPMorgan.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","From Morgan Stanley. Could I ask, just following up on the, I understand about the labor productivity savings. That makes sense. But occupancy only grew 5% in U.S. dollars. And unit growth was 3X that rate. So is there a substantial variable piece to occupancy, and that\u2019s why that\u2019s occurring? What else would cause that line to decelerate so much from a growth perspective?","Pat Grismer ","Included in that line is rent and about half of our leases in China have a variable component. Also included in that line is advertising expense, which also tends to be variable.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","And was that particularly variable this quarter? In other words, did you reduce advertising spend this quarter?","Richard Carucci","John, we did take the advertising rate up just a bit in the quarter.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","So not down, up?","Richard Carucci ","That\u2019s correct.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","And then can you talk about G&A globally? There were some reductions that looked like, from a dollar perspective, some of it came from the U.S., year ago period comparison, but it feels like there was also maybe some reductions, both maybe at corporate and certainly in China. What were those? How sustainable are those? Are those just tied to compensation, or were they in other areas?","Richard Carucci ","Definitely there were some overlap issues I think we called out, but in terms of anything one time, I don\u2019t think there was really anything unusual in the quarter.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","And how material is Little Sheep? I understand there\u2019s maybe an impairment risk, but is there a risk that if these trends continue to be poor, that there\u2019s going to be some risk to the China margin that\u2019s material enough to call out, or there\u2019s some risk to earnings in the back half because of it?","Pat Grismer ","No, consistent with what we\u2019ve disclosed in the past, the operating results of Little Sheep are not material to the China division results today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs ","On the labor line in China, expenses grew 9% in the quarter, which is less than unit growth, despite some inflation. So obviously you were able to reduce hours, which I think you guys were calling productivity initiatives. Can you maybe be more specific? Where were you able to cut back on labor at the store level in China? And then how do we think about 2014? Are these efficiencies you\u2019ll be able to carry with you that you found in the business? Or are you going to have to flex labor hours back up when sales recover?","Pat Grismer ","There were actually two things going on with China labor in the quarter. The first is that because the adverse sales impact of the avian flu, publicity was more pronounced in Shanghai than in other parts of the country. And in Shanghai, as you know, we have some of the higher labor rates. The mix of our labor across the division benefited from that, and that contributed a bit to the labor favorability we saw in the quarter.","And then the second piece is around the team\u2019s ability to implement tighter controls around labor utilization and a more optimal mix of part time and full time employees.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs ","And then you guys talked about some catalysts for KFC China later this year, including new news on chicken. Can you give us just anything on what to expect there? I mean, are we talking step change type innovation? Anything you could share would be helpful.","David Novak ","I don\u2019t think I\u2019d characterize it as step change, but we think it\u2019s very solid. That\u2019s how we characterize it. And we really wouldn\u2019t want to go into detail on that in the call.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs ","And then maybe one last clarification. June same-store sales improved to minus 10, can you tell us anything about the compares so we understand the context of that figure, meaning was June last year weak disproportionately for any reason? Or is the improvement to minus 10 in June a clean, sequential improvement and indicative of the trajectory of their recovery?","Rick Carucci ","We\u2019ve made the judgment not to break out the quarters. We reported the quarterly comps last year, and we\u2019re going to continue to report the monthly numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research ","David, you mentioned the opportunity around transportation areas. I believe maybe some data was given at the analyst day in December. Could you just give us a sense of how many stores are near transportation hubs, and where you see that unit growth opportunity? It seems like that type of unit development might be a little less vulnerable to food safety related issues and perhaps macro-related shocks.","David Novak ","I\u2019d have to go back and get the exact number on that, but we can get back to you on that.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research ","And while I\u2019m on the line, if I could separate ask about YRI, in the emerging markets you had a very strong comps growth. Can you maybe give us a sense of where the strength was? Was it broad-based? Were there any areas of weakness? And within emerging markets, Africa has been talked about a lot, and maybe just long term, can you give us a sense of when you think Africa could start being a profit contributor?","Rick Carucci ","We highlighted on the call Russia and South Africa were the big drivers. If you talk about the impact of South Africa, you have to think of it as two pieces. South Africa right now has the lion\u2019s share of the business, so that\u2019s what\u2019s going to impact the current year\u2019s results. And so South Africa has been performing very well. Over time, the cumulative impact of it, as we enter these new African countries, will come into play, but it\u2019s probably not going to have a material impact on YRI\u2019s results for the next two or three years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Omohundro with Davenport Securities.","Jeff Omohundro - Davenport Securities","My question is regarding Taco Bell and the DLT rollout of Cool Ranch. Just wondering about the pacing of product, compared with nacho cheese. And when looking at the Flamas that\u2019s coming, what\u2019s your sense about the potential of this product versus Cool Ranch? And then lastly, on this same topic, this seems to me relatively rapid pacing of new flavors in this new sales layer. Just wondering how sustainable this model might be going forward in the longer term.","Rick Carucci ","Well, you know, I think consumers maybe wouldn\u2019t call it fast-paced. As soon as we launch nacho cheese Doritos, people got the joke and they were almost asking for Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos. So we actually had to wait a little longer than we would have liked to, just because the demand was so great on the nacho cheese. We couldn\u2019t get the supply we needed to launch the Cool Ranch.","I think we think of them both as separate flavors, but also part of a portfolio. So when you saw us launch the Cool Ranch, clearly we were trying to introduce the news, and a lot of our social media was oriented towards that. So we asked consumers, in fact our fans, to come out. And they were able to try it before we even advertised the product.","But when we advertised it, we also used the slogan \u201cCollect all two\u201d. We wanted to reinforce we still had the nacho cheese piece. So we look at that as a portfolio and we\u2019re looking at adding to that portfolio. We originally thought that would be early next year. We\u2019re still evaluating the timing of that. We could right now forward possibly a little bit into this year.","So we\u2019re excited about it, and I think that those will be the main three brands in terms of flavors. I think after that you\u2019ll probably see some more flavors, but they may be either in and out type of ideas. We\u2019re obviously very excited about the results we\u2019ve got as well as the future potential to add other flavors.","David Novak ","I think the only thing to add on that is that no one else has this. It\u2019s pretty nice when you have products that nobody will ever have but us. So it\u2019s a platform that is totally unique to Taco Bell, and so every time we advertise it, whether we have product news or not, we\u2019re advertising something that no one else has.","And, you know, as Rick said, we\u2019ve started out with two biggies. The two biggest Doritos flavors are nacho cheese and Cool Ranch. We\u2019ve hit on them. Flamas is obviously a much smaller segment. But it does give us an opportunity to come back and [pulse news].","I think the big thing about Doritos Locos Tacos is no one else has it.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ","I have a question on the longer term vision for the China margins and the type of recovery you\u2019re expecting. I think you\u2019ve talked about 20% margins longer term. I\u2019m just wondering what type of average unit volume you might need to see over the next couple of years to get back to that level. Is it just a matter of recapturing the sales that you\u2019ve lost over the last year or so? Or do you need to go beyond that to get back into the really high teens or close to 20%?","Pat Grismer ","You\u2019ll recall that prior to the onset of the poultry supplier incident in late December, we were at about 18%. So step one is to regain the traffic that we lost. And we therefore have a high degree of confidence that as that happens, we will return to that level. In terms of getting back to 20%, we still consider that an appropriate target for our business, because nothing structural has occurred to prevent that.","And so as we think about the drivers that are going to get us back to the 20% target, beyond regaining the transactions that we lost, and also benefitting from the recovery in average check, I would say there are three factors. The first is continuing to build sales layers. We\u2019ve been very successful at this over the years, introducing new day parts and new occasions that put us in a position to leverage our fixed costs.","The second is to continue to evolve our new unit development strategy. As we\u2019ve indicated before, we are shifting our new unit openings increasingly to lower-tier cities for KFC and more broadly to Pizza Hut casual dining, which is comfortably, today, above 20%. And so with those changes to our development program, we\u2019ll see a benefit that will get us closer to that target of 20%.","And the final piece is given the strength of our competitive position over time to take pricing where it makes sense. You probably recall that our ongoing earnings growth model for China requires mid single digit same-store sales growth in order to offset inflation and maintain our margins.","Based on the inflation that we\u2019ve experienced maybe over the last year and our decision not to take pricing, there will be a point in time where we may need to leverage the strength of our competitive position to take a bit more to get to the 20. I think it\u2019s fair to say that that is an appropriate target, but it will be very challenging to get to 20% in 2014.","But you know, make no mistake, we will have a high-margin business in China. It\u2019s difficult to say when we\u2019re going to hit that 20%, but you have to remember that we manage our brands for the long term. We\u2019re not chasing a 20% margin. We\u2019re not focused on getting there next year, for example.","We love our competitive position, and even with the 18% margins we had going into the supplier issue, we had three-year cash paybacks because we have such an exceptional asset turnover ratio. It\u2019s a powerful investment model for our shareholders, and we see extraordinary returns continuing at Pizza Hut. So we think the 20% is an appropriate target, and we have a path to get there over time.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ","And just one quick follow up on the step one of getting back towards that 18% figure. And given you\u2019ve absorbed some inflation this year, and you\u2019re likely to see some inflation next year, what type of rebound in the comps might you need to see next year to get back to that 18%? Or is that an unrealistic target for next year?","Pat Grismer ","Well, given where we\u2019re at in our recovery, and we are seeing those improving trends, it\u2019s premature to have such a detailed conversation around 2014. We continue to believe that we will see the strong bounce back. We\u2019ll provide a more detailed perspective, as we typically do, at our analyst conference in December. And at that time we can provide you more insight into the extent to which same-store sales and pricing and inflation will play into our margin recovery over the course of 2014.","The last thing I will say is that based on our past experience with these things, the recovery curve, or the recovery trend, is rarely linear. So, you know, it\u2019s just important to keep that in mind. We\u2019re giving you our best estimate. We reaffirmed that we expect the fourth quarter to be positive for China. And that will provide us the momentum that we need going into 2014 to see the strong bounce back next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.","Andy Barish - Jefferies","Just a couple of quick ones. On the promotional side of things, was wings something that you kind of brought on? Or was it in the plan to kind of go back to value? And then just secondly, on the overall China development, can you frame it with just kind of a broader perspective on the percentage of openings in kind of tiers three through six going forward versus sort of what it has been historically, I guess?","Pat Grismer ","Well, on the development front, we are continuing to shift. It\u2019s not something that changes dramatically overnight. But I can assure you that there are two key shifts occurring in our new unit development program. For KFC, moving increasingly to tier three and below cities and increasing significantly the number of Pizza Hut casual dining openings.","David Novak ","And as far as wings go, wings are very popular in China. And we promote them generally in the summer period. And so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s extraordinary, out of the realm of what we typically do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Just a couple of questions focused on this year if I could. The tax rate is coming in a little lower than what you guided to. Do you think that will be the case for the full year? Or are you thinking something less than 27% for the full year now?","Pat Grismer ","It\u2019s not uncommon for us to see some unevenness or volatility, if you will, from one quarter to the next. I think it\u2019s early at this stage to provide guidance that was different from what we provided in December, which was about 27% for the full year.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And then the wage rate inflation, what did it run this quarter? And you mentioned a mid-teen rate, but hasn\u2019t it been well below that so far this year? And would you expect it to remain below that?","Pat Grismer ","So we\u2019re talking specifically about China labor inflation. Q1 was in the mid teens range. Q2 was high single digits. In terms of where we\u2019re going to land on a full year basis, it could be in the high single digits to low double digit range. As I said before, when we look longer term, we continue to expense something in the mid teens range.","Operator","And your final question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ","Just two questions. One just a follow up on the China side. It seems like the recovery is going along the expected trajectory, but I\u2019m curious about the approach going forward. Pat, you mentioned the outlook for \u201914 is somewhat heavily dependent on the sales and margin recovery in \u201913. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk a little bit about value and the promotions you might be thinking about. Better still, if you want to talk specifically on that, is margin a focus at all? Or is it all about achieving the desired full sales recovery at all costs? And then I had a Taco Bell follow up.","Pat Grismer ","Well, it is premature to talk in any detail around 2014. We wanted to give you a sense for what we expect next year, which is the strong bounce back. Certainly value is an important element of any brand strategy, along with breakthrough innovation, and our plan is to continue to offer both.","David Novak ","We never go after a recovery at any cost. We run a business. We\u2019ve got a business to run, and we want to have a long term, sustainable business model and brand proposition. So we\u2019re basically running the business the way we think it ought to be run, so that we\u2019re relevant to customers on a continual basis. And we\u2019re not doing anything that\u2019s overly dramatic.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ","And just a follow up on the Taco Bell. I know in your prepared remarks you mentioned the breakfast rollout. I guess it\u2019s on track for \u201914. Any color you can give in terms of the sales lift you were getting in test, or the potential impact of the comp, or any impact that might have had on the core lunch and dinner business? Any color around breakfast relative to lunch and dinner and what contribution that could make?","Rick Carucci ","Not really at this stage. We may know a little bit more. We\u2019re sort of dialing up some of our product ideas and advertising for later this year, and at that point we may have a better read for what exactly could happen.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ","But in test is there any color around the sales mix or the profit contribution or anything like that?","Rick Carucci ","The sales mix has been around the 4% range, but this is before we\u2019ve now dialed it up. So like I said we have plans to dial it up in the fall, and once we dial it up, both advertising and adjusting our product line, we may have a better read.","David Novak ","Okay, since there aren\u2019t any more questions, let me wrap this up by just saying that this was a slug it out quarter for Yum! Brands on our way to recovery in China. While our second quarter EPS declined 16%, it was generally in line with our expectations.","The good news is that KFC China sales are recovering as expected. At Yum! Restaurants International in our India division we expect record unit development this year, and our new unit pipeline has never been stronger. Our estimated mid single digit full year EPS decline versus prior year remains unchanged.","And importantly, we expect a strong bounce back year in 2014 as we continue to aggressively invest behind our core strategies and capitalize on the enormous growth opportunities we see around the world. We continually say we\u2019re on the ground floor of global growth, and that continues to be the case.","Steve Schmitt","Thank you very much. Appreciate it."],"22685":["YUM!

All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.","In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum!

Our April same-store sales release for our China division will be May 10, after market hours.  Our Taco Bell investor analyst conference will be May 21 in Irvine, California.  And our second quarter earnings release will be Wednesday, July 10.  ","On our call today is David Novak, Chairman and CEO; Rick Carucci, President; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. Following remarks from each, we will take your questions.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Novak.","David Novak ","Thank you Steve, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call.  While better than expected, the first quarter was extremely difficult for Yum! Brands.  As anticipated, intense media attention surrounding poultry supply in China significantly impacted KFC\u2019s sales and profits.  Earnings per share declined 8% versus prior year, as our China division operating profit fell 41%.  Operating profit increased 19% at Yum! Restaurants International and 5% in our U.S. business.  ","While we\u2019re certainly not happy with our overall results, as we look at how our China sales evolved through March, we were making progress and it was pretty close to where we thought we\u2019d be.  Unfortunately, our quest for a full sales recovery has been dampened by the intense publicity of avian flu in China, beginning in early April.","Now the last time we were significantly impacted by avian flu was in 2005.  The sales impact was initially dramatic at KFC, but relatively short lived, lasting about three months.  We anticipate this will once again be the case, but there\u2019s no way to be certain.  ","Based on our results through the first three weeks of April, we expect China division same-store sales will be down about 30% for the month.  You will see the actual numbers in our sales release scheduled for May 10.","Putting the avian flu situation aside, I\u2019d like to share some of what the team in China is doing to restore consumer trust in the KFC brand and to enhance our industry leading supply chain practices.  Immediately after the Chinese New Year, in late February, we launched what we\u2019re calling Operation Thunder.  To the Chinese consumer, this signifies swift, decisive action, which is exactly what we\u2019re doing to address consumer perceptions related to the safety of our chicken in China.","As part of this initiative, we announced several enhancements we\u2019re making to our supply chain.  One specific enhancement was to work with our suppliers to eliminate over 1,000 small and less modern chicken houses, where risk could be the highest.  We want our suppliers to only work with the most sophisticated chicken farms in China.","We also launched an aggressive quality assurance program including 30-second television commercials.  Our strategy is to build as much awareness as possible of our industry leading quality assurance processes.  Our research indicates the more people hear about what we\u2019re doing, the more willing they are to come back into our restaurants.","Additionally, we are continuing to build the KFC brand with major news around value and innovation.  Our goal is to come out of this stronger than ever on our food safety perceptions in China and get sales back on track as fast as possible.  ","These are certainly trying times for our KFC China business, but I want to be crystal clear that we do expect a complete sales recovery.  In previous years, we have faced SARS, Sudan Red, and previous avian flu situations, and in every case, we have bounced back.  And when sales do come back, we\u2019re going to benefit from the additional 1,600 restaurants we\u2019ll have built during 2012 and 2013.","We have a world-class team, an unmatched distribution system, and industry-leading advertising resources.  KFC is a powerful and resilient brand that is loved throughout China.  We expect to bounce back stronger than ever.","We think staying the course on at least 700 new units is the right number, recognizing we are still out-developing competition by a wide margin, still have first mover advantage by entering over 100 new cities, and have no urgency to expand more rapidly in the current environment.  And remember, this means we will open about 1,600 new units in two years.  There\u2019s no question we are continuing to capitalize on the number one retail opportunity in the world.  ","As I have mentioned before, the most positive new news in recent years at Yum! is the incredible performance of Pizza Hut casual dining in China.  We continue to have less than three year cash paybacks, and are successfully expanding across lower tier cities.  While sales started a bit slow in the first quarter, we are pleased that March same-store sales grew 4%.  We have major product news with [Stone Fan Steak] this year, and we\u2019re beginning to expand breakfast into more cities.  We\u2019re very bullish on pizza and casual dining this year, and in the years to come.  ","Overall in China, we\u2019re going to stay the course with our strategy to have leading brands in every significant category.  We will continue to build our two big brands, KFC and Pizza Hut casual dining, and we will continue to invest in pizza at home service, Little Sheep, East Dawning, and we opened 226 new units in our first quarter and are well on our way to open at least 700 restaurants this year, which again, we believe is a very good number.  ","Outside of China, we expect solid on-target performance for Yum! Brands, and as I evaluate our strategies, I\u2019ve concluded that just like China, we have the right strategies in place, and the best thing we can do for our shareholders is to stay the course with what we\u2019ve been focusing on.  We\u2019re very focused to be the emerging market leader in the restaurant category, and positioned for growth in so many countries around the world.","At Yum! Restaurants International, we\u2019re going to continue with our strategy to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere.  Our new unit pipeline has never been stronger.  We expect to open over 950 new restaurants this year, and grow operating profit consistent with our ongoing growth model of at least 10%.","And I\u2019m very pleased that our U.S. business will be a net new unit developer for the second consecutive year.  Importantly, Taco Bell, which represents about 60% of our U.S. profit, had a strong first quarter and continues to have success building on its Doritos Locos Tacos and Cantina Bell platforms.  We expect our U.S. profits to grow in line with our ongoing growth model of 5%.  Finally, we\u2019re investing and developing a great business in India, which will drive substantial future growth for Yum!  ","So to wrap this up, 2013 is obviously going to be a difficult year for Yum! Brands due to our challenges with KFC in China.  Our Yum! Restaurants International and U.S. businesses are well-positioned to deliver against our growth targets and drive future growth for years to come.","I\u2019m confident that our China business will bounce back strongly and lead the way to restoring our track record of consistently delivering double digit EPS growth in 2014, 2015, and beyond.","Now Rick Carucci will take you through our strategies for Yum! Restaurants International and the U.S. business.","Richard Carucci  ","Thank you, David.  Good morning everyone.  At Yum! Restaurants International, our strategy remains to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere.  What I would like to do today is review the nature of our growth.  ","The growth from YRI continues to be driven by our franchisees and our strength in emerging markets.  In 2013, you will see that our equity presence in select emerging markets will also contribute to this growth.  ","One characteristic that we love about YRI is the recurring and growing nature of its franchise fees.  These franchise fees will approach nearly $1 billion in 2013, which represents 10% growth versus 2012.  Our franchisees are investing heavily behind our KFC and Pizza Hut brands and are aggressively building new units.","During the first quarter, we developed 147 new units, and 90% of these units were opened by franchisees.  We continue our rapid pace of expansion throughout the year, and expect to set a record by building over 950 new units in 2013.","This franchise growth provides a large cash stream for Yum!  It also generates significant value for our shareholders.  We believe that the capital free franchise business at YRI is unique, given that it provides income and cash that is large, growing, global, and diversified.  ","We\u2019re delighted to be meeting with over 500 of these franchisees, representing over 100 countries, at our upcoming biannual franchise convention in Beijing, where we will discuss our strategies and initiatives.  We look forward to working together with our franchisees to develop even more profitable growth opportunities in the years ahead.  ","As we have said before, Yum! is the clear leader in emerging markets.  70% of the new YRI units in the first quarter were in emerging markets.  The bulk of the emerging market business will continue to be led by franchisees.  ","However, over the last few years, we have also developed a company-owned presence in some select high-growth countries.  These include Russia, South Africa, and Turkey.  Three years ago, we had no company-owned restaurants in these markets.  Today we now have about 230 company units.    ","We are bullish on all three of these markets.  Over the past two years, Russia has led our entire system in same-store sales growth.  This continues to be the case so far in 2013, where Russia posted system sales growth of 45% in the most recent quarter, driven by development and same-store sales growth of 25%.  We have been able to step up new unit development this year and we are encouraged by the initial returns we are getting on our new company-owned stores.  ","In the continent of Africa, we are also expanding aggressively.  We are building off an established base of about 700 stores in South Africa, where we are the clear market leader.  Africa is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, and with over 1 billion people throughout the continent, it represents a tremendous long term growth opportunity.  ","We completed the acquisition of our Turkey business earlier this month.  Turkey is a fast-developing country of about 75 million people.  With only about 60 KFC and 45 Pizza Hut restaurants, there\u2019s no question that we have a huge potential for growth there.  We\u2019ve already ramped up development and expect to open about 25 new restaurants this year. ","Our acquisitions in these three countries advance our strategy to increase ownership in high-growth, high-return businesses.  I want to emphasize that we believe our company ownership is helping to accelerate growth.  In 2010, we had a total of 63 new units in these three countries combined.  This year, we expect to add over 170 units, and about 50 of those will be company-owned.","It is likely that the new unit builds in these countries will continue to grow.  The combination of aggressive franchise growth and an equity presence in select countries should help us extend our lead in emerging markets.  We are generating strong growth, and believe we can do so for a long, long time.  ","As a reminder, Yum! currently has around 2 restaurants per million people in the world\u2019s 10 largest emerging markets.  Assuming we maintain our current pace of development, we\u2019d have only about 4 restaurants per million people in these markets by the year 2020.  That compares to 58 restaurants per million in the U.S. today.","Overall, Yum! Restaurants International business is on track for another solid year in 2013.  Clearly, we have a long runway for growth at YRI.  Now on to our U.S. business.","Before I get into the U.S. business performance, it is interesting to note that the U.S. business has a royalty stream in excess of $800 million.  Therefore, when you put YRI and the U.S. together, they\u2019ll produce about $1.8 billion of franchise revenue in 2013.  That\u2019s almost double what we produced as a company 10 years ago.","While our U.S. business is beginning to development net new units, it is more reliant on growing same-store sales for its growth.  In our category, you grow same-store sales by offering strong value and introducing innovative new products.  ","In the past year, I don\u2019t think anyone has done a better job of innovation than Taco Bell.  Taco Bell grew same-store sales by 6% in the quarter, and that\u2019s on top of 6% growth in the first quarter last year.  ","We\u2019re now in the midst of launching Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos.  Our new marketing campaign, Live Mas, is resonating well with consumers, and the brand is generating lots of excitement in social media.  We expect to sell about 100 million Doritos Locos Tacos during the second quarter, and this continues to be one of the most successful new product launches in our history.  ","As we look at the balance of the year, we believe that we have strong product offerings.  Because these are backed by solid operations and increased media rates, we believe that Taco Bell is well-positioned to have another successful year in 2013.","Pizza Hut and KFC sales in the U.S. during the first quarter were softer than we would have liked.  In this environment, you win by providing compelling value and innovation.  In hindsight, some of our competitors did a better job of this than we did.  We expect to fare better for the balance of the year, and we are particularly excited about the recent launch of KFC\u2019s original recipe boneless chicken.","We are continuing to add net new units at both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  The Pizza Hut Delco Lite format is generating excitement among our franchisees and is allowing us to add more units in small town America.  ","Taco Bell is following Pizza Hut\u2019s lead, and is also going after more rural new units.  Taco Bell is again adding net units in 2013, and the combination of a new, smaller building asset design and a franchisee rural incentive should lead us to even more net unit growth and openings in 2014.  When we look at the U.S. we are building the foundation for a business that we believe will provide better and more consistent performance.  ","To sum it up, while China is clearly experiencing a challenging year, the rest of Yum! is performing pretty well.  We believe we are well-positioned for the future, and these divisions are on track to achieve our full year growth targets for 2013.","Now let me hand things over to our CFO, Patrick Grismer.","Patrick Grismer ","Thank you, Rick.  As you heard from David and Rick, Yum! Restaurants International and our U.S. division are delivering solid results, yet we obviously have our challenges in China.  We continue to see this as a temporary setback, and remain as bullish as ever on our long term growth prospects.","As evidence of that, we are continuing to invest in the future.  With these investments, and given the demonstrated growth potential of our businesses, I\u2019m very confident that our track record of double digit EPS growth will be restored in the years to come.","I\u2019ll now provide some additional perspective on our first quarter results and share our EPS outlook for the second quarter and full year.  For the first quarter, we recorded an 8% decline in EPS before special items, which was significantly better than the 25% decline that we had previously estimated.  This better than expected result was primarily driven by stronger than expected sales in China during the Chinese New Year holiday period in February.","Now I\u2019ll share some performance highlights for each major division.  In China, operating profit declined 41% in the first quarter, prior to foreign currency translation, driven by a 20% drop in same-store sales.  With a sales decline of this magnitude, China restaurant margin was severely impacted, down 7 percentage points versus prior year.  Bear in mind, this dynamic works in both directions, so as our China sales recover, we expect a similar rebound in restaurant margin.","On the development front, China had an exceptional quarter, opening 226 new restaurants, or nearly 4 per day.  With Chinese New Year following relatively late in the quarter this year, our world-class China development team was very intentional about pulling units forward into the first quarter to benefit from peak seasonal sales.","Yum! Restaurants International reported operating profit growth of 19% in the first quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.  We benefited from a major franchise ownership change this quarter, which added transfer and renewal fees, as well as from changes to an overseas pension plan.   ","These items added 8 percentage points of operating profit growth to YRI\u2019s overall performance.  And, as expected, refranchising the Pizza Hut U.K. dine-in business late last year benefited YRI\u2019s operating profit growth by another 3 percentage points.","Adjusting for these items, YRI\u2019s core business delivered about 8% operating profit growth this quarter.  Importantly, YRI continued to drive impressive unit growth, opening 147 new restaurants in the quarter, including 103 new units in emerging markets.  Same-store sales grew 1%, which was softer than expected, as weak results in Japan and Western Europe adversely impacted YRI\u2019s same-store sales by about 2 percentage points.  ","However, we experienced strong same-store sales growth in our equity-led emerging market businesses in Russia, South Africa, and Thailand, and we\u2019re pleased with the sustained improvement of our KFC Australia business.  Restaurant margin increased 1.4 percentage points at YRI, largely due to the refranchising of or Pizza Hut U.K. dine-in business.","Moving to the U.S., first quarter operating profit grew 5% versus prior year.  Excluding the impact of refranchising, operating profit grew a very respectable 7%.  This performance was led by Taco Bell, which had an outstanding quarter with 6% same-store sales growth and restaurant margin improvement of 2.4 percentage points.","It\u2019s clear that our customers love both nacho cheese and now Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos.  And without a doubt, Taco Bell is a leading performer in the category.  In fact, this marks the fourth consecutive quarter that Taco Bell has outperformed the category, demonstrating the positive momentum we have as a powerful brand that represents about 60% of our U.S. profit.  And while sales at Pizza Hut and KFC fell below our expectations in Q1, their profits were more or less on plan.  ","For the U.S. division overall, restaurant margin increased 2.4 percentage points in the first quarter, including 1.3 percentage points from refranchising.  Importantly, this marked the fifth consecutive quarter of year over year margin gains in the U.S.","And finally, speaking of U.S. refranchising, we continue to make good progress with our program, which we expect will be substantially completed by the end of this year, bringing our franchise ownership in the U.S. to over 90%.  This ownership strategy, along with our improved unit-level economics, positions the U.S. for more consistent profit growth in the years ahead.","Now I\u2019ll turn to EPS expectations for the second quarter and full year.  As you know, the most sensitive variable in this year\u2019s profit forecast is China same-store sales, so I\u2019ll start with that.  As disclosed in our 8-K filing on April 10, March same-store sales declined 13% in our China business, with KFC same-store sales declining 16% and Pizza Hut casual dining same-store sales growing 4%.","As David mentioned, we continue to expect the sales recovery will take time.  However, the recent publicity on avian flu will add even more choppiness to that recovery, weighing particularly heavily on second quarter results.  ","Based on our results through the first three weeks of April, we expect China division same-store sales to decline about 30% for the month, with KFC significantly negative and Pizza Hut casual dining positive.  Prior instances of avian flu have been short lived at KFC, and with this as our assumption, we believe our overall recovery will be no different from our previous estimate, with China division same-store sales turning positive during the fourth quarter.  We will continue to temporarily provide monthly updates on same-store sales in China, and we\u2019ll report April sales on May 10, 2013, after market hours.  ","Despite the start of our recovery from the China poultry supply situations that occurred in late December, and with the unexpected impact of avian flu publicity that started in April, we are forecasting a significant double digit EPS decline for Yum! in Q2 and expect this to be the low point of our year by far.","As for the full year, our EPS expectations are essentially unchanged at this stage.  We are holding our full year forecast at a mid single digit decline because of the risk of avian flu publicity added to our China sales recovery.  Essentially, we are estimating that all of the EPS upside we saw in the first quarter versus our earlier estimate will be offset in the second quarter due to the impact of avian flu.","That said, I want to emphasize that it is extremely difficult to forecast sales or profits in China right now.  This was already a challenging proposition, and the recent emergence of avian flu has only added to the uncertainty.","Despite our short term setback in KFC China, our long term growth model is still intact, driven by new unit development, same-store sales growth, and high returns on investment.  The good thing about our business is we are a cash generating machine.  Even with this year\u2019s disappointing EPS results, we expect free cash flow well over $2 billion, which includes a franchise royalty stream of nearly $2 billion.  ","We also remain committed to using our operating cash flow to invest behind the growth we see in our business, with over $1 billion of capital expectations expected this year, while returning all remaining cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Our investment in new unit development is skewed towards high growth emerging markets such as China, India, Russia, and Africa, and these development opportunities remain very robust.  We continue to believe that China is the number-one retail growth opportunity in the world, and continue to forecast at least 700 new units there this year.","Given the pace of development we achieved in the first quarter, we expect our new units in China to be more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year, and we expect this intense pace to ease balance of year.","As always, we approach our China development with extreme rigor, and will continue to monitor new unit performance and adjust our expansion plans as appropriate.  We also expect to open at least 150 new units in India this year, with over half of these being KFCs, thereby growing our KFC store base by over 30% versus prior year.","At YRI, we expect to build over 950 units, including 80 units in Africa, 60 units in Russia, and 50 units in Thailand.  And finally, driven by the irresistible returns of our Pizza Hut Delco Lite and the improved economics of our Taco Bell units, we expect the U.S. will be net unit positive again in 2013.","In summary, 2013 is shaping up to be a very challenging year for Yum!, and while we take account of these results, we view this year as an aberration that neither erases our track record of performance nor diminishes the growth opportunity that we are uniquely well-positioned to capture.  I\u2019m confident that we will bounce back strongly and regain our status as a double digit growth company in the years ahead.","And now we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Your first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein ","I just wanted to talk a little bit about your China recovery cadence.  I think historically you said the avian flu has been very short in its impact.  Just want to sort of get a sense of if you look back at \u201905, are we talking about a month, or two months?  Or kind of what the overall cadence is?  ","And then also, on the same, related topic, it looks like you managed margins very, very well in China, so maybe can you just talk a little bit about what kind of variable expenses are there in payroll and occupancy that allowed you to hold margins that well given the negative costs in the quarter?  ","Patrick Grismer ","With respect to to the impact of avian flu, when we look back at how this has impacted our business in the past, what we have seen is a sharp impact initially that then diminishes over a period of about three months.  So we\u2019re expecting about the same recovery period this year.  And so just to reinforce then, in terms of our overall sales recovery, what we are currently estimating is a 6-9 month recovery period, with same-store sales in China turning positive in the fourth quarter.","And then with respect to your question on margin, there were obviously a number of moving pieces here.  The most significant variable in that equation is transactions.  And so the transactions did hit us significantly in the first quarter, and as that reverses, it will certainly work to our advantage over the course of the rest of the year.","With respect to the composition of our restaurant costs and the variable components, there is a fair amount of variability in rent expense where many of our units have a variable rent component, as well as the fact that a portion of our labor expense is variable.  And also, keep in mind that advertising, which runs about 4% of sales, is also nearly entirely variable.  And so that gives us some ability to mitigate the impact of the transaction deleverage.  ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.  ","John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan","Also staying on China if I may, and a few different topics.  Firstly, obviously first quarter development was exceptional, especially for a two-month quarter, and I think David, for emphasis, a few times you said you expect 700 for the year.  So I guess at this point, trying to get a sense whether the avian flu and the December price [unintelligible], kind of having you back off the development maybe, at least as I\u2019m interpreting, maybe slightly, especially relative to prior years?  You know, if there are other issues that we should be sensitive to?","And then the second question, if I may, is on gross margins in China, or cost of goods sold looked at inversely, that was very, very low.  The COGS was very low in the quarter, and some may have interpreted that you would invest in gross margins to kind of really sell the value message to consumers, whether now or at some point in the future.  So just wanted to get a sense of how you may use the COGS line or gross margins to invest to get back traffic when the time is right.","David Novak  ","Well, I think, first of all, on the development, we think that staying the course on the number that we provided at the analyst conference back in December was that we said we\u2019d open at least 700 units.  We still think that\u2019s the right number.","I think the reason why we believe it\u2019s the right number and we\u2019re staying on it is that we\u2019re still out developing competition by a wide margin, as I said, we still have that first mover advantage that we\u2019re opening up in 100 new cities this year.  So we don\u2019t really see any urgency to expand more rapidly in this current environment.","I think the China team has always been given the charge that this is a business that\u2019s a jewel.  Polish that jewel, keep making it as strong as you can.  And we\u2019ve never ever forced or challenged the team to grow at a faster rate than it ought to, and I think as we look at the year, and where we\u2019re at, we just think that we\u2019re going to make the prudent and the right decisions as we go forward.  And that number will be at least 700 restaurants, so that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re looking at that.","In terms of investment in the value proposition, we have great cost structure.  We\u2019ve always done what\u2019s right for the customer.  We have a number of value initiatives planned, even with this current challenging environment.  ","And what I expect, given everything that\u2019s going on, the launch of Operation Thunder, with the quality assurance campaign that we\u2019ve launched, we\u2019ve got some significant innovation coming, value promotions going, we expect to go into 2014 with KFC being stronger than ever.  And that\u2019s our goal.  ","This is obviously a challenging time, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you just can\u2019t keep investing and building the brand and setting yourself up for the future.  And we love our positioning with KFC in China over the long term.  ","Patrick Grismer ","And John, to build on David\u2019s comments on the cost of sales and the implications for our margin, in the first quarter, we were fortunate enough to experience food cost deflation of 5%, and we had a 3-point benefit of pricing from actions taken last year.  So a rollover pricing benefit, if you will, of 3 points.  ","Those two elements combined helped to blunt the impact the transaction deleverage on our overall margins, and help to keep our cost of sales percentage in a good spot, despite the fact that as you say, we were offering more value during the quarter to help support more transaction growth.  ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.  ","David Palmer - UBS","I know it\u2019s probably tough to tease this out, but has the talk about antibiotics died down?  Is your team\u2019s perception that as we get past the avian flu issue, that you\u2019re going to be in another level with antibiotics, and maybe there\u2019s even, crazy as it sounds, a silver lining to the avian flu issue in that it\u2019s sort of wiped clean or perhaps permanently pushed back into the back of people\u2019s consciousness, the whole antibiotics issue that was at the fore a few months ago?","David Novak ","I think what we\u2019re pleased with is the publicity on the poultry issue has really subsided, and we\u2019re moving more into the process and continued process of building consumer confidence.  I think basically what we need in China is just to get the time that we\u2019ve seen historically has brought our business back.  And that\u2019s really the way we\u2019re looking at it.   ","I wouldn\u2019t even comment on your hypothesis.  I\u2019ll leave that to you.  What we think we need is really the gift of time to build consumer trust back and keep building the brand forward as we move ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bank of America ","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Two questions.  One back on the China margins.  Can you walk through what\u2019s happening with labor inflation?  And obviously labor costs up year over year, but with a little better control than I might have guessed.  And just kind of curious if the wage inflation has subsided any.","Patrick Grismer ","With respect to China labor inflation in total, at the restaurant level, we experienced about 14% inflation, more or less in line with our expectations.  The wage rate component of that was up 8%.  So the difference reflects growth in the cost of employee benefits and growth in the cost of management labor.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And then with all the poultry issues and supply chain changes, how does this affect you looking out to 2014 and beyond from a cost standpoint?  And then as you continue to grow, is the poultry industry capable of growing with you?","Richard Carucci ","At present, we don\u2019t expect the increased rigor of supply chain management practices is going to have a material effect on our poultry supply costs.  In fact, we have reason to believe that flock yields could improve as a result of some of these more stringent practices and that will help to diminish the cost of any new procedures that may be put in place at our suppliers to continue to drive even higher levels of quality.  ","And then in terms of longer term supply, we remain confident that the larger producers will continue to grow and meet our supply requirements.  So we\u2019re not concerned that we\u2019re going to face a situation where we\u2019re going to be supply constrained in a way that is going to put upward pressure on poultry costs.  ","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And then just going back to the China labor thing for a moment, if I look at labor costs per store, they\u2019re very flat year over year.  So is that just adjusting to the lower level of business, staffing-wise?  Or is there something else that would drive that given the inflation numbers?","Richard Carucci ","No.  What I can tell you is that clearly in the current environment the team is very much focused on running as efficiently as possible, but because we do see this as a temporary situation, we\u2019re not taking actions that would in any way compromise the service that we\u2019re providing our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.  ","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to come back to this notion of it will take time to get through this, and that\u2019s probably true in this situation, but it won\u2019t necessarily prevent the next episode, and it will inevitably be something else.  ","So there are two issues in China that seemed to be needing to be addressed longer term.  One is your supply chain.  And what I\u2019m seeing is that chicken production in China is more fragmented.  It\u2019s not vertically integrated like it is in the U.S.  So on that first point, is there an opportunity to help suppliers vertically integrate in China so you don\u2019t see uncertainty.  Maybe it\u2019s using a multinational company, for example, as a key supplier.  Where do you stand on that?  ","And secondly is response to rumors.  It seems like you\u2019ve been caught off guard a few times in terms of rumors, and social media has exacerbated this.  Has there been a seismic shift, or has there been a change in the way you\u2019re choosing to respond to rumors more quickly or more effectively?","David Novak ","First of all, what I think we\u2019ve done on the supply chain is we\u2019ve taken swift, decisive action to work with our suppliers to get an even more enhanced supply chain system.  As I talked about earlier, we\u2019ve eliminated over a thousand chicken houses from our supply chain.  To your point, we are working with our suppliers to support the integrated farming system, developing best practices, working with them very closely.  ","And as far as social media goes, we have beefed up our social media monitoring system dramatically.  So I think our intention as a consumer company is to be best-in-class in this arena, and I think that\u2019s happening across the board in all of our divisions.  It\u2019s the number one priority of Jonathan [Blum], our public affairs officer, and we are very, very focused on this, and I think doing an excellent job.  ","In fact, being world class in social media, digital, is a major strategic objective of ours, and last week we just spent, as a team, a couple of days visiting places like Twitter and Square, just to get totally on top of what\u2019s going on in the world today.  Which I think we are.  ","But at any rate, I think we\u2019re taking all the actions we need to take to ensure that our industry leading supply chain is even better as we go into the future.  We do everything we can to be on top of social media and use it as an advantage, and be able to counter any false claims that come about.  And I think we\u2019re on top of both of these issues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.  ","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","","You guys are assuming a return to positive same-store sales before the year\u2019s out, and it makes sense, given prior similar incidents recovered at that pace, but how do you know that this time there hasn\u2019t been more permanent or maybe just semi-permanent damage to the KFC brand in China?  Is there something you\u2019re seeing specifically that gives you confidence?  Or is it just relying on the historical analogues?","Richard Carucci ","I would say the fact that we have seen sales start to come back in February and March, as David had said, about where we expected, gives us confidence that this recovery period of six to nine months is a reasonable expectation.  Before the recent publicity of avian flu, we were seeing the recovery, and we continue to expect, therefore, that a full recovery will happen in that six to nine month period, particularly given the fact that we expect this dramatic impact of avian flu will persist for only about three months or so.  ","We\u2019ve weathered many storms like this, so we do have a number of data points to inform our point of view at this point in time.  And again, based on what we saw happen over the course of Q1, and as we reported our March sales, which as you know, for our China division, fall into Q2, we remain confident that we\u2019re looking at a six to nine month sales recovery period.  ","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs ","And then on a similar kind of a point, you guys have presented your brand tracking scores in China over the last several years.  Can you tell us what you\u2019re seeing in the latest read from the consumer in your brand tracking?  What parts of your score have fallen off the most versus what\u2019s holding up?","David Novak ","I think we\u2019d have to get back to you on those specific numbers, and maybe share them on the next call if you\u2019d like.  I think one of the things that we are tracking is as we build awareness of everything that we\u2019re doing with Operation Thunder is just improving consumer perceptions and the answer is the more people are aware of what we\u2019re doing, the better they feel about coming back into our business.  And so I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to track.  ","But without question, we have a beloved brand with KFC.  And as you know, when you have great brands, you just have to keep doing the things that build a great brand, and you come back.  Every great brand comes back, and KFC is in a powerful position.  And whatever issues there are in the category, or with food safety, or whatever, we\u2019re top of the class in terms of being a brand that people can rely on.  So I think that\u2019s what gives us so much confidence, as we go into the future.  We know we\u2019re doing the right thing.","I think the big message we have for Yum! Brands this year is staying the course.  We have growth staring us in the face all around the world.  Everywhere we look, we see growth opportunities.  We are the leader in emerging markets, not just China.  We\u2019re continuing to build our brands the right way.  And we have growth opportunity that is unparalleled.  Even as we look at China.  You\u2019ve got 300 million consumers, they\u2019re going to 600 million.  And you know, we see this as the number one retail opportunity in the world.  ","Nothing has really changed from last year, other than the fact that we have a challenge that we have to work through, and we\u2019ve worked through these challenges in the past, and we\u2019re not only doing it with KFC right now, we also are building Pizza Hut.  Pizza Hut, as I mentioned, is the biggest new news at Yum! Brands.  We\u2019re opening up in new cities with three-year cash on cash returns.  We are definitely going to have the leading brands in every significant category.   ","And then, as you were listening to the call, look at what\u2019s going on in the United States.  We\u2019ve improved our margins for five consecutive quarters.  Taco Bell, which is 60% of our profits, is looking more and more like a power brand.  I don\u2019t think anybody is doing a better job of marketing or innovating than Taco Bell.  ","And so we really think we\u2019re doing the things that really set this business up for the long term.  Our margins improved at YRI.  Why?  Because we\u2019ve restructured the business, we\u2019ve refranchised our U.K. business.  ","So all of this sets us up for the future.  2013, for all of our shareholders out there, I want you to know it\u2019s very disappointing to us.  We\u2019ve got a track record we love, but we want to get it back, and we want to come back in 2014 stronger than ever. ","And every sign I see, as I talk to our people around the world, and I see what\u2019s going on, is that we\u2019re putting things in place to make sure that we continue to get back on that track record, and that\u2019s the goal.  Because we deliver, and we\u2019re going to deliver consistently over the long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.  ","Brian Bittner \u2013 Oppenheimer","I\u2019d love to talk about something else, but I\u2019m actually going to ask about China.","David Novak ","That\u2019s all right.  It\u2019s a big opportunity for us.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer ","You know, this must be tough to really answer, but I\u2019m going to ask it anyway.  You know, based on the trends that you\u2019re seeing throughout April, I think this avian flu thing really, I think the first press release or whatever came out about March 31, so it\u2019s been about three and a half, four weeks.  It\u2019s subsided a little bit, but not a lot.  ","But based on the trends you\u2019re seeing throughout the month, do you think April represents a bottom, down 30%, and you start the recovery from there?  Or based on what you\u2019ve seen historically and based on what you\u2019re seeing in April, could it worsen in May?  Or could it be as bad in May?  Or do we start the recovery from this April number?   ","Richard Carucci ","Certainly we hope this is the low point.  It\u2019s very difficult to predict the exact trajectory of a sales impact like avian flu.  So it\u2019s tough to call at this stage.  But, again, based on our past experience with incidents like this, we believe that impact will go away in about three months.","David Novak ","You\u2019re right.  You\u2019re asking sort of like the mother of god question.  Nobody knows the answer to this one.  But no two crises are the same.  We can only look back.  But we\u2019ve weathered other storms in the past.  ","And to put this in context, the last time the China business was significantly impacted by avian flu was 2005.  Our China division operating profit was $200 million.  And at that point, it declined about 6% versus the prior year.  Last year we made over a billion dollars, and I think that\u2019s a real testament to just the power and resilience of the brand.  ","So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the next few quarters, two months.  Your guess is as good as mine.  I\u2019m not a soothsayer.  I\u2019m not a predictor on these kinds of things.  So we\u2019ll just watch the press coverage, we\u2019ll pay attention to what\u2019s going on, but most importantly, we\u2019re going to continue to build the value, and build the brand, and build the innovation that we know is going to set us up for the long term.  ","So I can\u2019t really call exactly what\u2019s going to happen in the next two to three months.  I don\u2019t think anybody can.  What we can tell you is that this is a dramatic impact on our business.  It\u2019s short lived, and the period, in the past, has been about three months.  ","Richard Carucci ","And we are continuing to take actions, as we have in the past, to remind consumers that fully cooked chicken is perfectly safe to eat, and we\u2019re reminding them, in several different ways in store and television, and so forth.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer ","I appreciate the answer.  And then another quick follow up, just on the margins.  I think you said deflation of 5% in the quarter, 3% pricing.  What are we thinking for kind of a full year effect as far as food cost inflation or deflation and a full year pricing impact so we can think about food margins going forward?","","Patrick Grismer","At this stage, we have no reason to move off of the full year guidance we\u2019ve provided at our December analyst conference, which for food costs is low single digits, and for labor, mid teens inflation.  So we would stick to that as a full year expectation.  As it relates to what our reported margin is, I\u2019m not going to speak to what that number is going to be or what it might look like in any given quarter.  ","There are so many different moving pieces here, as I\u2019m sure you can appreciate.  The biggest lever for us is transactions.  And so we\u2019ve taken a big hit on transactions.  We expect those transactions will come back.  So the deleverage impact that we\u2019ve experienced thus far will reverse as those sales come back, and that\u2019s going to be the biggest driver of our margin performance balance of year.  ","We do have some rollover pricing benefit, which benefited us in the first quarter.  That will continue to have some impact, albeit a bit less, in the second and third quarter, but at this stage, I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s appropriate to provide a full year number on margin or certainly not to talk about what\u2019s going to happen in Q2 versus Q3.  ","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer ","Got it.  But just to be clear, what\u2019s happened so far has not really changed the food cost inflation trajectory?  You still expect back half inflation?  ","Patrick Grismer ","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA.   ","Diane Geissler - CLSA","I have another question on China, and this really relates to the whole issue of food safety.  China has had a number of scares in a variety of industries, including dairy and hog raising, and I guess my question is really have you seen any movement on the part of the Chinese government to change regulations and\/or make it easier for the big integrated processors to expand?  ","You\u2019ve talked about culling from your system the small house operations, but have there been any shifts in terms of biosecurity from the government?  Or helping multinationals site houses, whether that\u2019s through better land use rights, negotiations, etc.?  Just in terms of how you see that supply chain going forward over the next five, 10, 15 years?  ","David Novak ","I think the biggest thing with the new government in China, new regime, is food safety is high on their priorities.  So I expect there to be more diligence and more work with major companies like ourselves.  As the leader, we see our task as setting the standard, and that we plan to work, and are working, very closely with the government to do everything we can to be the leader in food Safeway.  But I think it\u2019s really too early to talk about any seismic changes that are occurring.  But I do believe that the food safety will become even better and more enhanced over the long term given everything that\u2019s going on and the focus of the government.","Diane Geissler - CLSA ","And then just on real estate, do you see any shifts in terms of development and your ability to site new stores this year and into 2014?","Richard Carucci ","No material change that we see.  As we\u2019ve said before, our new unit development program is shifting increasingly to the lower tier cities where the development opportunities are more compelling, margins higher, returns higher, and we\u2019re also shifting more from KFC to the Pizza Hut brand.  And that will continue.  In terms of our ability to secure the sites and the development of infrastructure to create the opportunities for us, we don\u2019t see that changing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse","","Just one more question on China.  Thinking through the long term company restaurant margin outlook, 20% has been a number that you\u2019ve offered for some time.  2011, 2012, and now 2013 all below this.  We\u2019ve added in the Little Sheep concept, which has slightly lower margins.  Is this still the right long term target?  Is that what you\u2019re planning for?  Is this something that a return to positive comps can help you achieve?  Or is this now a multiyear process to get back to that target given the acute challenges of this year?","Richard Carucci ","We continue to believe that 20% margins are imminently achievable with our China business, and it\u2019s not just comps that are going to get us there.  Certainly in the short term, the transaction recovery is going to be the single biggest driver of margin improvement.  No doubt about it.  However, there are a couple of other things to keep in mind.  ","The first is ongoing asset leverage as we continue to add new layers to our business, to our existing restaurants.  Whether it\u2019s 24-hour operations in our KFC business or breakfast at Pizza Hut, these new sales layers are going to better leverage the existing investment we have and provide that leverage on fixed cost.  ","And then the other is the impact of portfolio shift.  As I mentioned, when we look at our new unit development program going forward, for the KFC brand we are continuing to shift from the tier one and tier two coastal cities to the tier two inland and tier three and below cities, where margins are significantly higher and we are continuing to shift more of our new unit program from KFC to Pizza Hut.  ","And I want to point out, even though this wasn\u2019t in our release, that even in a quarter where same-store sales were down for our Pizza Hut casual dining business, margins were still well above 20%, and even close to 30% in the lower tier cities.  This is going to be an increasing focus of our development program going forward, and that\u2019s going to benefit the portfolio restaurant margin for our China business. ","So I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind those three factors.  It\u2019s transaction recovery, it\u2019s ongoing asset leverage as we introduce new sales layers, and it\u2019s a shift in our development program and how that\u2019s going to benefit portfolio margins.   ","Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse ","One very quick follow up, if I can.  Thinking through Little Sheep now, which you\u2019ve basically anniversaried since the acquisition, is this at the point now where regardless of all this other noise, can Little Sheep be a tailwind to that margin curve this year maybe, and over the next couple of years as well?  ","Richard Carucci ","I think it\u2019s premature to say that it\u2019s going to be a margin tailwind this year.  But our long term expectations of the growth that we will get out of that business to be high.  It is a relatively small portion of our portfolio today, but we didn\u2019t buy it, as you know, for the 400-500 units that are in the ground, but for the several hundred units that we know we will build over the next several years.  And with the improvements that we are bringing to the concept and our operations knowhow, we are optimistic that the margins are going to improve significantly.  And at that stage, with a larger scale business, and much better margin performance, then the Little Sheep business will be helpful to our overall margin.","David Novak ","Little Sheep is very small at this stage, but we expect it to get a hell of a lot better.  We\u2019re improving the concept every which way we can, so there\u2019s only upside.  But, you know, it\u2019s not a big tailwind for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.  ","David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W.

I know you don\u2019t want to give any guidance at this point, or specific guidance at this point, but I was just wondering if you think 2014 could be a big rebound year in terms of the earnings growth given the expected sales recovery in China?  So for example, soft year in 2013, followed by a well above average year in \u201914?  And by the time you get to 2015 maybe you\u2019re back on your long run trend line?  Just any thoughts on how you think it might play out would be helpful.","Richard Carucci ","I think you\u2019re thinking about it exactly the right way.  Let me tell you, if 2014 is not a big bounce back year, we will all be very disappointed, because that is our expectation.  We have a high degree of confidence that is going to be the case.  And as I said in my remarks earlier, 2013 is an aberration.  ","So I wouldn\u2019t spend too much time focusing on 2013 results.  Not to suggest that we\u2019re not focused on doing the best job possible, but as it relates to how you think about our business, and what we\u2019re going to deliver, and how we\u2019re set up to continue to grow, I encourage you to continue to focus on 2014.  We do expect that we will begin to see a strong recovery next year.","David Novak ","Our great and late chairman Andy Pearson had a great line.  He said the best way to have a great year is to follow up a bad one.  Well, we clearly have a bad one this year, and so we expect next year to be very, very good, and we have very high expectations for ourselves.  I think the important thing for our investors to know is that we\u2019re building the platforms that we think will establish the long term growth.  ","If you take Taco Bell for example, we are really leading in terms of improving our quality, innovation with what we\u2019ve done with Frito Lay and the Doritos Locos Tacos line.  We have world class operations.  We\u2019ve been focusing on that for some time, but we\u2019re ranked in the top three across every key measure in operations that we look at.  We\u2019re building it for the long term.","At Pizza Hut, we\u2019ve got good value proposition, good innovation.  We\u2019re working on a major platform in chicken, where we can really develop our sales as we go forward.  Across the board, we\u2019re working on the sales layers, the breakfasts and beverages and things that we think will give us the incremental sales that will be significant over the long term.  ","So what we\u2019re focused on this year is staying the course and building a sustainable growth engine for the long term.  And nobody expects us to grow at least 10% next year.  We expect to do a lot better.  ","Patrick Grismer ","And the other important point to reiterate, David mentioned this in his remarks earlier, is the impact of the new unit development in China.  So last year we opened about 900.  This year we\u2019re saying at least 700, so that\u2019s 1,600 between the two years combined.  Collectively, that will deliver about $2 billion of system sales, which represents about a 25% increase on the base.  ","So think about it.  As we recover from the effects of this late December incident and the more recent avian flu publicity, we have all these new assets on the ground generating sales and profits that will contribute significantly to our growth in 2014.","David Novak ","But the proof\u2019s in the pudding, you know?  I mean, you can look at this and you can see all kinds of potential, but as my father used to tell me, potential means you haven\u2019t done it yet.  So we\u2019ve got to turn around China, we\u2019ve got to keep building these businesses, and then I think the businesses will end up being where they ought to be.  And this is a growth company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.   ","Andy Barish - Jefferies","Two quick YRI questions.  On the avian flu, do you expect a little bit of impact in some of your other Asian markets?  And then just a clarification on the Pizza Hut U.K. franchise renewals.  The deal closed in the fourth quarter, but the renewal fees and new franchise stuff came in in the first quarter?","Patrick Grismer ","I\u2019ll respond to that piece first.  The franchise ownership transfer, with the transfer fees and the renewal, wasn\u2019t related to the Pizza Hut U.K. business.  It related to a different market for us, where there was a transfer in ownership from one franchisee to another.  That happened in YRI\u2019s first quarter.","Richard Carucci ","Regarding impact of avian flu, I don\u2019t think what\u2019s happened in China is going to impact other markets.  I think what will happen is if that appears in those markets.  We\u2019re obviously going to keep a close eye on that.  We\u2019re prepared in advance to communicate what our response would be, which is what people have said here before, which is properly cooked chicken is perfectly safe to eat.  So we\u2019re ready for the possibility, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have an impact unless it hits other countries.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.  ","Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research","I\u2019ll try to avoid the China questions.  It seems like we\u2019ve gotten a lot of different angles on that.  Although I\u2019m sure there\u2019s probably some more.  But just on the balance sheet, there wasn\u2019t a lot of share repurchase in the quarter.  And you are, I think, under 1x levered.  Could you maybe just discuss if there are any constraints to using the balance sheet a little more aggressively in general, and using share repurchase in particular?","Patrick Grismer ","We continue to take a look at this, and we\u2019re quite happy with where things are at right now.  We\u2019re generating enough cash to pay the meaningful dividend and return remaining cash to share repurchases at a level that will accomplish what we expect as it relates to contribution to earnings per share growth.  We\u2019re not interested in leveraging up at this stage and putting at risk our investment grade credit rating.  We believe we\u2019re in the sweet spot as it relates to how we balance these things out and the implications for our overall cost of capital.  So no plans to do what you\u2019ve suggested.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research ","And separately, just on the second quarter, I think you mentioned down double digit.  Obviously that\u2019s a wide range.  Maybe any more particular range, obviously that could be down 10% or down 30%.  Any incremental info on how to model the second quarter would be helpful.","And does the very weak second quarter results on tap, obviously it\u2019s China driven, but does some of it relate to the very typical comparison at Taco Bell?","Patrick Grismer ","No.  Certainly Taco Bell was not playing into how we\u2019ve characterized EPS results in Q2.  What we\u2019ve said is that it will be a significant double digit decline.  By far our low point of the year.  But because we delivered so much better results in the first quarter, that puts us in a position to cover the unexpected severe impact of avian flu on second quarter results and thus hold to our full year estimate of mid single digit down.  ","And just given that the wildcard here is China sales recovery, which is very difficult to call, I don\u2019t think it makes sense to give a more precise estimate of what that second quarter will be.  But we want everyone to know that it will be a significant double digit decline.  ","Richard Carucci ","And regarding the overlap of Taco Bell from a sales perspective, it is a huge overlap, as you point out.  As I said on my speech, we grew 6% in the first quarter on top of 6% last year.  And the second quarter Taco Bell last year had 13% same-store sales growth, which is obviously a huge number.  We look at it as anything positive being a really good result there.  And what the team has put in place, in the launch of Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos, I think we have a decent chance of accomplishing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West of Deutsche Bank.  ","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","","Just a bigger picture question on China.  We have seen a bit of a continued deceleration in GDP growth and retail sales growth in that market.  I was just wondering how that plays into your longer term thinking on unit growth.  And does it really matter if GDP is up 7 or 10, or do you have just so much room in the smaller cities that it really doesn\u2019t play into your growth algorithm at all?","David Novak ","We see the biggest macro is the growing consumer class, growing from 300 million to 600 million.  So let\u2019s say it grows from 300 to 550 or 300 to 500, it\u2019s still a lot.  And we\u2019ve got lots of upside as we go forward.  So that\u2019s the big macro that we look at, the growing consumer class and growing disposable income.  We think both those things will be moving in our direction and that\u2019s the key.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Omohundro with Davenport and Company.  "," ","Jeff Omohundro - Davenport and Company","Just wanted to expand a little bit on the Taco Bell momentum that you referenced.  I was just wondering if you could maybe address the Cool Ranch DLT launch with regard to mix shift and just how it compared with the original DLT launch.  Again, particularly since you\u2019re overlapping such challenging prior year comparisons.  ","Richard Carucci ","When Doritos Locos Tacos was launched in 2012, with nacho cheese, the peak mix was about 11-12%.  And when it was [off air] sort of towards the end of the year, beginning of this year, it got down to about 4%.  So we left it on the menu, but we weren\u2019t promoting it for a period of time.  When we relaunched Cool Ranch, we got about that same level of mix, about 11-12% of mix.","David Novak ","That\u2019s a huge number for Taco Bell.  Anything over 3% is big.  If you haven\u2019t tried it yet, you ought to.  If you like Doritos, you can\u2019t eat just one.  Try the boneless chicken at KFC too while you\u2019re at it.  That\u2019s really good.  Then if you need another meal, go have cheesy crust pizza.  ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.  "," ","Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays","Two follow up questions.  One on China.  I know you talked about the complete confidence and the full sales recovery.  Obviously some of these issues have been compounded, which makes teasing it out somewhat difficult.  I think most people agree that the supplier issue and the avian flu issue will ease with time, and you have history for that.  ","But any thoughts on, I know we had seen a slowdown in trend in October, November, December, which was talked about at your analyst day.  I know it was tough to kind of look at it.  At that point in time, there was some debate whether average check had gotten too high, or whether there was too much price.  ","I\u2019m just wondering how you think about what gives you the confidence in the full sales recovery, or what would you see that would make you more cautious that maybe the initial issue back in the fourth quarter of \u201912 might be more severe than you might have thought.  And I had a follow up.  ","David Novak ","I think we know that we\u2019re constantly improving our value equation, constantly building awareness of the sales layers we have, with delivery and 24-hour service, and breakfast.  So we\u2019ve got things that we\u2019ve invested in to give us a base that we can build on.  And we think it\u2019s early days.  ","I mean, we\u2019re not capacity constrained.  It\u2019s not like we can\u2019t make more chicken, sell more products, and build our day parts.  Our average unit volumes are $1.7 million to $1.8 million at KFC and Pizza Hut.  The average unit volumes for McDonald\u2019s is $2.6 million in the United States.  So we think that one of the ways McDonald\u2019s got there is they kept building those incremental day parts over time.  ","And that\u2019s what we think we clearly have the opportunity, as we move ahead.  And I think that\u2019s just fundamentally, when you look at our asset base, and how we can leverage it, that gives us a lot of confidence.  These are very untapped day parts that we\u2019re just in the early days on.  So I think that\u2019s the biggest opportunity.","Patrick Grismer ","The other thing that\u2019s going to help is if you look at the quarters balance of year, the last are the less challenging, if you will, and certainly that\u2019s going to contribute to our ability to deliver improving results balance of year on the underlying business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.  ","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","Just again staying away from the China discussion, just looking for a little additional color.  I think you said 240 basis points increase in the U.S. restaurant margin.  Looks like you called out Taco Bell sales leverage and some refranchising as drivers.  But what was the approximate margin benefit from each of those things?  And I guess more importantly, as you look out to 2013 full year U.S. margin, what type of guidance can you give us for that?","Patrick Grismer ","What we saw in Q1 we expect to be about what we\u2019ll see for the full year.  The impact of refranchising was about half of the margin improvement we saw in the U.S. in the first quarter.","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo ","And that carries through to all four quarters?","Patrick Grismer ","There will be some variability from quarter to quarter, but on a full year basis we expect to see about 17% margin for the U.S.","Steve Schmitt","I think that\u2019s our last question for the day.

Yum! Brands delivered second quarter core operating profit growth of 7% and EPS growth, excluding special items of 9%. Given our strong first-half results and current trends in China, I'm pleased to raise our full-year core operating profit growth forecast to at least 14% from 12% previously. I'm particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum at KFC China which delivered better-than-expected same-store sales growth of 3%. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth at KFC China despite the second quarter being our most difficult of the year from a historical sales overlap standpoint. Importantly, our China Division is off to a good start in the third quarter for both KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining, including a return to positive same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in recent weeks.","Outside of China, challenging industry conditions in the U.S. contributed to soft sales results. However, our three brand divisions in the aggregate delivered core operating profit growth largely in line with our expectations and remain on track to deliver against their full-year core operating profit growth targets. We're confident in our plans to drive second-half sales improvement led by a continuous focus on innovation, value and our core products. This is a transformational year for our Company as we remain on track to finalize the separation of our China business with a targeted completion date around October 31, 2016, ultimately creating two powerful independent focus-growth companies.","Our capital structure is fully in place and we plan to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders both prior to and after the spin. And I look forward to sharing additional details on the transformative initiatives we're undertaking as we become a more heavily franchised Company at our New York investor conference on Tuesday, October 11. Today I will give you an overview of each of our operating divisions and then David Gibbs, our CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that the team and I will be happy to take any questions you might have. ","So first, China, as I mentioned, I'm particularly pleased KFC which represents about 75% of our operating profit in China, reported its fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth with 3% comps in the second quarter. This was driven by stronger results in the second half of the quarter as our bucket-related promotions resonated with consumers. It's great to see the team's focus on the core end value translating into tangible results. Furthermore, we've simplified menus, improved efficiency and conveyed our value proposition to customers all the while maintaining our consumer perception scores. In fact, we've done all this while simultaneously improving restaurant margins in each of the last four quarters versus prior year.","I'm also encouraged by KFC China's plans for the balance of the year and am pleased to report our third quarter which began June 1 and is historically our highest from a profitability standpoint, is off to a great start with same-store sales results quarter to date up low double digits. We rolled out Box Meals in June and are currently promoting our historically successful wing bucket which we pulled forward a week earlier this year. As you all know, Box Meals have proven effective globally for KFC and we expect success in China given test results. It's great to see knowhow sharing across our global knowledge base and we look forward to leveraging this on an ongoing basis across all of Yum!.","At Pizza Hut Casual Dining, system sales declined 2% and same-store sales declined 11% in the quarter. The good news is based on our third quarter results to date, it appears the China team's strategic initiatives are beginning to bear fruit. As evidence, quarter-to-date same-store sales are slightly negative and I'm pleased to report they have turned positive in recent weeks. Our renewed focus on pizza and ensuring customers understand our value proposition are critical to brand success. It's too early to declare victory but we know the potential of this brand and are further enhancing our core, simplifying the menu and leveraging ideas from Indonesia and Hong Kong, where we have other successful casual dining concepts to execute on our strategy. ","Overall we're clearly pleased with the progress we're making in China and our third quarter results to date. We caution overlaps do get tougher though for the balance of the quarter. So now onto our three branded divisions, in our KFC Division, same-store sales grew 2% in the second quarter or 4% on a two-year stack. Operating profit grew 6% in the quarter and the division opened 132 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 88% of these units were opened by franchisees and 68% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets, as I think this really speaks to the global strength of our brand. In the U.S. for example, we reported our eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth.","As further evidence we're gaining traction with our strategy in the U.S., our two-year same-store sales growth lapped 3% growth in the prior year, so on a two-year basis, comps were plus 5%. System sales in international developed markets grew 4% and in international emerging markets grew 10%. We remain on track to open at least 475 net new international restaurants this year and the U.S. is committed to delivering about 1000 remodels in 2016. After the spinoff of our China Division, KFC will be the largest contributor to new Yum! from multiple perspectives including absolute profit growth, restaurant count and profit growth to name a few what really excites me are all the opportunities for growth that exist for this brand.","Today we open approximately three new KFCs a day globally or one every 8 hours, we're on a path over time to open one every 5 hours which would nearly double our annual new unit openings. Pizza Hut had flat same-store sales in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth in the U.S. which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. While second quarter results in the U.S. were softer than expected as competitors responded to our first quarter success with more aggressive promotions, we're pleased to see transaction growth in the U.S. and a continuation of the positive sales trends in our U.S. business.","We believe our focus on making it easier to get a better pizza, whether it be by providing consistent value through the $5 Flavor Menu and $6.99 ANY Medium Pairs Deal or by improvements in technology as we upgrade our web experience and migrate our system to one POS will continue to enhance our business model. As a testament to our strategy, our Company-owned stores which are executing against a comprehensive suite of easy and better initiatives including a locally competitive value message driven by data science that is complementary to the national message and new operations programs geared to accelerate improvements in customer satisfaction, delivered second quarter same-store sales growth higher than the system with transaction growth more than five percentage points higher.","This Company outperformance is obviously encouraging as it is a clear indication that we're on the right track and we're excited about the impact these initiatives will ultimately have on the entire Pizza Hut system. Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were strong in Thailand, Canada and the UK but offset by weaknesses in Korea. Last quarter I mentioned that we were planning on rolling out proven, successful tactics in the U.S. in international markets. I'm pleased to say that we have started this and are seeing success with the $5 Flavor Menu in Australia and other markets and have plans to roll this construct out to additional markets later this year. This gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut business is not far behind the U.S. in its turnaround.","And finally, Taco Bell, operating profit grew 1% when adjusting for the impact of refranchise and this was after lapping a plus 29% from the prior year. However, U.S. same-store sales declined 1% as we left a plus 6% from the prior year. While a plus 5% on a two-year stack is ahead of the category, we expect more out of Taco Bell given the strength of this brand. In the current environment, we need to pair innovation with value that clearly resonates with our consumers. For example, our $5 Cravings Deal bundle improved results toward the end of the second quarter and through the first five weeks of the third quarter, same-store sales are positive. We believe that the Taco Bell brand is extremely well-positioned to exceed in a challenging environment.","In market research, Taco Bell always ranks as one of the top brands in providing value and innovation to consumers. We plan to leverage this decisioning in the balance of 2016 and going forward. Furthermore, we remain on plan with new unit development for the year. We're accelerating international new unit openings and are excited to see momentum behind this strategic objective. While it is early days, we believe this could be a meaningful driver of long term growth and look forward to continued progress. Now before I turn it over to David Gibbs, I just wanted to share with you some of the highlights from our recent biannual franchise convention that was held this year in Las Vegas. I think it's fair to say our franchisees are extremely bullish about the transformation we're undergoing at Yum! as evidenced by a record 1100 attendees representing over 100 countries, including numerous participants from our China Division.","This showcased the power of Yum! at its finest as we brought all three brands together to build and share know-how on development, advertising, innovation, value and digital. We're on a clear path to become a world-class franchisor and an even sharper brand builder. So as I said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We're confident we will deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth and I'm pleased with the momentum in our China business as we near completion of the China separation. The Yum! China team is excited to reap the benefits of a continued growth in the consuming class and as an independent Company, Yum! China will continue to unlock massive growth opportunities while further capitalizing on what remains the number one retail opportunity in the world.","At new Yum!, I couldn't be more excited about the plans we have to become an even more unique and more powerful world-class franchisor. We will not undergo an evolution from Yum! as you know it but instead another transformation as we increase our franchise mix to at least 96% by the end of 2017 and sharpen our focus on four key areas, brand building, franchisee capability, market and asset development and our unique culture. We will make all decisions based on this construct. We will transform our mindset from equity-led to franchise-led and commit to a cost structure that enables us to build on these pillars. And I look forward to sharing additional details of this transformed vision for new Yum! at our investor conference in October.","And with that, I will hand it over to David Gibbs.","David Gibbs","Thank you, Greg and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I will cover three areas, our second quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business. Let's start with a high-level overview of our second quarter performance. Yum! Brands delivered core operating profit growth of 7% in the quarter. Our China Division reported flat same-store sales growth despite it being our toughest compare of the year. As Greg said, we're pleased with the progress we're making in China and with sales results to date in the third quarter which is historically the biggest quarter of the year from a profitability standpoint.","Second quarter core operating profit in our China Division grew 6% and was impacted, as expected, by an additional $14 million enclosures and impairment expense versus prior year as well as a $4 million expense related to our RGM convention. These expenses were partially offset by a benefit from recent value added tax reform in China which went into effect on May 1 and positively impacted restaurant margins in the second quarter. In aggregate, our three brand divisions delivered 3% core operating profit growth in the quarter. This was led by 7% growth at Pizza Hut and 6% growth at KFC partially offset by soft results at Taco Bell. ","Overall, EPS before special items grew 9% including a 4 point negative impact from foreign currency changes. The EPS benefited from a 6% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our second quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. Now I would like to discuss our 2016 outlook. Given our strong first-half performance and current trends in China, we're raising our core operating profit growth forecast for Yum! from 12% to at least 14% including the 53rd week.","We started the year by saying that we expected Yum! core operating profit growth of at least 10%. Outside of China, our three brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial targets. Therefore, the increase in Yum!'s 2016 guidance is essentially due to upside in China including strong year-to-date KFC sales, margin and profit growth and a balance of the year that will be aided by the VAT change partially offset by a return to commodity inflation and higher labor costs.","As you might recall, last quarter we walked through the pending changes to China's retail tax structure which became effective May 1. As a reminder, under this reform, a 6% output VAT replaces a 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT is creditable to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. We believe this change will have a material benefit to Yum! China Restaurant margins for the balance of the year. However, the scale and nature of the policy along with implementation and transition challenges, make it very difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact. While we won't provide any further detail on VAT today, we expect to be able to provide more clarity on our third quarter call after we have a full quarter of results behind us.","I want to point out that for the balance of the year we do expect labor and commodity inflation to partially offset this benefit. With this and our first-half outperformance in mind, our current guidance for full-year China restaurant margins is now at least 17% versus 16% previously. Outside of China, our three brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. We expect any potential softness in top line performance to be offset by a favorable commodities environment. That being said, we're confident in our plans to drive sales improvement balance of year and are encouraged with our positive results third quarter to date at Taco Bell. ","On the development front, we added over 370 new units globally in the second quarter, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to over 650 units. Consistent with prior years the development will be weighted more towards the second half as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. In China, we have increased our focus on refurbishing and remodeling stores this year and we believe the momentum that we're seeing in the business today can be partially attributed to this investment in improving the guest experience. In fact, we're reallocating our capital to increase our pace of remodels to nearly 800 in 2016, up from our previous target of 550.","At the same time, we're reducing both our gross and net new unit numbers for the year by around 50 to 100 openings versus our original expectations. This is primarily due to fewer new Pizza Hut Casual Dining units this year. But to be clear, our confidence level in the long term growth prospects of our brands in China remains undiminished. Also keep in mind as a division, we expect about 100 fewer closures in 2016 than we had last year and we continue to get cash paybacks for new KFC and Pizza Hut units in the three- to four-year range, both great signs of the underlying strength in the business model and the potential for future expansion. And finally outside of China, for the full year we expect another strong year of development with total gross openings of nearly 1,800 units.","Turning now to foreign exchange, given the recent vote by the UK to exit the EU, I want to remind investors that one of the many great benefits of Yum! is our global and therefore diversified presence. In 2015, approximately 6% of our operating profit was generated from the UK and approximately 2% from the remaining Eurozone. That being said, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most of the world's other major foreign currencies, at current forward rates, currency translation is now estimated to negatively impact balance-of-the-year operating profit by about $50 million which represents an increase of $10 million versus our initial expectations.","As always, please take this as directional guidance only as rates will inevitably change as we move throughout the year. In addition, keep in mind this does not impact our core operating profit growth forecast of at least 14% which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation.","Now I would like to provide you with an update on our refranchising targets. As you know in connection with the China separation, we've committed to become at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. In the past four quarters, we re-franchised over 300 restaurants outside of China, including 82 units in the second quarter. Re-franchising will, simply put, improve our business model. Proceeds from re-franchising enable us to return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders while creating an even larger and more stable stream of franchise fees. It also produces immediate G&A savings as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. That being said, we realize there are additional opportunities to operate more efficiently and look forward to sharing more detailed plans around our ongoing re-franchising strategy and G&A roadmap at our investor conference on October 11.","Now I would like to quickly update you on our spinoff plans. We remain on track to complete the spinoff with a targeted completion date around October 31. We filed our initial Form 10 on May 3 and filed an amendment earlier this week. Our comprehensive global road shows will follow our investor conference. In conjunction with our spinoff, we're also optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. To this end, I'm very pleased to report the successful completion of our planned recapitalization in June.","In aggregate, we closed on $6.9 billion of new debt consisting of a $2.3 billion financing facility, securitizing our Taco Bell U.S. royalties; a $2.5 billion senior secured credit facility; and a $2.1 billion of high-yield notes. With the completion of our recapitalization, today we have approximately $9 billion in debt outstanding at an attractive blended interest rate of less than 5%. This marks yet another milestone in our previously communicated commitment to return $6.2 billion of capital, excluding ongoing dividend payment, to shareholders. In fact, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have repurchased $3.3 billion of shares which equates to $3.3 billion of shares which equates to 42.9 million shares at an average price of $0.70.","We continue to believe that our stock represents a good value at current prices. But make no mistake, this is just the beginning as we target an additional $3.5 billion in capital return across 2017 and 2018. This will take our total capital return program, including dividends, to $10 billion over about a three-year period and further demonstrates our commitment to delivering meaningful cash returns to our shareholders. So let me wrap things up. We're confident we will deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth for the full year and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business.","Our brand businesses are performing in the aggregate in line with our initial expectations and I'm pleased with the progress we're making in China as it approaches its first day as independent company. As Greg said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We look forward to sharing additional details with you at our New York investor conference in October.","And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Joseph Buckley","A couple of questions, could you elaborate a little bit further on the Pizza Hut Casual Dining opening plans that I think you mentioned you scaled back? And then are the remodels, the increased number of remodels in China, concentrated on Pizza Hut? Is that the capital trade off you are making?","Micky Pant","This is Micky. Pizza Hut Casual Dining, as you probably remember in 2015, we opened 280 units and over the last four years, we virtually doubled the estate. And we saw the trend over the last year of same-store sales and our judgment was that we should pause for a bit, so we will still build. We will be the leading developer of casual dining restaurants by far in China, but we paused for a bit. I think we're encouraged by the trend that we're seeing currently when same-store sales come back to positive territory and we will re-step up the build rate of Pizza Hut Casual Dining. ","As far as refurbishment is concerned, that is applicable to both our brands and it was our judgment that it was very important to improve the customer experience and also to be able to bring our estate in line with retail in China which has been modernizing in general very rapidly.","So we've, as David Gibbs mentioned in his comments, we increased our remodel rate across both brands and in aggregate that will be about 800 this year, so we've effectively, in the last 18 months, doubled our rate of refurbishment to bring the estate to acceptable levels. So it's not as though we're reinvesting only in Pizza Hut. We're reinvesting in both the brands. I hope that answers your question.","Joseph Buckley","It does.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John Ivankoe","I'm just going to try to sneak in a two-parter on China, if I may. Firstly and thank you for the color on the quarter to date basis regarding trends, but in the third quarter last year it was really a tale of I think two very different quarters where I think the first seven weeks was down 11 and then the next four weeks was up 31. So you guys kind of get to see the trends and normally I wouldn't ask you to forecast results for the rest of the quarter. But how might that significant change in trend between the first quarter and the second quarter perhaps influence the quarter-to-date numbers that you are talking about? Then I have a follow-up as well.","Greg Creed","I think we're not going to forecast obviously the balance of the quarter and I think as we said, we're pleased with the way the quarter has opened, whether that be in obviously China on both KFC and Pizza Hut or whether in the U.S. where we've actually seen Taco Bell sales turn positive. So I think we're excited by the positive momentum we've got. We do know and we spoke about the fact that, obviously as you said, the lap gets harder. But I do see some encouraging signs in the progress we're making in a number of the businesses around the world.","John Ivankoe","And then secondly, our calculation is never perfect for this, but we do look at new unit volumes in China the best that we can based on what you all report and it does look like first-half new unit volumes in China are well off average and well off what the trend has been. So I guess I wanted you to confirm or deny that and make some comments about the overall trend of new-unit volumes in China as you continue to develop both brands.","David Gibbs","John, I can give you a couple of technical points on that and then Micky can give you some color, but you are right. The average unit volumes that are opening are slightly down and I can give you some of the reasons. In the pool right now, we've got 100 small-box units that were test units that are obviously at slightly lower volume. We've got a little heavier weighting on Pizza Hut Home Service and our new-unit development is a little bit heavier weighted towards tiers 3 through 6.","In fact, the majority of the development occurs there while some of the stores that we're closing are a little heavier weighted towards Tiers 1 and 2. When you add up all of those smaller points, you get to a little bit of a drag on new-unit volumes, but most importantly critical to us, is we're very happy with our development programs. We're getting positive cash paybacks, three to four years. Margins are improving, sales trends are improving. So we feel good about our development program. I don't know, Micky, if you have anything else to add?","Micky Pant","No, I think you covered it well, David. I just want to reassure you -- I think this question came up in the last earnings call as well, is that is there anything fundamentally changing about our strategy or the delivery of sales and profits from new units as we go forward as compared to the past? And I think in general terms the answer is, no. We continue to build aggressively. The brand mix changed a bit and you know as David mentioned, we did build Pizza Hut Home Service restaurants that tend to be lower volume and KFC had slowed a little bit because of the two years of difficulty in sales.","We fully expect KFC development this year to be ahead of our original plans and in general terms, we see the efficiency and delivery from new units as being just as good as it's been in the past. In general terms, our focus at the moment is to raise traffic and sales in all our stores and that's one of the reasons we moderated new unit builds this year. We're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing and we hope we can continue to deliver growth in sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Gonzalez","It's Eric Gonzalez on for Dave Palmer. Just wondering if you could talk about Pizza Hut Casual Dining in terms of what's happening there in terms of price construct and media message? And also KFC seems to be on firmer footing. Maybe you can comment on some changes that are happening there? And then for both brands we were wondering how is the innovation pipeline different today in terms of tested innovation and how does that compare to a year ago?","Micky Pant","Okay, well Pizza Hut Casual Dining I think is in a much better position with regards to the consumer proposition than it was even I would say three months ago. The positioning of the brand is quite clear. It's been explained and carried forward through the organization. It's an integrated position which covers new product development as well as service down to uniforms etcetera. and I think it's resonating well. It's called Love to Share and it's appropriate because unlike KFC where most people come in single or order their meals individually; in Pizza Hut, it's a group that tend to order their meals together. And also as you know there's a big phenomenon now of sharing the food experience through social media. And all of that is working in our favor. On both brands, the emphasis has been to continue our rate of innovation and to continue to give consumers great news.","The difference is that we're doing it in a way that is operationally friendly so that it does not slow speed of service or cause problems with value. In the case of KFC, for example, as Greg mentioned, that includes Box Meals which has a well tried-and-tested formula globally that offers consumers not three but five items for a slightly higher price and offers great value. The innovation across all platforms is strong, but the big difference I think is that it is now a practical innovation that gives choice without complicating operations a great deal. Across all dayparts also, we've made significant investments in high quality coffee machines in both brands and high quality ice cream machines in the case of KFC to be able to improve our delivery and our quality of product.","Greg Creed","Let me just add. I think what you are seeing in China is what you are starting to see in the rest of the world which is on the KFC brand, we're very focused on what buckets, boxes, burgers and wings and on Pizza Hut it's back to pizzas and pan pizzas in particular, so I think a return to the core and belief in the core that it can drive same-store sales is what you are seeing in China. I think it's resonating there and it's what you'll also see in the balance of our business around the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Glass","I just wanted to go back to this inflection in China because I think it's important, but if I recall correctly you were down 11% in the first half or first seven weeks of the quarter last year and then you we were up like over 30%. So first of all, is that correct? What drove that inflection last year just so we understand what the hill we have to climb this year is and what we're up against and you didn't update your total comp guidance for the year for China. Last quarter you said you didn't want to either. Do you have any updated thought just on the year holistically so that we can think about this beyond the next few weeks?","David Gibbs","I guess what I would say is, it's really quite hard to look at one, two, three year comps in China and with any certainty be able to forecast sales. We're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing right now. We're not changing our annual guidance of 2% to 3% same-store sales growth in China. We're in that range today year to date, but certainly if the current trends continue we would be able to beat that number. We do caution that the second half laps get more difficult, but again it depends on how you look at them. The initial food event that we're lapping occurred towards the back half of July and that makes the comps really hard to look at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Bittner","I will try to wrap two questions into one. Couldn't help but notice the at least language that's in the new profit guidance, that at least language wasn't in the old guidance. Was that deliberate? Are you starting to see some nice potential upside to profits on the back half given the potential operating leverage that you get out of China and maybe some easier profit laps from some of the non-China segments? And also on the G&A side, Greg, you talked about an optimized cost structure when you have the franchise model in place. Is that something we're going to hear more about at the Analyst Day or is there any initial thoughts you can maybe give us on how you are thinking about that today? Thanks.","Greg Creed","I will take the second one first which was G&A. I think as we've said and continue to say, we will have a comprehensive review of our G&A structure in October when we meet. Obviously we're going through the whole strategy structure, the culture process and I'm very confident that we will be able to share in great detail those numbers when we meet in October. So I think we're only a couple of months away. We're finalizing all of those plans and we will be able to provide a greater amount of detail about the efficiency we can bring to the business. With that I will throw the first part of the question back to--","David Gibbs","Just in terms of our forecasting through the year, the use of the word at least obviously indicates that we see some upside to the numbers that we're communicating, but as we've all learned, these are difficult businesses to forecast with any precision. I feel more comfortable conveying where we're at with those terms.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Sara Senatore","I will also ask I think a two-part question here on China, if I may. First, I was interested to hear you say that you are still going after the lower-tier cities in the sense that all of the macroeconomic indicators seem to be weaker in many of those cities than they are in the higher tiers. So I just wanted to ask about new unit economics, confirmation that they are still very good in those lower-tier cities given what we're hearing about just the macro backdrop?","And I guess the second point was about the China margins. I know you gave some color on that. Also surprised to see the commodity -- it looked like the food margins were good in the context of it seems like an emphasis on value, so maybe you could just help me think through what the complexion of those margins should look like going forward? Will we continue to get that kind of tailwind and will there be headwinds on the labor and expense side? So the unit economics and margins, if you will.","David Gibbs","I will take the margin question and then I will turn it over to Micky for some color on developments which is what I think you are looking for. On the margins, you can see we had 1 point of margin improvement in China in the second quarter. That was really fundamentally the food and paper outperformed the inflation that we saw in labor to give us a 1 point benefit. What went into that food and paper upside is really sort of four components. It was a price benefit, a mix benefit. We did have deflation and then of course, the VAT shows up there and in a couple of other line items. And then I will turn it over to Micky for some color on development.","Micky Pant","Yes, I think one of the strengths of Yum! in China is that we're so widely present across the country, as you know over 1,000 cities with KFC. As mentioned earlier, our Pizza Hut development rate this year has been moderated a bit, but KFC will be on or ahead of plan. I can confirm that our new unit returns are very high. They are at the highest they've been for four years in terms of percentage of units beating hurdle rate as set in the CapEx. So we're very confident that we're not over-expanding at all in the smaller-tier cities. It is our belief that under challenging economic conditions you get the best long term deals and if we're able to secure long leases for these stores, we're very confident these stores will make good returns in the future. So I don't think we're concerned at the moment with the rate of return on our new store sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead.","David Tarantino","My question is about the divisions outside of China which you said on a combined basis are tracking to reach their profit plan, but it does look like they might miss their original cost plan. So the question is, what is supporting the profit outlook and does that comment apply to each of the divisions individually or is that a comment on the combined basis?","David Gibbs","I think on a combined basis, we did talk about that the second half of the year would be better for us from a profit standpoint and that Q2 was a difficult quarter for us. So as I reiterated in my prepared remarks, we feel like the divisions from a profit standpoint are on track.","Greg Creed","And I think the other thing is, as we said we're seeing some improvement as we start the third quarter. Taco Bell which obviously was negative in Q2 has turned positive in Q3 through the first five or six weeks of the quarter. The KFC U.S. number is also stronger than the plus 2% we had, so I think we're feeling that there's some momentum. Obviously, I think as we all know in the U.S., the market is a little soft, but I think that we see some momentum in sales. I think that we believe that commodities will be under control and I think as I even may have said on the last call, we're confident we can deliver the outside of China profit numbers even if the sales numbers are just a little tough to get to.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.","Joseph Buckley","I wanted to just check on the check and the traffic components of the same-store sales. I'd love to get it for both China KFC and Pizza Hut individually and then for the U.S. comps for KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.","David Gibbs","Yes. So for China, we can provide you at a division level that price contributed 2 points, mix contributed 3 points and that covered a 5 point decline in transactions. Of course as we talked about on the last call, the transaction decline is not necessarily per person, as we think our party size has increased given the promotions that we're running.","Greg Creed","And if you, if you want to talk about the U.S., I think that was also part of the question. I think the Taco Bell miss was a transaction miss pretty much. I think that's probably the best way to describe it. And our look at the category also is probably for the trailing 13 weeks the U.S. is probably running about minus 1 same-store transactions and probably around plus 1 same-store sales. So that's the sort of numbers that we see. But the Taco Bell miss was essentially driven by transactions. But as I said, I'm happy that in the first five or six weeks of the third quarter we're back in positive territory on Taco Bell. So that's a nice change in momentum.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Karen Holthouse","Just actually a follow-up to the pricing piece in China, it seems like it's a little bit more price than we seen since some of the food safety incidents happened. As you are getting farther away from that and you sound pretty positive on underlying momentum in the brands and the positioning, do you think that's giving you permission to potentially get a little bit more aggressive on the pricing front if you want to?","David Gibbs","Let me clarify something, Karen, then I will turn it over to Micky. On the pricing, that was all roll-over pricing, there was no pricing raise in the quarter. But I will turn it over to Micky for more color.","Micky Pant","Thank you. Karen, in general we had as you know, commodities were very favorable in the first half, so we really didn't see any reason to take pricing. We continue to offer bigger meal bundles and especially buckets and they offer a great value anyway. The net impact of pricing is actually two which is all rollover. The rest of it one shape, way or form is on account of more customers or more food per customer which are both good news. We have to watch commodity inflation in the back half. ","At the moment we feel pretty confident that we can deliver through other productivity initiatives our profit targets without having to take recourse through pricing. But obviously we remain sensitive to commodity and we will not be stupid about it, but we do want to contain pricing for as long as possible, to maintain price stability in the market as well as to continue to offer great value. We're very focused on transaction growth, but we will not do it at the expense of profits come to that.","The way things are at the moment, we feel pretty comfortable that through the year we do not have to take any further pricing, but we're watching commodity, especially poultry very carefully in the back half.","Karen Holthouse","And if you are not going to take any pricing for--","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Just two related questions on the China separation and the cash flow it's generating. One just on the separation, I'm just wondering whether there's any consideration at all for options other than the current spin plan? There's always talk about a sale of part or all to third parties or other opportunities and I'm just wondering whether you would offer any insight onto that?","And then the second question was just on the cash return. I think, Greg, in your prepared remarks you say we're going to return a significant amount before and after the spin. I'm just wondering whether we should assume it's a traditional open market share purchase which I guess gives you the flexibility or are you considering maybe ASRs or special dividends or other forms of that? Thank you.","Greg Creed","I think with regard to the spin, I think as we've said multiple times, we looked at a number of options to maximize shareholder value and we believe and continue to believe that a separation or a spin is the best way to maximize shareholder value. We're 100% focused on that.","As we said in the Form 10 filings -- everything else is going ahead in China, starting things like Board selection. And so we're really doing all the things you'd expect. We're right on our timeline in order to hit the separation on October 31, plus or minus a couple of days. And we continue to believe that is the very best way to maximize shareholder value. I will hand over to David who can just give you an update on cash return.","David Gibbs","Yes, as far as cash return goes, obviously we feel good about the share repurchases we've made year-to-date at attractive prices and that our stock is priced attractively for continued share buyback. But that's something that we will continue to evaluate. There's other options, special dividends, tender offers and we will continue to revisit that decision as time goes on, but the intent obviously is to return that cash this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles","A lot of my questions has been answered but, Micky, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of positive gross margins in China, so I just wanted to ask holistically about your willingness to sacrifice some of that margin in order to drive traffic by focusing more aggressively on value. I know obviously you are going to have some pricing that rolls off and inflation is likely to reaccelerate. But just thinking about how that ties into the margin profile of Box Meals?","And then separately, David, just a follow-up on that last question. Was just hoping you guys could take about how you are evaluating the remaining $3.3 billion of cash return to shareholders through October. Current trading prices, we're estimating this is going to be about 20% of your daily trading volume if you were to repurchase that all over the course of every day over the next three-and-a-half months. So it just seems like an ambitious endeavor and just want to hear what kind of factors would lead you guys to relocate some of the cash through a special dividend? Thank you.","Micky Pant","I will just take your pricing question and then hand over to David. We do not really see any need at the moment to sacrifice margins. We believe we have good price points now.","We've captured key velocity price points around the RMB29 mark for individual meals for slightly bigger meals for individuals at RMB35 mark and I believe our buckets are competitively priced. We're very keen to hold that for a period, but we don't see any reason to lace up the transactions any further. I don't think it will get helped particularly by pricing.","We're however doing more and more effective marketing activity through digital media, etcetera. which is a complicated topic, but we're getting higher and higher efficiencies that's allowing us to target specific consumers that will allow us to drive traffic to our stores and develop sales satisfactorily. So the short answer is we're not looking at all to dilute our margin.","David Gibbs","Yes and then on the share buyback question, just a little bit more detail on that. Our plan is to get the vast majority of the buyback done by the separation. But obviously we're going to be smart about it and recognize that we have to comply with the regulations on that. So some of that may spill over but we still think we will get it all done by the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead.","Dennis Geiger","Greg, can you talk a little bit more about the brands in the U.S. and how you feel you are positioned on value currently, particularly at Taco Bell? Any surprises over the last few months that you've seen from competitors or the changes in consumer sentiment that has made you change your approach and get even more aggressive than you had otherwise planned into the back half of the year?","Greg Creed","That's a good question. I think, as we said earlier, there is I call it a malaise in the U.S., is probably the best way to describe it. And I think there was an interesting report out yesterday that I think 75% of people 18 to 30 believe that the U.S. is either falling behind or failing as a nation, according to a GenForward Survey. So that's not particularly good news from just what are people thinking. As I said earlier, we believe that in the U.S. the market is on a trailing 13 is about a minus 1% in transacts, it's probably plus 1% in sales.","As I said, I think the good news is we have started the third quarter stronger than we had in the second quarter. I think what it means is for brands like Taco Bell, we've got to make sure that we get our communication really tight and focused. I don't necessarily believe it means we have to drop our prices anymore. I think we've got to do a better job of communicating our value. And we also have to remember that the Taco Bell brand always responds to incredible breakthrough innovation. So I think you'll see more of that coming from Taco Bell. I have to give the KFC U.S. teams credit. I think George Hamilton, as the new Colonel behind Extra Crispy is brilliant and that is having a positive impact on our sales momentum at KFC in the U.S. right now.","So we've gone back to a core product. We haven't had to discount. We've obviously wrapped it around $20 buckets and $5 boxes, but we've just done a much better job of breaking through with the communication. And then I think on Pizza Hut, we've announced that we're moving to a new agency. We will get to a new campaign sometime before the end of the year and I think the Pizza Hut team would agree, we can do a better job of communicating both better and easy. So I'm positive about what's happening now and I'm positive about what the guys are working on.","And as I said, kudos to the KFC team, who I think have taken a core product and demonstrated you can deliver above-category growth by making sure you really have breakthrough communication. So better communication and making sure we've got the right price point, making sure we've got breakthrough innovation. I know that's what the three U.S. brands are focused on. I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing and I'm encouraged by the momentum we have going into the third quarter.","Greg Creed","So what I would like to do, I think just to quickly wrap up. So first of all, I want to thank you all for being on the call. We really appreciate it. Pretty much my last answer probably summed up a lot of it which was we're encouraged by the progress we're making, particularly in those businesses that we've been focused on which is both Pizza Hut and KFC in China as well as KFC and Pizza Hut in the U.S. As I said, we're off to a good start in the third quarter in both China and the U.S. and all of us and particularly I'm looking forward to catching up with everyone at the Investor Conference in New York on October 11. Thanks for being with us today. We really appreciate it.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22683":["Yum! Brands Inc.

Before I talk about our third quarter performance, I think it\u2019s important to note this past Sunday, October 7th marked our 15th anniversary as a company. From the very beginning, our formula for success has been people capability first, satisfied customers and profitability follow; I am proud of how we went to get our ownership culture we\u2019ve developed and pleased with the strong returns we\u2019ve generated for our shareholders.","As we look back over the past 15 years, we take satisfaction by what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish, but as you\u2019ll hear more about today, we\u2019re even more excited about the unfinished business that lies ahead. When we started our company, we benchmarked high performing companies and all were known for their consistent double-digit annual EPS growth. As a result, we built our company around the objective of delivering dynasty like performance of at least 10% annual EPS growth. We just raised our guidance and we expect that 2012 will mark the 11th consecutive year we deliver at least 13% EPS growth before special items.","As you know, there are three keys to driving shareholder value in retail; new unit development, same-store sales growth and high returns. Our new unit opportunity in China is the best in retail and our opportunity to expand is now bigger than ever throughout the emerging markets. As I said before, Yum! Brands is about China and so much more.","As evidenced about 60% of our profit is generated in emerging markets which is where the real economic growth in the world is occurring today. This growth, combined with the facts that we have powerful global brands and only two restaurants per million people in emerging markets compared with 58 restaurants per million people in the U.S. gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue our aggressive expansion.","Further, I would not trade our opportunity to grow same-store sales with anyone. We have 38,000 restaurants with underutilized assets. We are laying the foundation for more substantial same-store sales growth by developing breakfast, beverages and broad and improved asset utilization overtime. Meanwhile, our returns continue to be among the best in the restaurant industry with return on invested capital over 22%.","These facts give us confidence that our business model deliver strong results in even the most challenging economic times; unlike most companies, we don't have to look for growth, it\u2019s staring us right in the face everyday and we expect this opportunity will allow us to build on our track record of at least 10% earnings per share growth in 2013 and well into the future.","Now on to our results; I am pleased to report each of our divisions produced strong sales and profit results driving 19% EPS growth prior to special items. Given the strength of our year-to-date results, as I just mentioned, we are raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 13% excluding special items. We expect to open a record 1,750 plus new international units this year, including over 750 new units in China. That\u2019s two new restaurants per day in China and nearly five new restaurants per day around the world.","Equally important, we have same-store sales growth across our divisions. This combination of record new unit development and strong same-store sales growths has delivered high quality earnings this year and gives us even more confidence in delivering a strong 2013 as well.","Now let me take you through our key strategies in China and India and then Rick will take you through our strategies at Yum! Restaurants International in the United States; Pat Grismer will then review our financial progress.","I am obviously very proud of our China team\u2019s continued strong performance. For the third quarter, operating profit grew 22% prior to foreign currency translations. Units expanded 18% and system sales grew 22%. And importantly, and as we predicted, restaurant level margins improved dramatically compared to our second quarter.","Same-store sales grew at a healthy rate of 6% with transactions down 1%. Keep in mind this is overlapping 19% same-stores sales growth with transaction growth of 27% during the third quarter of last year. When you do the math, our two year same-store sales growth is an impressive 26% with two year same-stores transaction growth of 26% as well.","What makes this even more impressive is that we\u2019re driving record new unit development at the same time. We\u2019re excited that the China team is going to open over 750 new restaurants this year. Our new unit returns in China remained the best in our business. We know we are building shareholder value with cash paybacks less than three years.","However you should know that my number one challenge to the team is to never build faster than our people capabilities. Fortunately, as our scale grows in China, our people capability continues to get even stronger. We hired 10,000 new management trainees over the past year through our Whampoa Academy, and currently have 2,000 assistant managers in our system today who are ready to become restaurant general managers and continue to build on a reputation for operational excellence. Our focus on people capability first is alive and well in China.","Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. Let\u2019s start with KFC, the largest western QSR concept in China. Our first KFC restaurant opened in China in 1987. So we\u2019ve been in China for 25 years now. I am proud to say that we recently opened our 4,000 KFC restaurants.","It took 17 years to open our first 1,000 restaurants but only two years to open our most recent 1000. We continue to expand our unit advantage over our nearest competitor and we're growing in both large and smaller cities throughout the country. ","We're acquiring the premier sites in the most vibrant trade zones and we're using our assets throughout the day with breakfast, delivery and 24 hour operations. Our new fast food business model balances great tasting food with high quality service and speed. We offer a balanced menu across multiple proteins and day parts and promote healthy lifestyles as well as focus on being rooted in China with continuous innovation. ","We constantly monitor key consumer metrics and continue to win with Chinese consumers. Now all of this success is underpinned by world-class operations and outstanding people capabilities. Having said this, the most exciting new news in the past couple of years has been the tremendous growth and vibrancy of the Pizza brand. ","Pizza Casual Dining goes beyond Pizza and continues to unquestionably be the leading western casual dining concept in China with over 700 units in 120 cities. The Pizza menu is revamped twice a year and continues to offer a broad variety of entrees including beef, chicken and rice dishes along with appetizers, beverages and deserts. ","We're having tremendous success building a true western casual dining concept with everyday affordable value. In fact, our new unit returns are at least equal to the fantastic returns for KFC and we expect to open over 150 Pizza Casual Dining restaurants this year. We are especially pleased to be opening Pizza Huts not only in the largest cities but in Tier three, four and five cities as well where there is nearly one billion people.","We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service and the Home Delivery category now has a 140 units in 14 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand now has 28 restaurants.","We continue to make progress as we drive for scalable economics with both of these concepts. As you know, we acquired Little Sheep China\u2019s leading hot pot concept in February of this year. We acquired Little Sheep to strengthen net operating model and increase its market leadership position. ","We know this is a powerful brand and we have the expertise to make it even stronger. We have completed management integration in the Yum!\u2019s China team and have new initiatives moving through the pipeline. We didn\u2019t buy this business for it\u2019s 400 plus units, we bought this brand for its potential for 1000\u2019s of restaurant. Let me assure you our long-term belief in this brand continues to be very high.","In summary, our China business is having another strong year. But as I said before, China is going to have its inevitable ups and downs. And like I said last quarter, we now face a slowing economy. But that doesn\u2019t change our long-term outlook in China one iota. Our annual performance has been pretty consistent and I expect this to continue. ","The progress we\u2019re making in executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category is exceptional. And we\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver strong growth in 2013 and beyond.","Now let\u2019s talk about our India division where our brands are all about the youth and providing an aspirational experience. We have 495 restaurants in our India division and expect to open 100 new restaurants this year. Our KFC business model is getting stronger, working both large and smaller cities.","The team has gone to (inaudible) on what makes KFC so successful in China and we are applying these strategies to India. Based on the unit economics we are seeing, we believe there is a compelling reason to put even more capital to work at KFC in China and India excuse me. We are laying the foundation for this business to have leading brands in every significant category in India including KFC, Pizza Casual Dining, Pizza Hut Home Service, and Taco Bell. We expect this business to have a substantial impact on Yum!'s profit growth in the future. ","Now let me hand it over to Rick, who is going to give you an update on Yum! Restaurants International and our US business.","Rick Carucci","Thank you, David. Let me start this morning with Yum! Restaurant International which is perhaps the most under appreciated piece of Yum! YRI has a great business portfolio. There are tremendous development opportunities in emerging and underdeveloped markets and over 85% of YRI\u2019s 14,000 restaurants or franchise.","This combination creates a steady stream of franchise royalties and strong growth. For the quarter, YRI delivered system sales growth of 4% and operating profit growth of 14% prior to foreign currency translation. Same store sales increased 2% led by a 5% increase in emerging markets. These YRI same-store sales were negatively impacted by about one point due to calendar shift of Ramadan into the third quarter of 2012. ","With the results we have seen so far this year, we are well on our way to build 900 new units in 2012. While Yum! Restaurant International has tremendous growth opportunities in many parts of the world. I am going to spend some time today talking about the roles of four markets, France, Germany and Russia as well as the African continent. ","First let me put France, Germany and Russia into perspective. In these three countries combined, McDonalds has about 2,900 units and makes well over a $1 billion in profits. Last year in these countries YRI had 383 restaurants that made less than $30 million in profits. So we know we have a tremendous runway for growth. In France, we have 143 restaurants, we are on the air with national television advertising and we have the highest KFC average unit volumes in the world.","We are using a business rental program which we patterned after the successful model used in France by McDonalds. This approach combined with the strong KFC consumer proposition is driving disciplined unit growth. We are making significant progress building a profitable business in France and we are using a similar approach in Germany.","I recently visited Germany where we now have 81 KFC\u2019s. I saw that KFC is leveraging especially prepared chicken to differentiate itself on food quality. The German team and franchisees are really excited because we have the scale necessary now to begin national advertising in 2013.","David, Pat and I were also able to see our Russia business in person in August. We all came away amazed at the breakthrough progress [Olympus], Rob and his team are making. Two years ago, our restaurants in Russia were all franchise. They were only sub-brands of these KFC\u2019s. They had average unit volumes of about $1.2 million. ","Well, in the past two years, Russia has had the highest KFC same-store sales growth in the world. So as we sit here today, we now have a 180 KFC\u2019s averaging $1.8 million. The team has improved operations in brand marketing and has converted almost 100% of the system to standalone KFC\u2019s.","We attended Restaurant General Manager Conference in Moscow where we met many talented and committed RGMs. McDonalds has a tremendous business in Russia, so we know we have a long way to go. However, after seeing how our KFC brand is evolving and the quality of our team, we left with even more confidence about our growth prospects in Russia and our ability to build a very strong business there.","The last YRI market I would like to highlight is Africa, and as you think about Africa in several pieces. We have a very robust business in South Africa with 650 KFC\u2019s we\u2019re clearly the market leader. We have also been expecting to be in 17 African countries outside of South Africa by the end of 2012 including Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana.","Our primary objective is to build people capability, infrastructure and scaling these countries. We do not expect them to add significantly to our profit results in the next several years. However, we are very pleased that we have started the journey in this part of Africa. With over 1 billion people, Africa can be a very significant business for Yum! and we are proud to be the restaurant leader on this continent.","We generated about $50 million of profit from South Africa last year. So if you include France, Germany and Russia and South Africa, we made less than a $100 million in these markets combined. However, these four markets have impressive short-term and long-term growth potential. Together they have the ability to generate up to half of YRI\u2019s 10% targeted profit growth over the next four years.","Overall, the Yum! Restaurants International business is on-track. We are having a strong year in 2012 and we believe we are well positioned for future success. Our strategy remains to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere.","Now on to our U.S. business where our ongoing goal has been to improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. Same-store sales were up 6% in the third quarter and year-to-date. In the third quarter, operating profits grew 13% and is up 22% year-to-date. We have structured the U.S. business for more consistent returns and are putting the building blocks in place to build more powerful brands and to sustain our performance going forward.","Back in 2008, we began reducing our company ownership levels in the U.S. By the end of this year, we have taken our company-owned restaurants from 3,900 to less than 1,700 therefore cutting our equity units by more than half. We have put our restaurants in the hands of capable franchisees while improving our return on capital in the U.S. business by about four points.","We have essentially completed our KFC and Pizza re-franchising. We began one modest re-franchising of Taco Bell restaurants last year although our U.S. ownership will remain skewed towards Taco Bell. We expect to reach our target ownership levels by the end of 2013. At that time, our U.S. company mix will be about 10% compared to the 22% mix we had at the beginning of 2008.","As the largest U.S. brand, Taco Bell has been the catalyst of our 2012 U.S. performance. The brand has made great strides with key price introductions at the Doritos and Locos Tacos and Cantina Bell. The good news is that these initiatives not only delivered strong sales this year, but should drive sales in 2013 with new flavor varieties of line extensions to complement our current menu.","Our biggest global initiative is driving well class operations and I am pleased that Taco Bell continues to make progress in this arena year-after-year. Taco Bell was just recognized for being in the top two in both drive through speed and accuracy by QSR magazine, a goal that they have been aspiring to achieve for several years.","Pizza Hut and KFC have also contributed significantly to our U.S. performance this year. Pizza Hut has been able to stay relative to consumers by combining strong value with its $10 any pizza and salad innovation. This system has also successfully reversed its trend of declining units by introducing a smaller, less expensive delivery concept we call Delco Lite. After 10 years of unit declines, Pizza Hut added 53 net units in 2011 and expects to add over 130 net new units this year. Our franchisees are very excited about these initiatives and the returns that are generating.","At KFC, we know we have some heavy sliding ahead of us, but we are stabilizing the business and working better with our franchisees. Our number one focus is to improve our operations. This system is making investments in technology and equipment that can provide a more consistent customer experience. With the successful introduction of Bites and a larger advertising presence, it\u2019s good to see improvement in 2012 in same-store sales and brand profitability.","We have initiated supply chain initiatives across our U.S. brands. Thanks to partnering with our purchasing coop and our franchisees commodity costs in the US this year are essentially flat which we believe is below the industry rate of inflation. So when we look across our U.S. business, we are proud of what we are accomplishing this year and we also believe that we are improving our business model. We are building a foundation to deliver growth in 2013 and more consistent results going forward.","Now let me hand it over to Pat Grismer, our CFO.","Pat Grismer","Thank you, Rick. To start, I would like to thank our operating divisions for their outstanding third quarter performance as 19% EPS growth excluding special items was led by an impressive 18% growth in operating profit prior to foreign currency translation. It\u2019s great to see each of our businesses deliver such strong results reflecting the resilience of our global brands and business models in uncertain times.","As David and Rick have already summarized third quarter results for each of our divisions, I will limit my Q3 remarks to three key items of interest. China restaurants margin, China new unit development and Yum! shareholder cash payouts; I\u2019ll then lay out our expectations for the fourth quarter and share some initial thoughts on 2013.","First China restaurant margin; you\u2019ll recall that China margin was down 4 percentage points in the second quarter compared to prior year. As we expected, this trend reversed in the third quarter with margin improving modestly over prior year due to based pricing actions and lower inflation. For the third consecutive quarter, inflation rates fell for both labor and commodities in Q3 coming in at 8% and 2% respectively. This result reinforces our belief that China can sustain a restaurant margin of 20% over the long run.","Second, China new unit development; as David mentioned, our China division now expects to open over 750 new units this year. To put this into perspective, I would like to point out that a couple of years ago in 2010; China\u2019s new unit growth rate was 13%. This year, it is 18% on a much larger store base. This is a clear breakthrough in development performance and a testament to the size and scale of our China development team.","Of course, in light of these development results, we're sometimes asked whether we are growing too fast in China. The simple answer is that we approach China development extreme rigor, taking care not too let our cash get out in front of our people capability. This development discipline has four key pillars. ","Number one, we allocate significant resources to China development with a world-class team that is 1,000 team member strong on the ground, finding, evaluating and securing sights. Capability, that is unmatched in China today. ","Number two, we select sites based on an intermittent understanding of retail development in China, fully informed by our experience with 5,000 restaurants today, a proprietary database that grows in size and sophistication with each passing year.","Number three; we evolve our new store portfolio to optimize our returns. For example, shifting development from Tier one cities where store margins are under some pressure to lower tier cities where returns are higher. ","And number four, as David mentioned, we build a large pipeline of fully qualified restaurant general managers to ensure we open new stores with excellence delivering on our brand promise.","This is why we are comfortable with our rate of expansion in China and confident in our ability to sustain high returns and generate significant operating cash from this business which brings me to my third Q3 topic Yum! shareholder cash payouts.","We recently increased our dividend by 18% marking our eighth consecutive annual double-digit percentage increase one of only 12 companies in the S&P 500 to do so. With this rate of growth, we\u2019ve doubled our dividend in less than five years while also returning significant cash through share repurchases.","This year through Q3, we repurchased shares totaling just over $700 million and we continue to expect at least $800 million in repurchases for the full year. Adding it up, we will return over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this year all while continuing to invest behind new store development and other growth engines.","Now I\u2019m going to talk about our expectations for the fourth quarter. In China, we anticipate modest year-over-year margin improvement in Q4 similar to what we saw in the third quarter. This margin improvement and continued strength in new unit development should deliver solid double-digit profit growth for China in the fourth quarter.","I\u2019m sure many of you are interested to know how same-store sales are currently trending in China, remember our overlap is two points higher as we move into fourth quarter with same-store sales growth of 21% last year. ","So we do expect comps to moderate further. Additionally, Q4 is our longest fiscal quarter and with three months remaining in a volatile and slowing economy, sales are tough to predict. At this point, our best estimate is that China same-store sales will be low-single digits to flat in Q4.","Now before I talk about YRI and the US, I\u2019d first like to remind everyone that we have an overlapped headwind due to an additional week in our 2011 fiscal year. This additional week produced a $26 million operating profit benefit to YRI and the US combined or over 4 percentage points of EPS growth. This will obviously have a negative impact on this year\u2019s fourth quarter growth.","At YRI, we expect fourth quarter same-store sales growth to benefit from the timing of Ramadan reversing the impact seen in Q3. This will contribute to solid profit growth for YRI in Q4 which will be partially offset by the 53rd week overlap that provided an $8 million compared to operating profit last year.","In the United States we will see substantially weaker performance in the fourth quarter than we have seen so far this year. There are three key reasons why. First, we will have a headwind that went up $18 million as we overlap last year\u2019s 53rd week benefit. This alone equates to 10 points of profit growth on the quarter.","Second, we expect more moderate same-store sales growth than we have seen so far this year in part because we will be lapping our toughest comps from last year. And finally, our year-to-date refranchising of 340 US restaurants will be profit diluted in the fourth quarter albeit shareholder value positive in the long run.","In summary for the full year, we are expecting significant profit growth from each of our divisions led by strong sales performance across of our entire business. Therefore, we are raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 13% excluding special items marking the 11th consecutive years we are expecting to deliver at least 13% EPS growth.","Considering the challenging global economy, I am very pleased with our performance and the overall quality of our earnings growth in 2012. I am also confident that our work this year is setting us up nicely for a solid 2013. ","We are still in the process of developing detailed plans for our businesses next year and as usual we will provide additional perspective at our December meeting in New York. However, I do want to share some initial thoughts for 2013. First, we are fortunate that our new unit development provides us with head start on building next year\u2019s profit plan and this year\u2019s record level pace of 1,750 new units outside the US provides us with the best development driven tail win we ever had. ","In China specifically, our current development rate is 18% which is well above the low double digit percentage unit increase our ongoing growth model requires. As system sales growth is driven by both new unit development and same-store sales growth, this year\u2019s accelerated pace of development reduces our dependence on same-stores sales growth in 2013 to achieve China\u2019s targeted profit growth of 15%. ","Nevertheless, we do expect same-stores sales growth in China next year with our new product pipeline as strong as ever and at about 4 points of pricing as we enter the year. At Yum! Restaurant International, our ongoing growth model cost for net unit growth of 3% to 4%. This year, we will build 900 new units driving net unit growth of 4%. When you consider that India is no longer contributing to YRI\u2019s new units, this effectively amounts to an increase in YRI\u2019s development pace. ","Our growth model calls for same-store sales growth of at least 2% to 3% of YRI and we look to be on track to deliver this. Additionally, over 45% of YRI\u2019s units are in emerging markets where economic growth is higher than the rest of the world further bolstering YRI same-store sales growth expectations for 2013.","In the US our ongoing growth model calls for same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%. As you know, the US had an outstanding year this year and Taco bell is now building up two great new platforms, Doritos Locos Tacos and Cantina Bell. These platforms will be the catalyst for innovation in 2013, driving same-store sales to expected levels.","In 2012, we also had net unit growth at both Taco Bell and Pizza Hut and expect this to continue next year as well. And finally, we\u2019ll continue to benefit from our restaurant productivity initiatives, which have delivered significant benefits to our U.S. businesses this year.","In conclusion, we have a lot of confidence in our business model and the consistency that Yum! provides to the power of our global portfolio. At the end of 2012, this portfolio will have delivered annual double-digit EPS growth over the past 11 years, even in challenging macroeconomic circumstances and our global brand portfolio has never been stronger as our teams continue to grow and invest in emerging markets and manage cost efficiently. For these reasons, I strongly believe that 2013 will be another year where Yum! will deliver double-digit EPS growth for our shareholders.","And with that, we\u2019re happy to take questions Ashley.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS","Good morning and congrats on the quarter and also thanks for the details on this call. You mentioned the China economy is slowing and the fourth quarter same-store sales were at less pricing and that leads you to the low single digit to flat guidance there. Is there anything beyond, in the details of your business and the trends that you are seeing that gives you visibility in terms of where things may bottom in terms of same-store sales and I mentioned that just naturally investors are going to be off balance until they figure our where the bottom in your at least the same-store sales are going to be, is there any sense of that for you in your China business? Thanks.","David Novak","","David I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll drill the answer to that. First of all, we\u2019re not economist or we\u2019re not, we can\u2019t we have not really seen or read any news or have any real news that you really don\u2019t have or you can\u2019t read about already and what we do see is clearly that there is an economic slowdown in China which again is not any news than we talked about this the last time.","I think the biggest thing that I would want to just point is we\u2019ve been able to deliver consistent results and we\u2019ve been able to do that year-after-year. And I think it\u2019s because our business model is really strong and obviously China even with its challenges is still growing at a reasonable pace. It\u2019s up, GDP was up 7% in the second quarter; it\u2019s expected to be up 8% in 2013 according to the Financial Times and retail growth is supposed to be double the GDP.","I think for us, the biggest tailwind we have is just the consuming class continues to grow expected to double in the next 10 years. And you guys read the same stuff we read and look same facts are reported. Personal incomes, the middle class incomes are rising, which is also a big plus. And as you saw, our infrastructure, the infrastructure growth is really continuing to grow at a higher rate. So we\u2019ve got all these new cities and clusters and trade zones coming into play that we\u2019re able to now penetrate.","And so I think the big news for us is old news frankly is that we\u2019re really in position to capitalize on what\u2019s going on in China more which is still the fastest growing economy more than any other retail in the world, we have got leading brands, a business model with three year cash-on-cash, the returns, competitive brand positions that are better than they have ever been. We have got unmatched development capability, you have seen our management team in action; they have been together for a long time, gets better and better, and a lot of young talent coming in. We own our supply chain and we are just attracting top talent, I mean the fact that I pointed out in my remarks, we have 10,000 management trainees this year and 2,000 ready to go assistant managers.","So, I think, I look at this business long-term, I have to say you know we\u2019re going to have our ups and downs right now, we\u2019re kind of based in a slower economy, but I am always going to be glad, I wake everyday and know that we have a position we have in China and I think as we look to the long terms, we are very confident in what we have ahead of us.","Rick Carucci","And David, what I would add to that is that we\u2019ve clearly acknowledged the same-store sales have slowed down in part because we are lapping extraordinary performance from last year, but also because the economy is swelling. But I also pointed out that given the accelerated pace of new unit development this year, tracking at 18% as we enter next year we are going to be less reliant on same-store sales growth to achieve our 15% profit growth for the China division.","So when you add that all up, when you consider the pace of development, when you consider the pricing that we have rolling into next year and the ongoing strength of our new product pipeline, not to mention, the strong people capability as David mentioned, we continue to be very optimistic that we will achieve that 15% profit growth for China next year.","Tim Jerzyk","Thanks. Next questions please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","Hi guys, I have I guess two questions. The first one is, how can we be confident in positive China same-store sales in \u201913 and as per your guidance when traffic is running negative right now, the economy is still decelerating and you\u2019ll have less pricing rolling through the P&L next year. So essentially what I am asking is what are you seeing that makes you, that makes positive your base case?","And then secondly, the accelerated new unit development in China; you talked about why you are comfortable with the pace of opening in the prepared remarks and it all makes total sense. But I just wanted to ask, if you were in fact growing too fast and may be making some mistakes that were being obscured by the near term growth that it provides, how would you know it before it was too late; what are you looking at?","David Novak","I am happy to respond to that Michael and I\u2019ll start with the second piece on development. As I mentioned, we have extraordinary development capability in China. We review the performance of our new units routinely paying attention to every possible operating metric you can imagine and there is extreme diligence around how we manage our new restaurant portfolio including shifting as I mentioned development from the Tier 1 cities of where returns have softened into the lower Tier cities where we have higher margins and our returns are outstanding.","So we do capitalize on what we learned from recent new store openings to inform how we manage our pipeline going forward. So there is extreme diligence and vigor around that entire process; regular review by again a team that is very, very experienced and unmatched in capability in China.","As for the second question on positive same-stores sales for next year, we do have four points of pricing as we enter next year and depending on how we construct our plan for next year, we may find opportunity to take additional pricing. But at the same time, we are confident in our track record of new product innovation and how we have been able to grow our business overtime we have added sales layers to our business. We're not fully penetrated in all of those sales layers.","So as we move those two, 100% penetration and we continue to introduce new product innovation. We're confident that we'll be able to generate eventually the same-store transaction growth along with the check growth that comes from pricing to achieve the same-store sales growth on New Year. Now as we said before, there can be volatility from quarter-to-quarter. So I am talking about a full-year basis when I say that we're optimistic that we will deliver the same-store sales growth in 2013. ","Rick Carucci","I think one other really good example on just how we approach development, a couple of years ago, Pizza Casual Dining, our unit economics had slowed down and so we did not expand further. We didn\u2019t move into Tier III, Tier IV, Tier V cities at all. What we did as we went back and the team revamped our business so that we added much more menu variety and we also took our value equation where we went with a eat like a rich man, eat like a poor man approach where we had a great every day value entry pricing, half priced menu, entrees on a daily basis and the transactions and profits just went through the roof. ","And then we started expanding into three, four and five cities. So, I think that\u2019s a great example that where we really follow our mantra which is don\u2019t get you cash out in front of your people capability and or your business model and we constantly are tracking our performance quarterly with what we call our new unit tracking system as Pat talked about, but that\u2019s a great example of how we look at things. I tell the guys all the time and I\u2019ve said this before, we got a great diamonds, great brands, keep caution don\u2019t grow any faster than we grow. ","And what\u2019s happening though is that we\u2019re able to grow fast because the opportunities are out there and increasing and we\u2019re able to deal with great returns for our shareholders. So we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re growing the business the right way and I can assure you that the team has been told and from day one we\u2019ve never been chasing a number. The number just keeps getting bigger and bigger than what any of us ever expected.","We went into this year with a projection of 600, okay, this was after we did 650 last year. Why was it 600? Don\u2019t grow faster than what we need to, we don\u2019t give, we\u2019re not trying to be heroes, we\u2019re trying to build a heroic business.","Tim Jerzyk","Next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan (inaudible) with Robert W. Baird.","Unidentified Analyst","Pat just a follow-up question on the restaurant margin outlook for China for Q4. And I\u2019m wondering specifically what your current expectation is in terms of commodity and wage rate inflation?","Pat Grismer","Absolutely, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are expecting modest year-over-year improvement in China margins in the fourth quarter comparable to what we saw in the third quarter but how we will get there will be a bit different. We\u2019re expecting for example, a positive impact from inflation because we expect there will be in fact deflation on our commodities in China in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019re expecting a lower a benefit from pricing as we rollover some pricing actions we took last year.","We\u2019re expecting the impact from new store development to be about the same. So when you add all of those factors together, we\u2019re looking at that point of improvement on margins year-over-year excluding the impact of Little Sheep.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And I guess one more clarification question just on the expectation for slower China comps in Q4. You mentioned that you\u2019re cycling price and you already recycled some again in November. So I just want to ask and I am wondering specifically on the traffic component for China, how much slow in you expect for that factor in Q4 and then whether or not you have actually seen that materialize yet quarter-to-date?","Pat Grismer","Well, just to recap a little bit. In Q3, what we have with 6% same-store sales growth, we had about a 7% pricing advantage. So as David mentioned, transactions were down about a point. And what we are expecting for Q4 as same-store sales growth of low-single digits to flat and we have about five points of pricing benefits, so that would give you low-single digit same-store transaction declined in the fourth quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, got it and which you read the pricing as a proxy for overall check growth?","Pat Grismer","Yeah.","Tim Jerzyk","Thanks Jon. Next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason West for Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Just one thing on the modeling or as two things on the China revenue side that did come in a little bit below our total revenue for that segment even tough the comps were better than we expected. So it looks like the new store productivity had slipped a little bit. I don\u2019t know if you can talk about that, what maybe the drivers of that and then just secondly, should we remodeling unit growth in China next year similar to what you are doing this year because I think historically once you step it up, you have kept it at the higher rate, thanks?","Tim Jerzyk","Hey John, this is Tim Jerzyk. It\u2019s hard for us to understand exactly what you were expecting; we kind of give you our best thoughts on that even on the last call. I am not sure what you are expecting for Little Sheep. I know there were some discussions we have had with other analysts about the expectations from royalties from Little Sheep and it was a shorter than what had people expected. So that might be or where we were below what you expected. Our new store productivity has consistently been very much stable over the last five years, six years; it\u2019s about 30% less than our average unit volumes of our business net holding steady for both Pizza Hut and KFC. ","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Okay then on the development side?","David Novak","Okay, in terms of development outlook for next year? ","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Right, so we would be modeling similar unit openings in China for next year that you did this year?","David Novak","Well Jason, we will be providing that guidance at our December Analyst Conference as we had in years past.","Tim Jerzyk","Thanks Jason. Next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer","Two questions on the US business. Number one, as this big (inaudible) from the Doritos, Locos Tacos somewhat fades a bit at Taco Bell when can we expect you to come out with some more SKU\u2019s to sustain the momentum particularly the cool ranch which is something I am just really excited for and waiting for and then also just a very strong comps at Pizza Hut, if you can just talk about that do you think it is a result of a strong category in the quarter or there are something different you were doing in 3Q to take some significant market share?","David Novak","Well Brian, on the first piece, we are not going to give out the exact date, but we expect to have extensions of Doritos, Locos Tacos in next year and part of the reason we pushed that into 2013 was because we were so successful, it basically used all of our available supply of Taco shelves, but maybe you said coupon right before the positive come out since you are big fan of the product volume as well. Regarding Pizza Hut, we\u2019ve had pretty good success through the course of the last year on the boxes, so our box promotions have been very successful and we use those heavily in Q3 and we will probably continue to go on those going forward.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer","But do you think that the category was strong in the third quarter or I mean do you think a large part of kind of the upside in the comp was market share gains because of the box?","David Novak","Yeah, we haven't gone into some of the detailed pieces; I would say we didn\u2019t see a huge - the stuff I have seen, I haven't seen huge changes in overall category in the quarter.","Tim Jerzyk","Thanks Brian. Next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.","Andy Barish - Jefferies","Hey guys, can you talk about the inflation, particularly the food cost commodity side of things. It seems as if there is something more than just the raw material input cost using up a little bit. I wasn\u2019t aware of some of the changes in the U.S. distribution side of things or maybe it's more full priced product being sold, you know, DLT at $1.29 instead of a regular Taco. Can you give us a little bit more flavor or color on sort of that benefit for commodities and maybe an initial look at 2013?","Pat Grismer","Well, I\u2019ll certainly comment on 2012 again any guidance on 2013 will defer to our December Analyst Conference. As far as 2012 is concerned, we have seen significant benefit from what we call our restaurant margin initiatives focused on supply chain efficiencies. And you see that rolling through the U.S., so to recap what our quarterly commodity inflation trend has been in the U.S. Q1 at 4%, Q2 at 1% deflation, Q3 2% deflation, we\u2019re expecting for Q4, 1% deflation so you can see a nice trend there which to your point reflects not only what we\u2019re seeing is a general softening and commodities prices, but the added benefit of the supply chain efficiencies we\u2019re gaining through these initiatives. And that just takes us to flat on commodity inflation for the year, so its market price movement along with advantage we\u2019re gaining through our supply chain initiatives.","Rick Carucci","The supply chain initiative is a good example, but David has talked about quite a bit on some of the previous calls. We\u2019re doing a much better job of sharing, learning between divisions either between the U.S. and international or even within U.S. division. So this is actually initiative that was spearheaded by Pizza Hut that we\u2019ve now taken to the other U.S. businesses and now to other markets around the world. So we have a bottleneck consultant and just looked at how we could be more efficient in some of the supply chain opportunities that we had. And we\u2019re seeing some benefits of that this year and I expect to see some benefits for that next year as well.","Andy Barish - Jefferies","And any guess at selling more full priced product whether it\u2019s Taco Bell or China now kind of lapping the big value platforms that you put in place in 2011 in terms of the benefit of higher gross margins?","Rick Carucci","","Yeah, well obviously as you look at what we want to do in all of our brands in the U.S. and around the world, we\u2019re always looking at but what we call menu mix management and you know what you would take for pricing and how do you offer value to the consumers and what prices are your new initiatives. And we have benefited this year to the point that you are making as with Doritos Locos Tacos we think in some cases people are probably trading out of regular Tacos for those and those are priced at a higher level. And as we look at 2013, at least in one of our divisions that I have seen some detail, we probably will have more of our initiatives to say the higher priced items which should help us on menu mix. So we why make sure we could stay focused on core value in some of that main parts of our menu.","David Novak","I think one of the things that we are very pleased about in terms of our competitive positions with KFC, with Taco Bell and Pizza Hut in U.S. is that we are very competitive on everyday pricing basis. Taco Bell is renowned industry leader for price value and Pizza Hut with its $10 large pizza pricing structure that we continually reinforce is competitive on an everyday basis. So when you have that everyday pricing in place, when you come in on top of that with the innovation, you are able to do the menu management that Rick is really talking about. And that's a formula that we are going for all around the world, I mean it\u2019s we believe that low everyday pricing, entry pricing and then you innovate the heck out of the business and I think we do a pretty good job of that.","Tim Jerzyk","Thanks Andy. Next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","Great, thanks. Hey, just two quick ones. First is, how much of the China slowdown besides though I say the 200 basis point tougher compare is due more to the economy versus pricing; I mean what do you see as kind of the biggest factor there? And then just on the U.S. side, the Cantina product, it sounds like it\u2019s having some good momentum, is that due to more trading up or you are getting more new customers from that product?","Pat Grismer","On the China comps Greg, it\u2019s really difficult to segment the change quarter-over-quarter into how much is driven by the economy versus the comps and the comp is pretty clear. But we have acknowledged that there has been a slowing trend in the China economy and that\u2019s impacting the retail space broadly and we are feeling some effect of that.","David Novak","Regarding the Cantina Bell products, we don\u2019t have a lot of breakdown mathematically on new customer\u2019s etcetera; it\u2019s difficult to get QSR space. We do have anecdotally as a few things, first of all we are seeing more people at lunch time and that the people who buy Cantina products have higher ticket, which is obviously expected given the price point of the product. So we are seeing sort of that benefits on that products and you know we think that if that\u2019s casual guys, so it taught us a lesson which is that people want in a very high quality even food that are going spend more money if they get speed and convenience and obviously with the distribution that we have in restaurants around the country we are able to do that.","And one of the other things that\u2019s great about that product is that our team loves it. First of all, Lorena Garcia the chef who created a very, a professional personality and she has been very visible to the product launches to our chains through videos and personal appearances and the teams just loves serving the product and getting new customers. And the other anecdotal thing I would say is that our products are skewed a little bit more towards lunch and female customers; again that\u2019s anecdotal math behind that, but that\u2019s what we are hearing from our folks.","Rick Carucci","Just a little bit more perspective on China. I think when you think about the economic slowdown in China, think about our business in the context of that because keep in mind; we're overlapping 19% same-store sales growth with transaction growth of 27% during the third quarter of last year. So that\u2019s two years same-store sales growth of 26% and two years transaction growth of 26%. That\u2019s pretty amazing and then think about we\u2019ve added over 750 restaurants. So, I think immediately the economy is slowing down but when you look at our business performance in this environment, I think you would have to say it's the transient in any kind of economic headwind or whatever (inaudible) you would like to use.","Tim Jerzyk","Great. Next question please Ashley.","","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays","Just two follow-up questions. One, I know in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit Pat about the return of cash to shareholders, the balance between I guess repo and dividend. Just wondering one whether you would consider shifting that balance more from share purchase to perhaps pushing the dividend. I know it's currently just South of the 2% yield level and whether or not you would separately consider increasing leverage, obviously with rates where they are today and then just as a follow-up on the US talk about side of things. Just wondering whether you can give any kind of color in terms of the whether be the mix in terms of what you are selling or whether you think early read on (inaudible) in terms of mix or any kind of data points you can provide there. I know everyone focusing on Doritos and (inaudible) but perhaps if you are seeing broader strength that you think would be sustainable beyond those two products, any color would be great?","Pat Grismer","All right. Jeff I\u2019ll address the question on cash payouts. We\u2019re very happy with the mix of cash return that we\u2019re providing our shareholders today. We\u2019re delighted to taken up our dividend by 18% and to be on track to complete another year of significant share repurchases. In our view, this is a good mix. We do look on at our capital structure and determine whether or not a different approach is going to be better for shareholders. At this stage even given low borrowing rates, we don\u2019t think that it makes sense to lever up, to position ourselves to pay either higher dividend or to repurchase more shares. We believe that the strength of our operating cash and the growth in our cash flow year-over-year positions us well to continue to grow our dividend and to continue to accomplish significant with the share repurchases and there are no plans today to shift that strategy. But it is something that we do look at from time-to-time. ","David Novak","Regarding your question on mix at Taco Bell traditionally a lot of our product at a particular point time does come from new products that we introduced. The overall Taco mix has gone up considerably so we know that Doritos Locos Tacos piece has been was largely incremental when we launched it. And that\u2019s our total Taco mix is in the mid-teens to low 20s. So we took that up with the launch of the Doritos Locos Tacos. And that part is right now is having about a 7% mix or so. Cantina Bell is about a little under 5% mix right now. And obviously we want to grow that overtime.","Rick Carucci","Those are very high mixes for Taco Bell.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays","Okay. ","David Novak","The thing that we just came back from the franchise convention in Colorado, where we were celebrating the [58th] anniversary. I think the people are very excited, the franchises are excited about just the quality, ingredient to upgrade and the fact that we are seeing more up scale consumers and we are seeing more females as Rick pointed out. So this is something I think will build over time. I think one fact what is over 200 million Doritos Locos Tacos have been sold. So this is like, this is prior the most talked about product in our industry right now. I mean and people can't wait for the Doritos. And we really feel like Cantina Bell is just puts us into a whole rein of target and relevant and price value. I mean this product is third of the price for what you get at some of these places. Its two-thirds of the price and consumers recognize us. So we think that overtime.","Tim Jerzyk","Thanks, Jeff. Next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Elliott with Raymond James.","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","I guess, I just like to get your thoughts on the sort of reality of $7 to $8 corn for globally for 2013 and what you are thinking about that might mean both for purchasing power of your emerging consumers as well as obviously the cost of goods, so I just, I know you don't want to but make any specific comments about \u201813 but just few general thoughts on that significant issue?","David Novak","Well as you say Brian, it is a significant issue. It is relevant to our business. We will provide guidance at the December Investor Conference but just to provide a little bit of perspective over the years we have seen commodity peaks like this and we have dealt with them. We dealt with them through a combination of pricing and productivity measures and we don\u2019t expect that 2013 is going to be any different in that regard.","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","Do you see a risk to purchasing power given the percentage of sort of an emerging markets or percentage of income of those new middle class consumers that still goes to food overall potentially being a purchasing power decrease?","Rick Carucci","Nothing material but as you have heard say before in these emerging markets we are continuing to see expansion of the consuming class overall that will more than make up for any impact that might be for the purchasing power as the consequence of the shifting commodity prices. ","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","If I can sneak one more in and the YRI slow down was pretty meaningful from first half to third quarter across broad range of geographies, could you feel that back a little bit and is that average ticket, is it traffic, is it competition reducing increasing the amount of sales may be at about lower ticket or promoted items, just give us a sense of what the competitive landscape is there, how much of it may be competition versus consumer behavior change?","","Rick Carucci","I don\u2019t think competition has changed much. So I don\u2019t see that any of the changes is really due to that when you are looking on a total YRI basis, just do want to remind a couple of things that we did talk about is that Ramadan had about 1 point swing for the overall business. So on the emerging market business we said was plus 5% for the quarter, we think it had a 2 point impact; it wasn\u2019t clear from my comments with Ramadan moved forward in 2012, so we expect the bounce back in those markets in the fourth quarter and so far we\u2019ve actually seen that so and we gave Middle East as an example where we had big impact negatively in the third quarter. That will have an impact positively in the fourth quarter.","Tim Jerzyk","Thanks Brian. Next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. I wanted to revisit the China unit opening schedule question again. Two parts to it, one is, I understand you want to be cautious in terms of not out running your resources, but it looks like your history in China there has only been one year in last decade where you\u2019ve opened fewer units in a subsequent year versus a prior year that was a six. So why wouldn\u2019t so another 50 be the new run rate just based on that history and based on your willingness or desire to manage your business in a fairly constant level, but that\u2019s question number one?","And number two, and during these periods of rapid expansion or acceleration of unit growth, the question often comes up about new store productivity and the easiest way for us to measure that is just store volumes, not returns because we can\u2019t look at the cost as easily as you can, but just the store volumes. What factors are going to drive and move around the store volumes as we calculate them; in other words, are there in your six tier markets lower volumes, it doesn\u2019t look like from most recent materials, but if they are and then also, would there be brand make shift for example as Pizza Hut home delivery going to be a bigger piece of your unit openings next year and will that change volumes materially for the overall blended. If you can comment on those two, I appreciate it.","David Novak","Yeah John, I\u2019ll respond to the first piece with respect to new store volumes, to your very point, you know, we\u2019ve seen very high volumes in the lower tier cities. So any shift in the mix of development across the tiers is not going to have an impact to new store productivity. And the same would hold for brand mix shift; well, yes, we will be picking up the pace of pizza delivery or pizza home service development overtime; it\u2019s not going to be to an extent, but it\u2019s going to have a material impact to new store productivity.","And then as it relates to new unit openings, again, we\u2019ll provide guidance on next year at our December Analyst Conference. Certainly, given the pace of development this year and how we have grown our capability in China to support a new store program of this magnitude, it gives a lot of confidence that we have reached a new level, but we\u2019re not providing guidance on next year\u2019s development at this stage.","Rick Carucci","","John, we have our annual operating plan for China in the next couple of weeks and we\u2019ll go into more detail on this. But the message the team is going to be that and just keep building a quality business and the number will be what it is. But obviously, look we\u2019re not building this business to open up 750 restaurants a year. We want to get to over a 1,000 capability. So that\u2019s our \u2013 and we want to just keep getting bigger and bigger and better and better, but doing it the right way. So we\u2019ll give you more color at the upcoming meeting.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","And just you mentioned 1,000 units; over what timeframe do you think you require to get to 1,000 units a year?","David Novak","I don\u2019t know; sometime in my lifetime you know.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Rick Carucci","I\u2019ll have an answer to that; you know if you\u2019ve followed our company since the very beginning, we\u2019ve never really given a number and never really told people that we\u2019re going to try to get to that. But the whole thing has been build people capability so that we can grow, build the brands. Our brands, what gives you the ability to grow fast is when you\u2019ve got great brands with a great economic model which we do and I think the good news for us is that we still have less than three year cash on cash, cash payback. So we got a great, great business model.","And I think that the thing that gives us a lot of confidence is when you can match that business model with the people capability, you can do very amazing things like the team has done this year and I think that, we went into this year with a target I think of 600 and in the previous year, we had opened 656 okay and the number is going to be over 750. I kind of liked that approach to business; I would rather have a number that\u2019s going to force us to go through all the disciplines to make sure that we are doing the right things and then I would like to surprise you, okay, with performance that's the right kind of performance and that's kind of our approach.","So everybody has their own models and everybody builds their own kind of forecast and this stuff and we kind of layout what we layout, and you guys can do your own math, but we are trying to run the business on the basis of given our shareholders great returns and at the same time making sure we\u2019re building our brands the right way.","Tim Jerzyk","Thanks John. Next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research","Great, thanks very much and yes, I do have another question on China. I guess maybe, a lot of the questions are alluding to and I\u2019ll ask you in a separate way, is that with unit growth accelerating can maybe give us a sense of what the cannibalization factor may be has been in year\u2019s past and do you expect that cannibalization factor to increase or remain steady or perhaps even decrease just say over the next few quarters?","And then separately, just on KFC versus Pizza Hut, if you can give us what the comps were for each concept in the third quarter and it looks like maybe, is Pizza Hut maybe suffering more of a -- or having more of a slowdown than KFC and maybe how we should look at the outlook just given that Pizza Hut as a higher price point if perhaps KFC might potentially comp better than Pizza Hut has been comping a lot better than KFC over the past several quarters? Thank you.","Tim Jerzyk","Yeah Mitch this is Tim. Yeah, by brand it was six for KFC and eight for Pizza Hut in Q3, sorry we didn\u2019t put that in there; that was my call, because it was virtually identical I figured out it wasn\u2019t necessary, but clearly it is, so I\u2019ll be sure to put that in there from now on.","Cannibalization, a year in China for the investor conference, I think you\u2019ve got a sense for what we are doing and it think that they basically reiterated what so, where are we getting these additional new units that David was talking about with the 750 versus 600 target coming and 656 last year. It\u2019s really a lot of what [Lily Shay] our former CFO said last December and it was that government is building on infrastructure and they are building out this mega city clusters and we are getting more locations in the lower tier cities; there is more transport hubs which they identified had, identified in the presentation and then also Pizza Hut Casual Dining as we have been saying that\u2019s a new opportunity for us in going beyond Tier I and Tier II and which is what it had been pretty much up until like 18 months ago. ","We have actually opened up a 170, over 170 over the last four quarters of the Pizza Hut Casual Dining compared to 115 last year and by opening Tier III, IV and V to Pizza Hut Casual Dining that\u2019s basically almost a billion people that now we can add distribution to for that brand versus where it wasn\u2019t before.","In terms of the cannibalization, what we had said before was about one and five new stores of KFC had cannibalized in the past up to may be as much as 20% but I haven\u2019t seen anything lately on that, Mitch. I believe that my guess would be the numbers are a lot, is lower. Just because we're building so many more in new cities and we're building so many more Pizza Huts where the cannibalization factor is probably a lot less. So it was a factor maybe, three, four, five years ago but it's not really that much of a factor today and what it looks like.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research","I am sorry if you could just maybe just comment on the Pizza Hut comp versus KFC in terms of, it looks like Pizza Hut might be slowing on a year-over-year basis and maybe a faster pace than KFC, is that something that do you think we should expect given that the ticket is higher or is the fact that there is less competition for Pizza Hut that the out performance of Pizza Hut can continue or you think it can continue when you look at the outlook?","Tim Jerzyk","You know, I think for one thing, we can give more color but just to give you a little bit of a background on that, I think Pizza Hut had 11 straight quarters of double-digit same-store sales growth coming into this quarter and it's lap was even more significant than KFC in Q3, it was lapping like 30% growth over the past three years. So, yeah it just slowed down, but I mean those are still big numbers and I think importantly for us, which is what we\u2019ve been saying, it moves that brand into a very growth oriented position or now we can really grow this with great economics at least equal to KFC and the average unit volumes are comparable to KFC. So it's plus eight but it's lapping some big, big numbers over the last three years.","Thanks Mitch. Next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America","Thank you for bearing with us. A couple of questions on China and then one on food cost. So in China did the timing of the openings very much this quarter with a very backend loaded that would be my first question. And then secondly, the transaction count decline presumably it includes the benefits of breakfast and delivery in 24 hours. So when the core dayparts how significant with the transaction count decline. And then just a last one you talked about 4% pricing in China going into 2013, if food costs are moderating and if you\u2019re expecting to continue to moderate at least in the early part of next year, what sort of the rationale behind the pricing even so after transaction counts?","Tim Jerzyk","Joe, I\u2019m happy to respond here. In order starting with in the timing of openings, I don\u2019t know that the distribution of our new store openings this year is any different or materially different from last year. But with respect to the transaction decline I don\u2019t know what it is for core dayparts when you strip out the new sales layers. I really can\u2019t respond to that question.","And then finally with respect to next year\u2019s pricing versus inflation, as I said in my remarks or in a response to another question that we could take pricing next year there are no, there are no definite plans at this stage to do that. You are right that given what we\u2019re seeing by way of commodity deflation in China in the fourth quarter those trends will likely persist into at least the first half of next year.","So we\u2019ll provide more context to you at the December conference in terms of our views on same-store sales and how much pricing and when we might take it. But the fact is that the new pricing strategy that we implemented over the course of Q2 and into Q3 is one the China team is very happy with that increase the level of sophistication and we are able to go and segment their market and determine variable pricing and that will likely continue into next year.","Pat Grismer","Joe, on the transaction piece, just one point on that when I looked at the daypart mixes they didn't change. So while we don't have what the core was, it doesn't look like it was something in particular related to any particular daypart or core, that\u2019s the best I can tell from what I have seen.","","Tim Jerzyk","Thanks, Joe. Next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from R. J. Hottovy with Morningstar.","R. J. Hottovy - Morningstar","I just had one quick question and its kind of an ancillary question to the unit development growth that you are planning for the next couple years. How comfortable are you in terms of the unit growth with what we have seen in terms of bank and potential constraints for franchise financing right now. Just I wanted you to take on kind of the overall data on financing the franchisees at this point across YRI and potentially China as well? Thanks.","David Novak","Yeah. And we haven't seen any issues of getting access to credit for our international business, a lot of our international franchisees are pretty big players and they have been in the business for a while. So a lot of their growth they are able to fund through existing cash flows as well, so we don't see that as (inaudible) in anyway to our growth going forward.","Tim Jerzyk","Thanks, next question please Ashley.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Obviously, you guys have demonstrated I mean so much success in emerging markets and more examples necessary you mentioned China being the highlight. But then we look at developed markets, and so I wanted to really relate these two points as last year we talked about may be talking talk about refranchising being more down than what it had been in previous years, we are obviously success with the brand this year and it looks like talk about refranchising is all but about the stock. ","So of course the question in the US is one I put Taco Bell in the hands of franchisees when the economics are so strong and allow them to grow and develop the brand as really as franchisees can and then secondly, having been with McDonalds recently in Europe and studying their markets every year, the demographics in the competitive markets of France and especially Germany will repeat this being very good by a lot of people so I mean why not take that risk and put it solely in the hands of franchisees and pursue a rental model with all and in other words why not you pursue development in continental Europe on the peer capital way franchise model versus directly or indirectly investing your own capital?","David Novak","Let me then make sure I have the first part of this right and I will clarify my comments on refranchise. In the US we are basically done with our hitting our targets for KFC and Pizza Hut which we say we wanted to get down to about 5% ownership level in both of those brands and we are close to those, we will be close to those numbers actually now. On the Taco Bell side, our goal was to take the Taco Bell ownership level down from sort of the low 20\u2019s to about 60% by the end of next year. We are continuing along that path. So we have been doing modest refranchising for Taco Bell over the last year and a half we will continue that over the next year and half. So that\u2019s what we are doing on the US side.","Regarding the question on France and why would we pursue the business rental model versus franchising; the first piece of that we really did is that was delayed to get growth. When we were looking at France, the unit, the great news about France is that we have highest average volumes in the world. The bad news about France is its very expensive. So not that many franchisees, who, when you had the brand that was new in the market, you know, had several million dollars that they were able to put down on a new unit and what we found as we started the business rental model is we\u2019ve been very pleased with the quality of the franchisees. It is we maybe didn\u2019t have as best to as much capital what was required there.","So we found that we were happy with the way the restaurants were being operated. We believe we could have a big business there from an opportunity standpoint that we talked about before and you know we believe that we\u2019re having the right level of case of growth there. So we feel pretty good about how things are developing in France and we do have a few franchisees over there at the beginning and they are doing some growth at new units, but we expect a fair amount of our development to stay in the business rental model.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","And if I can ask Rick, in Germany, which is you perceived is being the more, competitive global QSR market, and might there be a shift you know overtime in both of those markets, to your pure franchise model when the franchisees get established and the economics get to be more proven?","Rick Carucci","We\u2019ll always look at what we think the right mix is between company; we will probably have all three there. We have some company ownership; there we have the business rental model and we have straight franchising. We probably continue to have the blend, continue to look at that overtime, but right now we're pretty happy with the current mix that we have.","David Novak","And maybe things for us, you know, on this John is how little of a business we have there already; I mean yes, we have now economics that we think are scalable. So I think that what we try to do is we try to learn from each other and we also try to learn from competition. And I think McDonalds has shown us that the business rental models are where you can expand with good returns over the long-term in continental Europe and I think we\u2019ve gone to school on that model and we think it can work for us.","And the good news for us is that we\u2019re just, we\u2019re really ground floor; we\u2019re ground floor on this. And we have a capital monitoring system that we put into place and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to monitor the unit economics. It\u2019s something says that we shouldn\u2019t be going that way we can always pullback. But right now we\u2019re really talking about our business, it\u2019s pretty insignificant that we think can become very significant and I think that\u2019s the real point for our shareholders.","I think it\u2019s upon us to really do whatever we can as Rick said to really grow the business and we think that the business rental model unlocks that growth for us and held a lot faster than if we were just working with the pure franchise business. Given where we\u2019re at, at such an embryonic stage and as to your point earlier is that if things change down the road, we can always look at the mix of our ownership. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve done throughout our history and I think pretty well.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","And with respect, there\u2019s an interesting contract is, okay I understand. Thank you.","Tim Jerzyk","We cannot give more colors and sorry. Next question please Ashley.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Jerzyk","We have only time for one question from you Sara. Sara?","Operator","And she has (inaudible).","Tim Jerzyk","","Okay, one more question please.","Operator","","Your next question is from Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse","","Thanks; a question for you either Pat or Rick. Can you please give us an update to the status of the efforts to sell the Pizza Hut UK business, and then just add to the little bit, does your guidance for what company restaurant margins at YRI might look like post site divestitures still remain intact especially given the strong margin performance of YRI this quarter, thanks?","Pat Grismer","Yes, we are in very active discussions with a buyer for the business and we remain optimistic that deal will close by the end of the year. And as we said before we expect that will or when we complete that refranchising that YRI will see two points of margin improvement. Now, you know how these deals go and it\u2019s possible that the deal could slip into early part in next year but we are optimistic that we will see close by the end of the year.","Rick Carucci","Yeah. As Pat said, we are in active negotiations where we believe it will close this year but we are going to have the right deal. So if slips into next year, we are okay with that too.","David Novak","Okay. Thank you all for being on the call. So let me rap up the Yum! Story overall, we are having another solid year and we are raising our full year EPS guidance to at least 13%, 11 straight years of least 13% EPS growth it\u2019s something that we really proud of, with record international unit development, we are confident on our future growth as well. So as we look at 2013 we are confident of our international businesses that are set up for continued growth and our US businesses on more solid putting to drive more consistent results going forward. ","We have track record to prove how powerful our growth model is, with the expected opening of 1,750 international units this year and our strategies in the based business, we definitely feel we are in good position for next year and expect to continue our track record of double-digit earnings growth in 2013 and beyond. We got our December analyst meeting coming up Investor Conference and we can\u2019t wait to sit down and talk to you about how we are in the ground floor of global growth China and a whole lot more. So, talk to you soon thanks.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"22819":["YUM! Brands, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Keith Siegner, Vice President, Investor Relations, M&A and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.","Keith Siegner","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO; David Gibbs, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Chris Turner, our Chief Financial Operating Officer; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from Greg, David and Chris, we\u2019ll open the call to questions.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.

First, all system sales results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Second, Pizza Hut Division and Worldwide system sales and net new unit growth include the benefit of the increase in units in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to our strategic alliance with Telepizza. Same-store sales growth reflects the inclusion of Telepizza in the prior year base.","Third, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and special items. Fourth, the lease accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1st, 2019. As a reminder, this is a GAAP required change, resulting in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We do not expect a change in our income statement or cash flows as a result of this accounting change. And last, please note that 2019 results will include a 53rd week.","We\u2019re broadcasting this call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback.

Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our Restricted Group capital structure will be provided at the time of the Form 10-Q filing. Fourth quarter 2019 earnings will be released on February 6, 2019, with a conference call on the same day.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed","Thank you, Keith. And good morning, everyone. Following a very strong first half and in line with our expectations, third quarter results were healthy and consistent with our long-term growth model.","Yum! delivered third quarter system sales growth of 8%, including 3% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. While we\u2019re pleased with our results, we know there is always work to be done.","I\u2019d like to begin today's call with a few opening remarks, before I hand it over to Chris, who will go over our third quarter results and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss our four growth drivers, Relevant Easy and Distinctive Brands as we say RED for short; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; and then some additional news on culture and talent.","Now to start at the top, I am confident that the Board and I have identified the best and most capable person to lead the next phase of growth for Yum!. We\u2019re delighted that David will officially take over as CEO in January. David has been a fantastic partner to me throughout our transformation these past few years. We\u2019ve always shared an unwavering belief in people, their development and our culture and we\u2019ll continue to invest in making Yum! the best place to work.","I am also immensely proud of the progress we've made by making both the Taco Bell and the KFC brands RED and accelerating the pace of global unit development. But, there is always unfinished business.","And for us that unfinished business includes consistently enhancing the customer experience by ensuring that we have the best people technology and assets. And this unfinished business is probably most pronounced at Pizza Hut U.S.","I am proud of Artie Starrs and his team as they continue to make significant progress on many aspects of the turnaround of this business, such as enhancing product quality, improving the speed of service, introducing a loyalty program and upgrading our technology over the past few years.","And as we announced last quarter, they are leaning in to accelerate the transition of our asset base to one base with modern delivery carryout assets while also moving aggressively to evolve our franchisee base, so that we can deliver a world class experience every time.","We know that some of our franchisees economics are pressured, particularly in higher wage markets. At the same time, others are overleveraged and some simply aren\u2019t the right operating partner for us to grow this brand. We know this transition won't be easy, but we are committed to doing the right thing for this iconic brand over the long-term.","To be clear, we have many existing Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees that have the capital, commitment and capability to bring the brand to life the right way and we will continue to support and partner with them on the brand turnaround.","Of course, this transition will undoubtedly lead to some disruption and choppiness in the short term, and I'm confident that Artie and his team are set to tackle this head on.","Now you want to leave the business better than you found it, but also with the knowledge it'll be better after you're gone, and that's exactly how I feel today. We\u2019ve accelerated growth while simultaneously executing a major transformation. And now nothing will give me more pleasure than to watch our brands and each of our employee and franchise partners go from strength to strength.","When I got the opportunity to serve as the CEO of Yum! starting in 2015, the goal was to lead our culture to fuel results and continue to build brands that people trust and champion, while driving aggressive unit expansion. This has always been and remains a foundational pillar for me.","We then built on this foundation with the separation of Yum! China in October 2016, which was a starting point of our three-year transformation. We became maniacal about being more focused, more franchised and more efficient to generate more growth and create a world with more Yum!.","We\u2019re confident we are well under way to accomplishing our 2016 transformation goals. We completed our refranchising program and are 98% franchised. We have demonstrated financial discipline by meeting our goal of G&A being 1.7% of system sales and by reducing run rate CapEx.","We\u2019re on track to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases between 2017 and 2019, and we've generated over 80% total shareholder return since we announced the transformation.","Additionally, we closed creative and transformative deals to drive profitable system sales growth for Yum! and our franchisees for years to come. We\u2019ve achieved healthy same-store sales and our pace of net new unit growth has nearly doubled since we announced our transformation in 2016.","Our work is not finished, but I am extremely proud and I believe the Yum! family is equally proud of what we have accomplished, and we\u2019re even more excited about our future growth potential.","And with that it gives me great pleasure to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Chris Turner.","Chris Turner","Thank you, Greg. And good morning, everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter results and our remaining transformation initiatives. To begin the results. Core operating profit grew 6% and as Greg mentioned Yum! delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 7%.","A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution with 3% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth driving 8% system sales growth in the quarter. Similarly, Taco Bell had another great quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% for both same-store sales and net new unit growth.","I\u2019ll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release.","First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses for marking to market our Grubhub investment. We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements is now a $0.12 headwind to the $3.75 figure.","This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast which will undoubtedly vary over time.","Year-to-date 2019 special items are a $0.02 tailwind and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.14 headwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.57.","Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our four growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I\u2019ll update you on our plans to be more efficient.","In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the third quarter. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged. For reference, details of our guidance are available on our website in the Investors section.","Regarding our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the three year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track.","During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $174 million at an average price per share below $115. When combined with dividends, we\u2019ve already returned $6 billion toward our target $6.5 billion to $7 billion.","Last but certainly not least, some updates on unrivaled culture and talent. Elevating our customer experience with digital and technology at the forefront is key to growing our brands. To that end, Clay Johnson has joined us as Yum!\u2019s Chief Digital and Technology Officer or CDTO; and Gavin Felder will be promoted to Yum! Chief Strategy Officer, effective December 1st. These newly created leadership positions will report to me and partner with our brands to accelerate global growth through technology and disruptive innovation.","Clay has over 20 years industry experience and comes to us from Walmart, where he served as CIO. In his new role as CDTO, Clay will oversee Yum!'s Global Technology Strategy partnering with our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell divisions.","He will lead a coordinated cross-brand effort to accelerate Yum!'s digital commerce strategy, data and analytics and emerging technologies to enhance the customer and employee experience.","Additionally he will provide strategic oversight to our global technology risk management and IT shared services teams. These critical connections will ensure that our technology implementations are developed with the security of our data and infrastructure as the top priority.","As Chief Strategy Officer, Gavin will be responsible for developing Yum! Brands' long-term corporate strategies and partnering closely with the global brand divisions to implement initiatives to unlock new sources of growth and disruptive innovation.","He will work closely with Clay to integrate technology-centric solutions across their operations including restaurant technology strategies to elevate the customer and team member experience.","Gavin is a successful digital leader and proven growth strategist. He started nearly 12 years ago in Yum! Restaurants International as a Finance Manager before becoming CFO of KFC Africa and later CFO of KFC Global. In his current role, Gavin has overseen strategy, digital and technology, financial planning, supply chain and IT security of our largest global brand.","With that I\u2019ll hand it off to our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs.","David Gibbs","Thank you Chris. We\u2019ll conclude our call today with an update on our on our growth drivers; relevant, easy and distinctive brands; bold restaurant development; unmatched franchise operating capability and unrivaled culture and talent. I'll start with our RED brands. KFC delivered its 17th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth.","This global powerhouse continues to show broad-based strength from standout -- with standout performances across many of our largest markets. This translated into division system sales growth of 8% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 6%.","International callouts include India, SOPAC, Latin America and our Russia business unit which includes Central and Eastern Europe. India delivered 7% same-store sales growth driven by distinctive marketing, promotion of the Zinger Burger and consistent value with the ultimate savings bucket. Australia continues to impress with 8% same-store sales growth, their best quarter in recent history.","Drivers included the successful Hot Rods promotion and delivery. Russia, Central and Eastern Europe posted a strong 7% same-store sales growth owing to a Bucket for $1 value promotion and the Finger Lickin' Good spin on a Taco -- Locos Tacos.","In the U.S. same-store sales declined 1% in the quarter. We had a temporary loss of momentum with the Chitos Sandwich promotion which led to the quarter's decline. However our value promotion of 2 for $6 Mix 'n' Match provided us with a new channel for \u00e0 la carte menu items and the quarter brought us many valuable insights to improve future performance.","We made a splash with plant-based fried chicken alternatives with Beyond Nuggets and Beyond Boneless Wings. The results were very positive. We sold out in five hours and generated $2 billion worth of media impressions - two billion media impressions.","Then at the end of the quarter, we launch Mac & Cheese Balls, which builds off of flavors you've already seen, but packaged in the unique KFC style. We're bullish on the future and are excited about our plans for the rest of 2019 and beyond.","In addition, KFC U.S. continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivery and click-and-collect. We officially launched online ordering at KFC.com on October 13 in conjunction with the introduction of Kentucky Fried Wings and our Rudy-inspired advertising.","We now have 2700 KFCs offering delivery in 3700 restaurants available for Click and Collect. We're excited about owning our own digital channel and the operation ease this provides our franchisees, while Grubhub takes care of the delivery.","Moving on to Pizza Hut where division system sales grew 7% with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 9%. Pizza Hut International system sales grew 14% in the quarter, driven by a nine-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year. While same-store sales growth was 1%.","Importantly, we reported positive system sales growth across all international business units during the quarter. In addition, we were encouraged by 3% same-store sales growth in the off-premise segment of our businesses this quarter, lapping similar 3% growth last year or 6% on a two-year basis.","The team is focused on the fundamentals of a modern delivery experience is clearly producing results and a good sign for the future of this business, as we migrate more and more to an asset based positioned to win in off-premise.","In addition, the system sales growth gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales narrowed from historical levels this quarter to three points, reducing the drag on our performance from dine-in.","In the U.S., system sales declined 2% with same-store sales declining 3% and a 1% net new unit decline. Coming off a solid second quarter, the Pizza Hut U.S. business decelerated in Q3 as changes to our value offerings helped franchisee margins, but had a negative impact on transactions.","In addition, our previously announced plans to accelerate the transition to a modern delivery asset base in the U.S., while restructuring and upgrading our franchisee base also took a toll on performance.","While we strongly believe that these are the right strategies to build the business for the longer term, these moves will introduce some uncertainty in the business performance over the short term, as we expect results to continue to be choppy. We caution, we could see a continuation of soft sales and unit contraction throughout 2020 in the Pizza Hut U.S. business.","Of course, we know that when we have great franchise operators running first-class assets that are well positioned in trade areas to serve customers, we win in the marketplace and the Pizza Hut U.S. team is working hard to accelerate this transition.","We continue to expand our Grubhub partnership test with Pizza Hut, which is now active in over 700 restaurants. Pizza Hut is well positioned to leverage being listed on the Grubhub marketplace, but by fulfilling delivery orders through our own delivery network. This gives us better control of the customer experience.","Last, but not least, Taco Bell where system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 4%. In the U.S., innovation and value continue to be cornerstones of our success. Promotions included Stake Reaper Ranch Fries and the return of the Triple Double Crunchwrap, both of which mixed above 9%.","But the triple Double was a sound out of the quarter available in a $5 box and a la carte. Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 6,100 restaurants and we launched localized AI-driven product recommendations to efficiently give our customers what they want.","TS [ph] results are encouraging with consistent check list and utilization. We see particularly consumer appeal in urban markets. In fact, in Manhattan, TS utilization is over 50% of our company cantinas.","Digital menu boards are offered in over 1,000 locations with the new simplified menu. Delivery is now live in 4,800 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 14 million registered users.","Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available nationwide on tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app. Internationally, we continue to build a category-of-one brand. We had strong sales momentum around the world driven by focus on iconic core products, value boxes at power price points and product innovation.","We saw widespread strength in the Philippines, Japan, Canada and Europe. We continue to strengthen global brand awareness by successfully incorporate U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. The UK ran Steal a Base, Steal a Taco promotion tied to the Major League Baseball London series generating strong media buzz and sales momentum.","Next on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 389 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last four quarters to 1,876. Excluding the Telepizza units added in fourth quarter of last year.","At KFC, development continued to be strong in Q3 with 317 net new units across 52 countries. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia and Thailand. In the U.S. we've seen more positive momentum and closed our Q3 with over 1,800 American Showman restaurants across the country.","At Pizza Hut, as we transition the U.S. asset base, we expect the pace of new unit development for the division to decelerate as healthy international unit growth will be offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. All in the division opened 17 net new units during the quarter.","Pizza Hut International opened 76 net new units with noteworthy contributions from Asia, Latin America, and Iberia. Taco Bell delivered 55 net new units during the quarter.","In the U.S. we opened four new urban style Cantina restaurants, hitting the 50 restaurant milestone. Recent urban Cantina openings include Chicago, San Jose, Champaign and Fort Lauderdale.","Internationally, Thailand launched a third store which is the first outside expat [ph] communities in Bangkok and China and Australia each opened their fifth location. We're continuing to build franchise development capability through events such as the Development Convention in Guatemala, a four-day event covering development principles and best practices to foster 3C Partners around the world.","Next Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. First I'd like to highlight a great executive team and myself had with Joey Wat and the Yum! China team earlier this month.","We were excited to learn about the work they're doing to lead innovation across many aspects of the business and as always we were incredibly impressed with their operational execution and overall focus on putting the customer first across all our brands.","At KFC, we've seen solid improvements across the board sharing improvement ideas and global best practices when it comes to ops-driven sales enablers. This is particularly the case when it comes to speed. Our franchisees in SOPAC created a competitive speed initiative called Best Friday which was then adopted by the U.K. to great success.","At Taco Bell, we're proud to announce this was our fastest Q3 in five years, which wouldn't have been possible without the commitment from over -- from our over 7000 general managers and their teams to deliver unrivaled fast and friendly service. Our summers speed challenge was a huge driver of this success. We were 17 seconds faster and saw three million more cars in our drive-through.","At Pizza Hut, we have successfully improved our system average delivery speed, which allows us to deliver hotter pizzas faster to our customers' door. While technology in data science have unlocked key insights, the credit goes to our restaurant leaders and drivers who have been implementing these at the store level to provide a Hot Fast and Reliable expense for our delivery customers.","Now to Unrivaled Culture and Talent, Yum!'s two biggest assets are our brands and our people. As we build a world's most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands, our culture continues to be a strength and is a key enabler of our continued success.","We recently completed our 2019 employee engagement survey of all corporate above restaurant employees globally and we scored number one on employee engagement among an elite benchmark of over 300 global companies. 95% of the corporate employees surveyed are proud to proud at Yum! and 91% believe our company is a great place to work. What\u2019s even more encouraging is that we have accomplished these results during a time of significant business transformation.","I\u2019d like to finish by saying, how excited I am and privileged I am to serve as the next CEO of Yum!. Under Greg's leadership, we have achieved so much already. Of course, there is still more we can achieve in the future. Everywhere we operate, we need to continue elevating and investing in a world-class customer experience with unrivaled talent modern assets and the best operations with disruptive and innovative technology.","This effort will only be realized through a strong partnership with our 2000 franchisees who run our restaurants and over 1.5 million restaurant team members who bring our brands to life around the world every day. When we are our best, we'll continue to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders.","Before we take your questions, I want to personally Greg for his tremendous leadership. As we all know, Greg's been making meaningful contributions to Yum! for the past 25 years. He's been fully committed to developing our talent, increasing our collaboration, elevating our brands and growing our business. Yet most importantly, Greg's vision to take Yum! 's unique recognition culture and use it to fuel even better results is what we will all remember.","It goes without saying that Greg's big personality and positive energy make him not only a great leader, but also one of the best partners and friends I could have had over the last many years.","There is no question that working with Greg day in and day out has helped prepare me for this next role and also given me a ton of laughs along the way. It's hard to believe that this will be Greg's last earnings call.","On behalf of the entire Yum! system, we want to sincerely thank him for the impact that he has made to our business. And we wish Greg and his wife Carol, the very best as they move into this new exciting chapter.","Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations Greg. And thanks for the funny accent along the way. Can we just talk a little bit about the Pizza Hut business and sort of your outlook?","One you talked about some disruption that maybe possible during this period of time, can you be specific about that? Is that sort of lower engagement and franchisees starting to be closing stores? Or what is the nature of that?","Two, is there an opportunity for the company again to sort of step in either as an intermediary or as provide some temporary support from advertising in some way to smooth this process better, because I think as you look out over 12 months you want to avoid obviously a disruption.","And three, I think there was a callout on the profits of the Pizza Hut business U.S. the drag your detraction from past due receivables, how big is that? And is that something we need to be cognizant of as we think about the next year or so? And does it impact the global core operating profit growth?","Greg Creed","Well, thanks John. And I too appreciate Greg's accent and we'll all miss it. As far as your three different questions, I'll take the first two and we'll let Chris talk a little bit about the receivables. As far as the disruption, as you can imagine when we\u2019re closing a lot of stores and opening new stores that can be an enormous distraction, particularly if we are taking the lead on transitioning franchisees out of the system and their stores into the hand of new players. Some of that will get to the receivables which Chris will talk about.","And also while transactions are taking place, obviously there's a focus issue in terms of where franchisees' focus is. As far as the company stepping in, and playing an active role in some of this, I wouldn't rule that out, but that's certainly not the plan now. The great thing about the Pizza Hut U.S. business is we have plenty of people that want to get into it and are eager to buy stores and invest capital into fixing those stores and relocating them.","So we see our role is more of a facilitator than we do as somebody to be buying stores given our asset-light model. But I do think there could be an opportunity at different points in time for us to take control of some stores as they transition to another party if that's a better way to approach it. So I wouldn't rule that out. And then I'll let Chris just talk a little bit about the receivables.","Chris Turner","Yes. John on the receivables side, clearly as you're being an outstanding franchise operator is one of our top priorities. And our stores do perform the best when we have committed capable and well capitalized franchisees.","As David just mentioned, we are working to evolve that Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee base and you did see noted that the past due receivables balance did have an impact.","But to put it in context, as we transition certain Pizza Hut franchisees, we will see an uptick in that bad debt. But again to put it in context, year-to-date we have reported about $200 million in fee income from our U.S. franchise system and over 95% of that we have either collected or anticipate collecting.","Obviously we'll try to minimize the choppiness as we go through this process, but we do believe that the work that we're doing will ultimately be the right thing to strengthen the brand and the overall system.","Keith Siegner","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS.","Dennis Geiger","Thanks. And Greg congratulations on your many years of success and best of luck. One question about technology. I guess given Yum!'s been at the forefront of investment in technology and analystics to really enhance operations over the last several years.","Just wondering if you could share some thoughts on the latest benefits that you're getting from those investments and partnerships whether it be Grubhub, QuikOrder, Collider and just how those experiences frame how you're thinking about additional investment opportunities or partnerships, particularly now with Clay in place a CDTO. Thanks.","David Gibbs","Well, look I would just highlight from a tech standpoint, we're proud of the work that we've done to-date, but there's a lot more to do. I think like a lot of companies, we have a healthy dissatisfaction in terms of our tech agenda and we're going after it much more aggressively.","And Chris can talk a little bit about that. As far as what we've done to-date, obviously, the QuikOrder transaction has worked out quite well. By bringing them in-house, we've been able to improve their capabilities and provide better services to our franchisees at lower costs.","The deal with Grubhub has given us great commercial terms for our franchisees and that's allowed us to uniformly launch delivery without having to push back that I think others may have seen both in Taco Bell and the KFC system.","But I know, with - one of the reasons, I'm very excited about Chris joining the team and Clay Johnson joining the team is these guys bring a lot to the tech discussion as well as Gavin Felder and I know they've got a lot of plans going forward.","Chris Turner","Yes. David, first, we do have the teams in place now, both strong technology leadership in each of our brands and geographies. And then the new additions that we mentioned earlier at the center and Clay Johnson supported by Gavin Felder.","Obviously, for competitive reasons, we can\u2019t go into a lot of detail on our future strategies. But just to give a little bit of color, I think there are probably three ways that we could advance technology.","One would be evaluating and considering potential acquisitions or investments in Technology Company\u2019s to help leverage our scale, bring those technologies to our stores and our franchisees.","Second could be commercial arrangements that we make with technology providers that give our franchisees advantaged economics and taking advantage of those technologies. And then third, given the strength of her team, we'll be developing internally proprietary technologies. So those will be the three ways that we can leverage scale in this area.","The areas that will be hunting in range across the full technology spectrum, but e-commerce, data and analytics and any innovations that improve the customer experience and the economics in our stores will clearly be at the forefront.","Keith Siegner","Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Thank you. I was hoping we could get maybe an early view on fiscal '20 development, whether we talk in terms of percentage growth by brand or absolute net restaurant growth by brand, I think it's important at this point to kind of think about whether KFC can maintain or even accelerate its pace as the first point.","Secondly, you've obviously made some fairly cautious total unit count comments around Pizza Hut, just want to get a little bit more clarification there. And then on Taco Bell, I think the comments were in the press release 67 gross units in 13 countries.","It\u2019s hard to drive scale at those kind of numbers internationally, but are we at the point now where Taco Bell can materially accelerate into 2020? And I'd like a follow-up as well.","David Gibbs","Yes. I mean as far as our unit count guidance, we don't historically provide guidance by brand. So I'll talk about Yum! in general. We've raised our guidance previously to 4% net unit growth. We still think that's a right number for the long term.","As we've highlighted on the last earnings call with leaning in on Pizza Hut that introduced a little bit more uncertainty into the pace of development. But we still think over the next few years, we will average that 4% unit growth number.","As far as Taco Bell, that's actually one of the areas that I think we're most excited about what's going on in international. We by choice focused on a few countries to try to get the pace of development really going in those countries.","So you highlight that it\u2019s 13 countries, but when you get a franchisees they sign up to build 600 units in India obviously that can make a meaningful step change to the pace of our development at Taco Bell internationally to just take one example.","But we will be expanding to additional countries over time. But I think we're really at the point where Taco Bell International development can start to become a more meaningful contributor to us.","And then, as far as KFC maintaining their lofty pace of development, we see no reason why that can't continue and the strength of that brand is something that I would just highlight for everybody on this earnings call.","It just continues to be widespread strength with clear brand positioning, a team that's really energized about the growth prospects ahead of us and absolutely believe in our ability to continue to grow and develop and accelerate the pace of KFC development.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the Pizza Hut U.S. Could you speak to that the financial health of the franchisees? There's been reports about NPC being in being in trouble. Their bonds are trading cheap here. Margin pressure seems to be a key seem across the system.","But what are your thoughts about what that specifically means not just to unit growth, but just getting things done to getting the value platform you want to place and just to overall how you're going to move forward in 2020 with that brand?","Greg Creed","Sure. As far as the pizza business, I wanted to make sure we all recognize that the Pizza Hut International business is performing quite well, starting to really deliver on some of the things that we\u2019ve been looking for out of that business in terms of moving to a modern delivery asset base. We talked about in the script the fact that they are plus 6% on the off-premise sales on a two-year basis plus 3% lapping a 3%.","All of that is a really good sign in terms of the strength of the Pizza Hut brand when it's executed by - in the market. The Pizza Hut U.S. business as we've talked about also previously has some unique challenges given the dining state and the conditions of the assets on the locations of those assets. So that's what we're trying to address by moving to a more modern delivery estate and setting the business up for long-term health.","Unfortunately a lot of franchisees or some franchisees have some debt that makes it hard to relocate those assets and that's where we're working through with those parties to get the stores in the hands of the right partners that are well capitalized to grow and build the business. It's not the majority of our franchisees. The majority of our franchisees are good partners and doing a nice job.","But as you know the QSR category is facing a lot of wage pressures right now and that is pressuring unit level economics and franchisees economics. But as we always remind people, building a new Pizza Hut is a good investment. The unit economics stand on themselves.","This is more about working through with select group of franchisees that may have more debt on their business than they should to get those stores capitalize properly and in the right hands of the right partners.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about aggregators. You had said that Pizza Hut is well positioned to benefit all of your brands, I think from the Grub partnership. But I guess could you give a little more color on that and in particular, the extent to which some of - sometimes what we're seeing is when restaurant companies have unlocked different ordering channels, there are back of house challenges and just because the production capacities maybe don't quite keep up with how the orders come in. So, that was the first part of the question.","And then the second was just a quick one on KFC and the Beyond Nuggets and the extent to which you view this as sort of sustainable versus a short-term very healthy list, but maybe less of the core part of the menu. Thanks.","David Gibbs","Yes. I guess on the question of aggregators obviously, we value our partnership with Grubhub and one of the key features of that partnership to your point Sara is that we integrated the technologies, so that the orders get past directly into our POS systems.","That wasn't easy. That was part of the reason. There was a delay in launch. But we think, that does give us a true competitive advantage over a lot of other people that are working with aggregators.","So we haven't really had issues that you're alluding to in terms of being able to get the orders to the stores accurately and then back out to the customer. As far as KFC and Beyond Nuggets, obviously we're all intrigued by plant-based meat alternatives and the success that we did with Beyond, the success of that test that we did with Beyond obviously is a good sign.","We\u2019ve done other test around the world. That\u2019s not the only one that we' done is the one that\u2019s garner the most press in the U.S. So you can expect more to come on that front. You saw just a couple of weeks ago Pizza Hut launched in the U.S. launched their compostable box and did so with the plant-based alternative meat topping. So, we think there is plenty of application for it, but more to come on that over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America.","Gregory Francfort","Hey. Thanks for the question. Greg, congrats on the retirement and David, congratulations on the new role. My question is just on G&A and you're now kind of running at where you kind of expected to get to a few years ago as a percent of system sales on G&A. And how do you expect this evolving over time as some of your bigger peers are making reinvestments in the technology side?","And do you think this is a line that you can continue to leverage? Or do you expect it to kind of flat line or maybe go up over time? I guess any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you.","David Gibbs","Thanks Gregory. Good question. As we come to the close on the transformation we've provided the 1.7% guidance for the transformation on G&A. You saw that this quarter we were at 1.6% and so we feel comfortable with how we're closing out the transformation from G&A perspective. There\u2019s been reset to a lower base.","I think going forward you could expect a more normal run rate trajectory on G&A. Given the lower base, there will be some timing differences that could create some lumpiness there and we will be investing in technology and other areas, but we do expect in general to get leverage on our sales growth over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations Greg and David. David, questions for you. We're completely post transformation now and I know you have strategic growth plans in place over multiple years that you gave say at your Analyst Day last December.","But as you take over as CEO, how do you put your stamp on this company over the next many years. Just anything philosophically on how you think about Yum! Brands under your leadership versus under Greg's.","For instance, are you open to making any changes in the portfolio through acquisitions or divestitures? Anything or any insight you can give us on how you're thinking moving forward? Thanks.","Greg Creed","Yes. Thanks Brian. Look, I think we're really excited that we're coming out of this transformation with a business that is stronger and better positioned to grow. That's to start. And that is very much due to Greg's leadership over the last five years, as I said in my prepared remarks.","Now that we\u2019ve got a better machine, we'd like to drive faster and grow faster. And I'll detail a lot of this as we get into 2020, but just to give you a preview. We've talked about this Recipe for Growth and how it's been fueling our growth over the last couple of years.","I think there is an opportunity to lean in further within the Recipe for Growth on the customer experience. We are not consistently executing the customer experience around the world to the standards that we have. We have pockets of excellence. We can be more consistent on that.","There is obviously an opportunity on technology which Chris talked about. And then there's an opportunity to better leverage our scale. I think now that we are more of a franchisor, less of an equity operator that gives us the ability to turn our focus to leveraging the scale on behalf of the entire system.","We organize in a better way to do that. I think you've seen more collaboration around world, again thanks to again thanks to Greg's leadership in dialing up the collaboration. All of that leads to an opportunity on scale. I do think that potentially could be something that would give us a benefit if we did an acquisition.","So, we don\u2019t need an acquisition to grow. Our brands today are strong generally around the world with plenty of growth opportunities, but we certainly wouldn't rule out an acquisition.","I think the other thing that you'll see us talk about is as we've talked a lot about the Recipe for Growth. At the same time, we've had what we called our Recipe for Good that our businesses are doing all around the world and their communities, around people planet and food. We\u2019ll talk more about that as we get into 2020 and the way we can dial up our communication on that and our efforts in that area.","Keith Siegner","Operator, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good morning. My congrats also to Greg for all you've accomplished at Yum! and David on your new role. My question's pretty simple. I guess just as it relates to the 2020 outlook or 2021 outlook, I am just wondering if you're still comfortable with the algorithms that you've laid out for growth in light of all the Pizza Hut challenges you're seeing.","And I guess secondarily, I guess how long do you think this Pizza Hut restructuring or transformations going to take to play out? Is it a one or two year plan? Or do you think it's longer than that? Thanks.","Greg Creed","As far as our guidance for 2020 and 2021, we'll talk a little bit more about that on the Q4 earnings call. But in general, we've put in place a long-term growth algorithm that we think we can achieve over the next several years and that's what our business is built for.","Certainly some challenges in Pizza Hut U.S. We've pressured that model but at the same time upside from Taco Bell, International growth and all of the other success that we're having around the world with KFC gives you confidence that we can overcome pressures to the model.","But again we\u2019ll talk more about that in Q4 when we get sort of our updates to the long-term growth model. Our plan is really to just provide you on an annual basis any onetime adjustment for the long-term growth model.","For example, this year we had a 53rd week. Next year, we'll be lapping the 53rd year. We'll provide you the guidance for what that means for 2019 -- for 2020.","David Gibbs","With that I am going to turn it back to Greg for some closing remarks.","Greg Creed","Thank you, David. So in closing, after 25 years with the company, today is my final earnings call. I've been blessed to work with and I've learned such I think much from such amazing individuals including our Board, our team members, our franchisees and our customers.","After five years as CEO, I feel really good about what we accomplished and what's next for Yum!. We've transformed the company and I truly believe that Yum! is stronger for all its stakeholders. And now I'm handing the reins to David. David's been an incredible partner and I'm looking forward to watching him lead.","Now finally, I want to thank you our investors and the analysts. Through the years, you've challenged us, asked the tough questions, gave your opinions and kept us sharp. You've made me a better leader and kept us sharp. You\u2019ve made me a better leader and Yum! a better company, and for all of that and your kind wishes today, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22952":["Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) Q4 2016 Earnings Call February  9, 2017  8:15 AM ET","Executives","Keith R.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO and David Gibbs, our President and CFO. Following remarks from Greg and David, we will open the call to questions.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements.

All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release, and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.

Brands, Inc.","Thank you Keith and good morning, everyone. Given the weather that I see in the Northeast this morning, I am pleased that you could join us today as we share with you a review of our results and discuss the future opportunities for Yum! Brands.","2016 was truly a landmark year. On October 31, we completed the spinoff of the China business. This marked the largest strategic initiative undertaken by Yum! since our spinoff from Pepsi 20 years ago. I'd like to recognize the work, effort, and diligence across the organization that enabled us to complete the spinoff on time and with such success. The spinoff and concurrent return of $6.2 billion to shareholders in 2016 concluded step one in our transformation.","We all want to extend a heartfelt congratulations to the Yum! China team on completing their first quarter as an independent public company. Micky, Ted, and the China team did a great job on their call Tuesday evening and we congratulate Joey on her promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer.","Step two of our transformation centers around executing our multiyear strategy to accelerate growth, reduce volatility and increase capital returns to shareholders. We are taking our franchise ownership to the next level and are on track to increase our franchise mix to at least 98% by the end of 2018. By the end of this transformation, we'll own less than 1,000 stores, reduce annual run rate capital expenditures to approximately $100 million and improve our efficiency by lowering G&A as a percent of system sales to 1.7%. In combination, these efforts will not only enable us to reduce the volatility of our cash flows, but improve absolute cash flow at the same time. I'm really happy to reaffirm the long-term targets we set out at our October investor and analyst conference, and I look forward to sharing highlights with you, as we progress.","Simultaneously, we're strengthening the foundation underlying each of our businesses, changing our mentality to align with our growth transformation and taking the necessary bold actions to position Yum! Brands for even stronger same-store sales and net new unit growth. These are the building blocks of shareholder value creation for a world-class franchisor. We're championing the customer experience like never before, and putting a fierce emphasis on building brands. The linchpin in all of this, of course, is our focused strategy. I'm a firm believer in the power of focus and believe that we can deliver long-term, sustainable results by honing in on the key drivers of our business.","Our four growth capabilities define every decision and action we undertake and make no mistake, they are driving our business every single day. We will win consistently by concentrating on being the best in the world with distinctive relevant brands, unmatched franchise operating capability, bold restaurant development and unrivaled culture and talent. I am energized to lead such a talented team that is spearheading tangible change across our organization. As we outlined at our October investor conference, we're building a stronger growth machine and are well on our way towards our bold goal of 7% annual system sales growth.","Now turning to our financial results, across many metrics, Yum! delivered a strong tier 2016. Core operating profit increased 27% in the quarter and 13% in the year. This exceeded both our October 2016 investor and analyst conference guidance and our long-term target of high single-digit annual growth.","Now with this in mind, let's review each division's results. First, KFC, whose consistent global performance is impressive. The division grew total system sales 7% in 2016, including the 53rd week, driven by 3% same-store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth. In the quarter, same-store sales grew 3% or 6% on a two-year stack and core operating profit grew 15%, including the 53rd week. Total system sales grew 8% in emerging markets for the year, with particular strength in Russia and Continental Europe. In international developed markets, total system sales grew 6% with strength in Canada, Australia and Continental Europe.","I'd like to point out that the U.S. continued its positive momentum, recording its 10th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. The team deserves a lot of credit for delivering remarkable fourth-quarter comps of plus 4% or plus 7% on a two-year stack despite difficult industry backdrop.","KFC global strategy to return to the fundamentals across the spectrum is paying off. Our strong pride in the core original recipe is at the center of everything we do and this translates to a focus on the basics in terms of recipe, a well-defined brand positioning, globally based on always original and clear value at memorable price points.","Innovation closest to the core is resonating with the consumer. Just look at Nashville Hot and the recently launched Georgia Gold. We did not change the form of our product, only the flavor profile and our customers love it.","As we look into 2017 and the future of KFC, I am encouraged by the opportunities we see worldwide. The brand is focused on convenience, making it easier to access KFC anyplace and in any way. For example, we are using flexible footprints, which increase the ease of unit development. With smaller asset types, we can build restaurants in places such as transportation hubs and urban centers. And KFC is also making a big push on the digital front in 2017 with self-ordering kiosks and a mobile site.","Finally, the brand is expanding delivery around the world. Our product has a very shareable occasion and travels incredibly well, which gives us confidence in the upside of this opportunity. In fact, delivery is the fastest growing channel in the business, and while we offer delivery out of more than 5,000 restaurants today, we plan to expand this even further.","Now turning to Pizza Hut, which grew total system sales 2% in 2016, including the 53rd week, driven by 2% net new unit growth, but offset by a 1% contraction in the same-store sales. Pizza Hut is a strong global brand, but the U.S. and international are two distinct stories. We're pleased that our international division is laying the groundwork for prolonged growth, and we're particularly invigorated by the team's ability to drive development.","Net new units grew 6% in 2016 and we expect continued growth as the development agreements signed last year take hold. You have already heard from Yum! China about its plans, but here are a few other examples. In 2016, we signed a substantial development agreement for Central and Eastern Europe. Separately, we signed a master franchise agreement in Australia, where we're excited our new partner opportunistically acquired another pizza chain, shortly thereafter will converge into Pizza Hut over time.","At the same time, we are implementing our repeatable model to spread best practices around the world. We've developed a strategy where we improve taste, experience and our value proposition all while clarifying our brand message in order to ensure profitable, strong, transaction-driven unit level economics. We are taking our learnings from the success of Thailand where we grew same-store sales at least 20% for three consecutive quarters in 2016 to other markets.","Korea, for example, has had several months of improvement. Malaysia is in the early days of success and others are implementing it, as we speak. We believe there is a significant opportunity for Pizza Hut International to accelerate top-line and unit growth, and look forward to delivering results consistent with these strategies.","On the other hand, Pizza Hut U.S., which is roughly 10% of total Yum! operating profit, is clearly in turnaround mode. The quarter's results disappointed and are not acceptable. We have undertaken an extensive study of the business utilizing outside experts and found a number of areas where we need to improve in order to take our fair share of growth in this market. These areas include improvements in the digital experience, delivery times, point-of-sale system simplification, and asset optimization, among others.","As with all turnarounds, this is a journey we need to undertake hand in hand with our franchise partners and will not be complete in 2017. We will share specifics of the plan in time as we implement them, but let me be clear, we see the market share opportunity in this category. We will execute initiatives across all aspects of the customer experience to capture our fair share and more, and I'm certain we have the ability and the determination to accomplish this. We've confronted challenges in all of our brands in the past and always overcome them. Most recently, we executed a successful turnaround of our U.S. KFC business, so stay tuned as we have more updates while we deliver on our plans.","And finally, Taco Bell delivered a solid 2016 with system sales growth of 6%, including the 53rd week, driven by net new unit growth of 3%, and same-store sales growth of 2%. Taco Bell continued to outperform the category in the fourth quarter, with same-store sales of 3% or 7% on a two-year stack. The brand's value-driven, innovation-focused model once again proved its merit and I'm pleased with the team's ability to deliver solid results, despite difficult industry conditions.","In the quarter, Taco Bell saw particular success with the $1 all day messaging and the rolled chicken tacos. As we look to 2017, we're energized by Taco Bell's high\/low value strategy and its innovative marketing calendar, including the $1 double stack tacos and the highly-anticipated Naked Chicken Chalupa, which is off to a great start.","On the international front, Taco Bell continues to build momentum. We opened 53 new restaurants, another record year of development. We saw strong fourth quarter same-store sales performance in Canada, Spain, and the Philippines. The brand launched in Brazil with five new stores in only three months and we're thrilled with the consumer enthusiasm for the Taco Bell in China, which recently opened and is off to a great start. In fact, I'll be visiting this critical market in March and we're already looking for ways to work together with Yum! China to accelerate the growth of Taco Bell going forward.","In closing, I'm excited about the future of Yum! and the plans we have to unlock shareholder value. KFC and Taco Bell sustained a category defying momentum from December into the new year, which gives me confidence in our 2017 guidance, which David will outline in a few minutes. Every brand is working to improve the key drivers of our business, same-store sales and net new units. We are more focused than ever on collaboration, brand building, and translating this to profitable results for the long term. The path is never linear, but we're relentlessly pursuing our vision of a world with more Yum!.","Now, before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment on behalf of everyone at Yum! to express our sympathy for Joe Buckley's family, friends, and colleagues at Bank of America and in the restaurant community. Joe will be sorely missed.","With that, David, over to you.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you Greg and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Greg's sentiments regarding Joe Buckley. Beginning with my days as a division CFO, I got to know many in the analyst community, including Joe. I always admired him and looked forward to our conversations. Not only did he have great industry insights, but he always had a smile and a kind word. All of us at Yum! felt this way and we send our condolences to his friends and family.","Today, I'll cover four areas in my following remarks. Our multi-year strategic transformation, our 2016 accomplishments and fourth-quarter operating results, our outlook for 2017 and an update on our refranchising and capital return plan.","I'll start by emphasizing what Greg said at the beginning of his remarks. We're on a journey towards becoming one of a kind, global franchisor with a highly attractive and predictable free cash flow growth profile. By the end of this transformation, we'll own less than 1,000 stores, reduce annual run rate capital expenditures to approximately $100 million, improve our efficiency by lowering G&A to 1.7% of system sales and increase free cash flow conversion to 100%.","As we shared at our October investor and analyst event, much of the EPS growth through 2019 comes from factors that are in our control; new unit growth, G&A reductions, refranchising efforts, and share buybacks. While our long-term guidance doesn't require our system sales growth to reach 7%, we're laying the groundwork to reach this bold goal with same-store sales and unit growth, only adding to my confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term guidance.","Now let's review what Yum! Brands achieved in 2016. First, we completed the spinoff of our China business. We're pleased that Yum! China is set up for success as a powerful, independent growth company, and look forward to maintaining our strong relationships with them as we both work towards our common goals. Second, we completed $6.9 billion of debt financing transactions at very attractive rates. The average rate in our total debt outstanding is approximately 4.75%, with an average maturity of eight years. 90% of our $9.1 billion of total debt outstanding is fixed. We're now managing a capital structure, which is levered in line with our target of five times EBITDA, and which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates, duration and flexibility.","Third, we returned over $6 billion to shareholders, including share repurchases and dividends, slightly ahead of our original plans. We bought back 58.8 million shares prior to spin at an average price of $83 and an additional 9.1 million shares post spin at an average price of $63. And as many of you have seen, we announced our first quarterly dividend as new Yum! with a target payout ratio of roughly 45% to 50% of net income. Last, but not least, we exceeded our new Yum! core operating profit growth guidance of 10%, as provided at our October investor and analyst conference. Core operating profit grew 13%, including the 53rd week, with a strong fourth quarter of profit growth across all our brands. Note all numbers we reference today assume a license fee from China for the entire year and are based on restated 2015 numbers to make the comparisons apples-to-apples. So 2016, really was an exceptional year.","Now let's take a high-level look at our fourth-quarter performance. We're pleased the Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 27% in the quarter, including the 53rd week. This was led by 27% growth at Taco Bell, 21% growth at Pizza Hut, and 15% growth at KFC. We were also pleased to see KFC and Taco Bell's third quarter outperformance of the category continue into the fourth quarter. As Greg already discussed, Pizza Hut International is gaining momentum and we are in the midst of executing a plan to turnaround the Pizza Hut U.S. business.","Overall, EPS from continuing operations before special items grew 19%, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from foreign currency changes.","Now I'd like to discuss our outlook. We're confident in our three-year plans and there's no change to our long-term guidance. Given an encouraging start to 2017 with continued momentum at Taco Bell and KFC, we see 2017 as a year where our underlying base business grows operating profits at a healthy high single-digit rate, entirely consistent with our three-year plan. Underpinning this high single-digit base operating profit growth, we're forecasting 2% to 3% global system-wide same-store sales growth and 3% global net new unit growth with each division increasing their pace of development compared to 2016.","Combined, we expect global system sales growth of at least 5%, excluding the impact of FX. CapEx is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. I want to note that given two discrete items, which I'll outline momentarily, our underlying high-single digit base operating profit growth will likely come in closer to mid-single-digits in 2017 on a reported core operating profit basis. As a reminder, core operating profit growth only excludes FX and special items.","First, the 53rd week lap is an approximate 1.5 percentage point drag on operating profit growth, just like it was a tailwind to our 2016 results. Second, we anticipate a mismatch in timing between lost profits from refranchising and the removal of associated G&A, which we expected heading into our transformation. This mismatch is purely timing-related and we estimate a headwind of approximately 1 to 2 percentage points to operating profit growth this year. This is particularly the case in international markets where the benefit of reduced expenses tied to refranchising can trail the actual sale of the restaurants. The magnitude of impact will vary depending on the pacing and sequencing of refranchising by brand and by market, and we'll update you as the year progresses. Again, this is calendar and timing, not base business results, and entirely consistent with our expectations and the plan we laid out in October.","Given the potential range of refranchising gains that could occur, we don't believe meaningful GAAP operating profit growth guidance can be provided at this time, as it is difficult to forecast when specific refranchising transactions might occur due to market and other conditions.","We continue to estimate that by completion of the strategic transformation, the overall impact of refranchising and G&A efficiencies on operating profit will be roughly neutral. And while there will likely be interim noise to operating profit owing to timing factors, operating margins, capital returns to shareholders, and free cash flow conversion all benefit immediately.","Switching to capital returns, over the next three years, we are committed to returning an additional $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We'll achieve this through a combination of refranchising proceeds, free cash flow generation, and maintaining our five times leverage. All in, we are targeting over $13.5 billion of capital return during our transformation, which spans from the fourth quarter of 2015, where we announced our intention to separate into two companies, through 2019 year-end.","Now, with regards to refranchising, we've committed to becoming at least 98% franchised by the end of 2018. As of the end of 2016, we were 93% franchised. During 2016, we refranchised 427 restaurants, excluding China. In the fourth quarter, specifically, we refranchised 232 stores, including 120 KFCs, 83 Pizza Huts, and 29 Taco Bells. We won't provide interim targets as we work towards reaching our new franchise mix of at least 98%. I remain extremely confident in our ability to deliver on our stated target by 2018 year-end.","Now, I'd like to talk about our capital structure. As part of our strategic transformation, we increased our leverage to about five times EBITDA last year. Should market conditions and\/or government policies potentially change, we'll optimize and refine our positioning to ensure we're making the best decisions for our business and stakeholders. But at this time, we're happy with our capital structure and remain committed to maintaining this leverage profile.","So to wrap things up, we are pleased with our accomplishments in 2016 and with the progress we've made to date on implementing our strategic transformation. Fourth-quarter operating profit growth was solid and ahead of expectations while the new year has gotten off to a good start for both Taco Bell and KFC. I'm very confident in the strength of our business model, and am certain we're taking the appropriate actions to ensure it optimizes shareholder value. We believe the disciplined decisions we're making today, coupled with the multiple actions taken in 2016, set us up for strength over the near and long term.","And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open.","Alexander J. Mergard - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, this is Alex on for John. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your fiscal 2019 EPS goal, and given significant FX headwinds and kind of the turnaround at Pizza Hut, is there any ability for you to flex a little bit more on G&A, perhaps below the 1.7% goal?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","As far as the 2019 target for EPS, obviously, there are some FX headwinds to that, that are setting us back, but our interest rate has come in a little bit better than we expected, so there'll be pluses and minuses as we go along the journey. And as far as our pressure on G&A, I'm really pleased that the organization has embraced our effort to get more efficient and we're certainly looking for G&A efficiencies continuously as we go forward on this journey, but at this time, our long-term guidance remains the same.","Alexander J. Mergard - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David, your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Just a follow-up on your comment on EPS growth first. If we look at your three-year target, and if we go out to that 3.75%, that's a lot of EPS growth relative to the comments you made on 2017. How do you think about 2018 and 2019 just conceptually in terms of growth versus 2017? And about unit growth specifically, you talked about a modest acceleration in 2017 on unit growth. How are you thinking about that and what are you doing to stimulate unit growth further? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Obviously, our bold goal, David, is 7% system sales growth and as David outlined, we believe we can get to 2% to 3% same-store sales growth next year and 3% development. I think what's very clear is that we are much more focused on these two. So, as I work with the leaders in the organization, I would say we've raised the awareness on the importance of net new unit growth, not just in the U.S., but outside. In that context, obviously, we had a very strong year at Taco Bell. Obviously, at KFC in the U.S., we've been a net closer. I believe that by the time we get to the end of 2019, we will be a net builder of new units at KFC, so I think that will be a turnaround.","We have signed significant development agreements with Pizza Hut International with a number of franchisees around the world. These are in the order of magnitude of 200 to 300 restaurants over like five years. And I think that on the KFC front, our ability to continue to penetrate in emerging markets remains. So I feel very good about our ability to continually grow our net new unit growth, and I think there's an equal focus on same-store sales growth, getting back to really understanding consumer insights, really getting to what makes the consumer different, and really understanding that what we're delivering is a food experience, not just food. And I think all of that will help us enormously. And so, I feel confident that I think we probably grew system sales around 4% last year. We are tithing at least 5% this year and I think we're definitely on our way to delivering close to the bold goal of 7% by the end of 2019.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Brian, your line is open.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Thanks very much. Kind of piggybacking on these questions around 2019 EPS, when you think about that plan to get there, you mentioned that you don't need 7% system wide sales growth to get there, even though that's one of your goals. So maybe you could talk about what is the system sales growth required given what you know today about all the financial controllables that you have much more certainty about. That's the first question.","The second question to Greg. I was just wondering if you can take a step back and maybe talk from a high level what you really think the biggest changes taking place within the Company are as you see it as you transform pretty rapidly here from an operating company to more of a franchise company. I mean I think we see all the external, but financial benefits obviously, but maybe you can touch on some of the other points and maybe why that is giving you the confidence in the acceleration in systemwide sales growth.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes, as far as the components of our journey to the 2019 EPS guidance, as we've said before, we're not going to get into specific details around sales guidance, for example, other than to just say that they're reasonable assumptions consistent with historical and our modest expectations for it going forward. I'll just remind everybody that share repurchases, things that are very much in our control, make up the vast majority of this journey, which is why we have confidence in being able to hit the targets.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes, and to answer the second question. I think there's really three things, Brian. I think the first one is we are much more focused as an organization. We are absolutely focused on driving same-store sales, net new unit and, obviously, shareholder returns. I think there's four areas that we are more focused in building distinct and relevant brands, obviously, enhancing our franchise capability, this bold asset development and unrivaled culture and talent. And internally, even as we did the 2017 AOP, it was very clear across all the divisions that they are more focused on these four things, which we believe will ultimately lead to stronger system sales growth.","I think the second thing is, we're running the organizations really through what I call a global leadership team. So, it's not just the Yum! executive team, but we meet monthly as a global leadership team, which is obviously the division CEOs and Presidents. And I think the last meeting, which we had two weeks ago, they remain incredibly confident and optimistic about both 2017, as well as hitting all the three-year transformation plans.","And then the last one is, we're going to have our first global leadership conference in five years in about a month. This will be bringing the top 200 leaders of the organization together. And essentially, the core of this meeting is about how do we go from good to great? How do we go from growing 5% system sales and get to 7%? And my objective is to use those 200 leaders to essentially be co-authors of this growth because we are going to have to do things differently. We are going to have to be bolder and I want them to co-author that sort of how. I know they are excited about it and I believe that we will leave with everyone having absolutely clear clarity on what we are doing on the focus that we are changing, and I think, hopefully bolder and more courageous decisions that will get us from sort of 4% to 5% system sales growth to the 7% number, which our bold goal.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara, your line is open.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about Pizza Hut, if I could, because, obviously, I think that's the one where you see the most opportunities to improve. But I guess you said, Pizza Hut is really a tale of two markets, but if I look even across globally, it is the softest business. So, my questions are what are the opportunities here? I mean are there specific markets that you could point to that really set a path and are very strong and where you could share best practices? And if you can't reaccelerate Pizza Hut, can you still deliver against your targets? Is there a strategy to refranchise that to 100%? Can you help sort of quantify the opportunities and challenges for that? Thank you.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Sure, Sara. So let me just say, I think we did deliver 6% net new unit growth in Pizza Hut International last year and I know the team because of the development agreements we've already signed, very, very confident that we continue to grow net new units in the Pizza Hut world. There are some very good examples, as you mentioned, about what we are calling the repeatable model. So in Thailand, we've turned that business around. I think we've delivered at least 18% sales growth for three quarters in a row. We've obviously captured what we've done there, and as I alluded in my remarks, taking that to Korea and Malaysia. I'm excited about the master franchise agreement that we've done in Australia. The results in Australia have improved markedly. I happened to meet with the master franchisee when I was there in December. I'm very impressed and I think that you will see both stronger same-store sales growth, as well as, as I said in my remarks, the opportunistic ability to acquire another pizza company and transform those assets into Pizza Hut.","So on the international side, I feel very good that we have captured the repeatable model, the things that work, and that we have an accelerating net new unit model in place.","In the U.S., I think it's very clear. In fact, the way I look at it, I go back to what is the underpinning of why Taco Bell had a pretty successful 10-year run and what is it that helped us turn around the U.S. KFC business? I think it's really two things. It's the partnership and relationship we have with the franchisees and that then leading to an aligned long-term strategy. And so, I think if you \u2013 if I look at Taco Bell, I think our relationship with our franchisees is world-class and that enables us not to be in a week-to-week, month-to-month planning cycle, but to be really looking at the long-term and have great sort of trajection. I think, as I said on the KFC U.S. turnaround, I think Jason Marker, and the team, they changed the relationship with the franchisees, and on the basis of that change in relationship, we've now got a much more long-term sort of strategic alignment.","On the Pizza Hut side, I think the good news is I know that both the franchisees and us want to replicate the results of both Taco Bell and KFC. I think both sides recognize that we need to improve the relationship and out of that relationship will become hopefully a more long-term aligned strategy. So, while there are many things to do at Pizza Hut, as we have talked about, there's assets, there's technology, there's operating systems, there's communication. I think fundamentally, when we get ourselves into an aligned long-term strategy that executes the plan, we know we've got a plan, then I believe we'll start to see an improvement in Pizza Hut. So I remain positive that we can do this. We know what's got to get done and I do believe our franchise partners at Pizza Hut want to be successful just as much as we do.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","And on the refranchising question, of the 427 units that we sold in 2016, 195 of those were U.S. Pizza Hut. So we have reduced our exposure to the U.S. Pizza Hut business a little bit. And certainly, as we go forward selling stores in Pizza Hut is part of our strategy along with the other brands. But I won't provide any more specifics on the go-forward plan, but we'll update you as we move forward on that.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John, your line is open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning. Greg, I wanted to ask you where you think delivery fits into the strategic priorities of the company right now. It's a global phenomenon across your brands and across other brands. Can you maybe sketch out how you think about it and the prioritization, how you think about it by brand and maybe where you are on a delivery percentage of sales or however you look at it by each brand and if there's countries where you are getting best learnings?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes, well, obviously, the Pizza Hut business is a delivery business and I think in the U.S., well, through delivery and carry out, more than 90% of the sales come from that now. So the other thing I'm really excited about is Roger's commitment to take KFC and make it more of a global delivery brand. As I said in the prepared remarks, we are already in 5,000 stores doing delivery. Obviously, we have over 20,000 KFCs. The great thing about KFC is it is perfectly set up to be delivered. There is nothing better than a bucket of Original Recipe chicken in terms of a transportation vehicle, product that holds its heat, delivers well. So, in that sense, I do believe, and I know Roger believes that accelerating delivery is a key part of it.","And on Taco Bell, obviously, Brian has started to roll out Taco Bell delivery. This product isn't as well set up to be delivered as the other two brands. But what is interesting is that when people want this product, they'll have it delivered. I think we're already in about 400 stores in the U.S. It's not a huge part of the business at the moment for Taco Bell. I know that Brian and the team are committed to accelerating that. Where we do have delivery, particularly around college towns, it can actually be, I think, about 4% or 5% of sales, but still a long way to go.","So, to answer your question, we're focused on it. We really have to turn Pizza Hut into a delivery brand. We're still probably well known as a dine-in brand, but the delivery brand is what we've got to change the consumer's perception. KFC, we're committed to growing delivery and we have a great product to deliver. And on Taco Bell, our customers want it; we're just going to work at how we get it to them. So, the answer is we're very focused on that, and that will be one of the drivers of growth.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","The only thing I would add is that Taco Bell is actually in over 900 stores with delivery now. And when you think about the Pizza Hut business, one of the challenges we have in the U.S. is more than half the stores are \u2013 have dining rooms attached to them and aren't really ideally set up for delivery. So that is \u2013 part of the journey at Pizza Hut is getting into more delivery-friendly assets over time.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And David, if I could just quickly follow up on G&A. I know there's going to be timing issues around refranchising in international, but you must have used the G&A number in your guidance for 2017 in the high-single digit or mid-single digit excluding these things. Can you give us some sense of where you think you are at the end of the year in G&A for 2017?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Here's what I'll say on the G&A front. If you look at what we've released in 2016, it looks like G&A went up about $60 million. But the reality is, if you back out special, it went down about $50 million. And that's before the effect of inflation. So, we had \u2013 we made some considerable progress on G&A in 2016.","In 2017, we've got a different mix of refranchising and G&A cuts that collectively is going to provide this 1 to 2 point headwind. But we're certainly on track with the plans that we had to get to the 2019 targets, and we're going to make meaningful progress on G&A in 2017, similar to the progress that we made in 2016.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Gregory, your line is open.","Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Just one quick clarification. On tax rate, I think the last update you guys had given was like a 26%, 27% tax rate for the new structure, but we are a little bit below that. Is that still the right number as we look out over the next couple years, or should we think about maybe a lower number?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","No, we believe that's the right number. Obviously, there's uncertainty on that as we're seeing potential changes in policy, but that is our current guidance.","Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just thinking about technology for the three brands, can you give an update on where you stand around common POS, digital ordering, potentially loyalty? Just sort of an update on the technology front for the different brands.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, on Pizza Hut, hopefully by the end of the year we'll be at a single POS system in the U.S., which will help enormously. Internationally, we're looking at getting out of multiple POS systems down maybe one or two, so that will help dramatically. Taco Bell is almost at a single POS and back-of-house system, which obviously sets them up for eCommerce, digital, social. And KFC is obviously also making progress to get to a more aligned one system. That will help us do things like loyalty, which obviously are critical and important in the marketplace. It sets us up to obviously drive the social agenda, and I think all of that will lead to improved growth to the business going forward.","Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is that more of a end of 2017 and then we start thinking about some of these initiatives kicking in in 2018 around loyalty and digital ordering as you think about sort of the outlook on timing?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I mean I think, well, obviously, Pizza Hut's got a very big digital ordering business today, but I think the opportunity for us to do loyalty and things like that will obviously happen once we get to this single POS system. Taco Bell already has mobile apps you can obviously order through. I think that business isn't large yet, but what it does do is actually make the brand a relevant brand. So, it's one of those things where we may not be getting a lot of business from -eCommerce on Taco Bell, it does actually reinforce that this is a millennial-centric brand. And then on KFC, yes, I think it's not going to happen any time soon, but we definitely know we need to be in the loyalty business. And so, whether it's late this year, next year, that's probably more the timing that things will occur.","Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you very much. I had one question and then one just reporting clarification. From a question standpoint, following up on the G&A discussion from earlier with the plans to reduce kind of to that 1.7% system sales, just wondering, as we think about the operating margins, kind of below that line, we've seen hundreds of basis points jump at each brand. Whether or not the brand is challenged or not, we've seen big jumps, which is obviously driven by the refranchising, but I am just wondering in terms of your insights, long-term goal by brand maybe, or maybe just at what point we reach a certain level where you say, you know what, it's hard to see that operating margin expand much beyond that. Just trying to see the pacing and sequencing of what appear to be very big jumps in the operating margin for each brand.","And then just from a reporting standpoint, just to make sure that we're all on the same page, I mean it looks like for the fourth quarter of 2016, you adjusted to reflect the pro forma, assuming Yum! China was a franchise model for the period, but we should do the same presumably for the prior three quarters of 2016? I mean I think you had an 8-K out there that gave the 3Q 2016 year-to-date, but just want to make sure I didn't miss anything in terms of the first three quarters separately, so quarter one, two, and three by segment restated as if China was a franchisee for the full year. Thanks.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Okay, Jeff, this is Keith. First, on the margin question, good question. And, yes, this is all consistent with the plan. Post the October investor and analyst event, we put a slide up that actually showed pro forma for the whole transformation to at least 98%. What our restaurant level and EBITDA margins and EBIT margins would look like on a baseline of 2015. So, if you look at that, you can actually see pretty explicitly where we think those margins can get to within a vacuum.","On the other front, yes, as I said in my introductory comments, we're going to get you pro forma results for the new fiscal year and for China, and we're shooting for early April. So, that will be full quarterly just like \u2013 look, I've been in your shoes and I know what you're looking for and what will be most useful. It is coming. We're shooting for early April.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I get it. I was under the impression from the press release that the adjustment you were giving by early April was just the realignment of the months versus kind of the periods you were using. I just want to make sure we are also talking about quarterly 2016, the first three quarters individually in terms of each quarter restated with China as a franchisee with the royalty payment coming in by segment.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, that's early April?","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Restated for everything.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So at this point, we should be taking the year-to-date we have for the third quarter and doing our best to just kind of cut it up to come up with the first three quarters of 2016 and applying it by segment?","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David, your line is open.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. My question is on the comps outlook for this year, 2% to 3% globally. That would be better than what you've been running in recent years, and in recent quarters. So just wondering what your degree of confidence in that outlook is as you sit here today and whether it requires some improvement at Pizza Hut or if you're assuming improvement in the other divisions.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thanks, David. It obviously is ahead of our run rate. As I think I said earlier, the organization is much more focused on two things, driving same-store sales and delivering net new units. So, I think just the amount of time we're spending on what do we need to do in order to deliver that growth, as we alluded to, obviously, both KFC and Taco Bell, took that sort of Q4 momentum into Q1. We've got the launch of Georgia Gold, you've got the launch of Naked Chicken Chalupa, and obviously, we've still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut. So, with the plans that we put together for the AOP, I feel really good about the plans across the brands, internationally, and in the U.S. It's nice to go into the quarter with some momentum. And I think this focus is really starting to pay off. And I'll be even more excited when we come out of the global management meeting and I've got the top 200 leaders to really help us think about what else could we do from a bold and courageous point of view in order to deliver even more same-store sales growth and even more net new unit growth. I'm really looking forward to that meeting because there's nothing better than being asked to co-author your own future.","So, I feel good about that. I feel good about the plans that the divisions presented in 2017, and now we've got to go and execute, which is what we've traditionally been very good at.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And Greg, thank you for that comment. Just to be clear, does the guidance this year or reaching the guidance this year require better performance out of Pizza Hut?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, I think, look, our performance will differ, obviously, across the three brands. So, in averaging 2% to 3%, I have expectations that maybe one brand will do better and one will do a little less and one will do about that number. So, I'm not expecting every brand to deliver that. I think the brands that have got momentum, we can build on that. And the brand that doesn't have momentum, we've got to do a lot of work. I sat down with the Pizza Hut U.S. team yesterday. We were reviewing calendar changes for this year, which obviously, they're working with the franchise community. So, no one is sort of sitting still either. If we are having success, we're trying to build on it. If we're not having success, we are acting quickly in order to change the trend.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Carla, your line is open.","Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I'm wondering if you could just give us the baseline number for the restricted group EBITDA. I know the financials you typically put on the website, but they're not up yet.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Carla, we don't have that number with us right now. Give me a call afterwards and we can discuss.","Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then one other question. Have you seen any impact on sales internationally as when we see news from Trump that's more domestic-focused or I guess that's causing any rift with international countries?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I think the easiest answer is no. I'm not seeing any impact anywhere. There's obviously a lot of discussion and speculation, but I'm not seeing any impact on our business in any country so far.","Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Hargreaves with Stifel. David, your line is open.","David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks. Yes, just to echo that last comment, if you guys could put restricted group EBITDA in the press release going forward since bondholders don't really \u2013 we've got a subordinated claim on Taco Bell performance. It would help a lot. It's hard to back into. Looking at the deltas in the cash from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, it was a big change and we will back into it in time, but I was just wondering if you could go over the major changes. It looks like you went from about $2.9 billion to $700 million. Could you talk about the big pieces there and then your comfort level with that cash balance? Thanks.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","David, this is Keith. On November 3, we filed an 8-K showing a pro forma end of 3Q balance sheet and cash flow statement for Yum! excluding China. What you'll see is a lot of the cash you just referenced in the $2.99 billion related to China. So, we show you actually what it was, excluding China, as of the end of 3Q. Then, if you do the walk from that number to what we show at the end of 4Q, largely that is one quarter of dividend and the share repurchases that were accomplished through the quarter, as we outlined in our press release. Give me a call afterwards and we can clarify, but that should be all the pieces you need to get through the walk.","David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","But the $700 million is pretty much what you'd expect to have going forward, more or less?","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","That's what we have now. Long term, in terms of cash needs, it's a little different now, given the moving pieces related to refranchising. We still have some company-operated stores. We do not need $700 million, as of now, and we'd like to knock that down over time. Historically, we've been in the $600 million to $700 million range, including China. So, it's less than that now. We'll update you as we get closer to run rate at the end of the transformation, but definitely less than the $700 million we have now.","David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Lastly, your 6.25% notes go current in March, so I'm just wondering if you're comfortable having those on the balance sheet till maturity or if you might deal with them proactively?","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","As we said, we're monitoring all market and macro conditions constantly, trying to make the best decision and get to the optimal mix of interest rate, duration and flexibility. As we said, we're comfortable with this \u2013 with our capital structure right now. If anything changes, we'll communicate that in due course.","David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Gentlemen, your last question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, guys, so much for taking me at the end. Thanks and for the third question for JPMorgan. The question is on Pizza Hut. In your press release, 47% of Pizza Hut sales are in the U.S. David, you made a really interesting comment that half of the units in the U.S. are dine-in assets and not really set up for delivery. So you kind of have a big chunky part of your business that's not really optimized for where the consumer is and probably where the consumer is going either. So can we talk about how to isolate that red roof asset, that dine-in asset that really does kind of complicate and make the difficulty of turning around the Pizza Hut brand very different than other platforms that exist that are delivery and carry out only?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Well, the good news, John, is that our Delco model, our small box model, is a really good economic model. The cash paybacks from building Delcos is three to four years, on average. So, we have a way to get out of those red-roof restaurants that are holding us back. And by the way, not all of them are sub-optimized for delivery. Some of them were built more recently. Some of our dine-in stores aren't even red-roofs; they were built with a newer model. So there's a mix of assets there. But we do have an economic way to get into a better asset and, Artie Starrs, the President of the Pizza Hut U.S. business is working with the franchisees on a plan to make that happen. And unlike a lot of transformations where you can introduce a new product overnight and it's a quick fix, this one takes a little bit of time.","We also have a fast-casual model, which we've talked about at previous investor meetings, which really plays into the current trend in the pizza category. We are seeing a lot of growth in fast casual. We've had a lot of success with that, albeit with a small number of units. And the franchisees and the Pizza Hut management team are excited about it and using that as another option to get into an asset that's better positioned for delivery, but also can add incremental sales through lunch day parts in this fast-casual model.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A couple of years ago, gosh, maybe it was five years ago, maybe more, you kind of drove a pretty significant contraction of KFC in the U.S. and at the back end of that contraction, you contributed some capital to KFC franchisees as well. I think it was related to ovens and maybe some other things. Do you think the Pizza Hut brand is kind of in that position where you make it a better brand, a smaller brand and perhaps you actually do step up and contribute either some OpEx or CapEx to the U.S. franchisee?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I think right now we are, obviously, having a lot of discussions with the U.S. franchisees, which Artie is leading. And I think until there's an outcome, I think, as I said earlier, I think the great thing is that the U.S. Pizza Hut franchisees, as much as we do, want to obviously turn the performance around and be more like KFC and Taco Bell in the U.S. They understand that it's going to require a partnership. They understand it's going to require long-term strategic alignment. And I think how that plays out in terms of what both sides do in order to build that relationship and get ourselves strategically aligned, that is sort of, I guess, work in progress. But I am very confident that both sides want to obviously get to a better place and get this brand back into growth.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. Thanks again, guys.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Greg Creed for closing remarks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","So, thanks, everybody, for being on the call. I guess for me 2016 was a landmark year. We successfully spun off Yum! China, we launched this multi-year transformation plan, and we returned $6.2 billion to shareholders. I'm very pleased with the results and a solid end to what, I think, was an extraordinary year. Core operating profit increased 27% in the quarter and 13% for the year, obviously exceeding our guidance. I remain very confident in our three-year plan. So, there's no change to our long-term guidance and I'm encouraged by the early progress we're doing to unlock growth through this sort of focused four growth drivers. We're off to a running start. I think we can accelerate growth, reduce volatility, and increase capital return to shareholders. So, I guess in summary, I'm very excited about the future of Yum! And I think we represent an extremely compelling growth story and one that investors, I hope, will buy into.","So, thanks for being on the call. Thanks for coming out in the horrible weather and we look forward to speaking to you all very soon. Thanks, again.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Investor Event. Our third quarter earnings will be released on Tuesday, October, 6.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed","Thank you Steve and good morning everyone. As you saw in our release yesterday, EPS in the second quarter while below prior year exceeded our original expectations. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made and have every reason to believe we\u2019ll deliver a strong second half and full year EPS of at least 10%.","Overall, I would summarize our second quarter performance as very similar to our first quarter results. Taco Bell is firing on all cylinders; KFC delivered another solid quarter; China continues to improve and while we are making progress, there is still much work to be done at Pizza Hut.","Let\u2019s start today\u2019s discussion with China. Same store sales continue to show steady but slower than expected progress. This quarter\u2019s 10% decline marks an improvement from the 12% decline last quarter despite a more difficult overlap.","There is no doubt in my mind that we will make a full recovery over the long term and return to historic average unit volumes. We have the two strongest brands in China by a wide margin, but frankly the recovery is taking longer than we would like. We need to be more aggressive, more innovative and much more disruptive to step change the business.","I\u2019ve challenged the China team to do all these things with a sense of urgency, because we know that when we step up our performance in China, our brands perform. So to be clear, we are 100% committed to not only recovering but growing our unit volumes in China. With overall customer metrics trending up we know we can achieve this, by sharpening our communications and bringing new excitement to our menu. We\u2019ve learnt from experience that we must innovate our way to recovery and that\u2019s just what we are going to do.","To this point in the second quarter we launched the first of two menu revamps at KFC. This consisted of eight new products focused on lunch and dinner. In addition to the traditional KFC offerings, this revamp included products aimed at consumers interested in healthy alternatives such as herbal tea and seafood.","We also recently launched our second menu revamp focused on breakfast. We know breakfast is an under developed day part for us in China comprising about 7% of sales. These two menu revamps provide new products throughout the day and give us a one, two punch of innovation we know our customers will love.","Additionally we continue to rollout our premium coffee. As of quarter end we offered our coffee in over 2,000 stores, providing an incremental sales lift of about a point for the stores offering coffee. The key to success in this business is grow existing or create new sales layers to build on. We\u2019re excited that premium coffee is already driving sales and profits, while giving us another platform to grow from going forward.","We\u2019re also making progress with digital marketing and our online delivery platform. We believe these initiatives make KFC even more contemporary maintaining a high degree of relevance to the Chinese consumer. In short, the KFC business we are building back will be based on new product innovation and balance nicely with everyday value anchors. We are continuing down the path to make KFC even more useful and contemporary. All of this is part of making China\u2019s number one foreign brand even more relevant going forward in an increasingly competitive market.","At Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China we continue to expand units at a high pace with great returns. Same store sales declined 4% in the quarter, but this marks an improvement from our first quarter performance and the brand is positioned for a strong second half.","We continue to leverage the asset throughout the day with the rollout of breakfast and our expansion into late night. We are also excited about Pizza Hut home service offering where we have nearly 300 units in China. Anyway you look at it; Pizza Hut in China has a long runway for growth ahead.","In conclusion, we are making continued progress in China and remain bullish on our long term prospects there. With cash paybacks of about 3 years, we are confidently investing in new unit expansion. We have leading brands and an enviable competitive position in the world\u2019s fastest growing economy. We expect to open 700 new units in China this year, and believe we can substantially expand our footprint over time.","Moving on to our KFC division, I am pleased to report the division continued to produce solid results. Same store sales grew 3% and the division opened 122 new international restaurants in 39 countries. Nearly 75% of these new restaurants were opened in emerging markets.","I\u2019m particularly pleased with the impressive growth we continue to see out of Russia where same store sales grew 14%. I travelled to Russia in May and I have to tell you, this is one of the most impressive teams we have anywhere in the world. The combination of brand positioning, operational excellence and product innovation gives me confidence that we will continue to win in this important market.","In developed markets, the UK and Australia once again posted impressive results with excellent same store sales growth. This is evidence that our KFC brand can deliver remarkable results in both emerging, as well as developed markets. I believe we can apply the same strategy such as breakthrough product innovation, compelling value and world class operations, which are propelling these businesses to other developed markets. Just think how our results would be transformed if we could achieve Australia\u2019s 2.3 million average unit volumes in all of our markets.","Now turning to the Pizza Hut division; same store sales were even in the quarter, but trends in the U.S. sales improved across the quarter. We complemented our innovation focus with compelling value offerings such as any medium pairs for $6.99 and the $12.99 Big Dipper Pizza, which provided momentum.","We also continue to make strides around driving more digital sales. For example, home meal replacement digital orders were 42% up 10 percentage points from the second quarter of 2014. As we discussed last quarter, we are working to attract new millennial customers with our Flavor of Now menu, while also providing our loyal mainstream customers with their favorites. I firmly believe Pizza Hut has enormous potential that recent results do not reflect.","We are intently working to become more competitive. Turning around these results will not happen overnight, but through our focus on value, our assets, digital and messaging, we are relentlessly working on realizing the full potential of our brand. We are encouraged that Pizza at international continues to develop at a high rate and we expect record international expansion this year, laying the groundwork for future growth.","Last but not least, Taco Bell. I am very pleased with the results out of the division this quarter. Same store sales grew 6%, operating profit increased 29% and we opened 58 new restaurants. Keep in mind we launched breakfast at Taco Bell in the second quarter of 2014. So this marks that first quarter we are lapping breakfast. With breakfast at 7% of mix, restaurant margin exceeding 20% and a flourishing innovation pipeline, I am confident that we\u2019ll see continued positive momentum going forward.","Taco Bell\u2019s goal is to be America\u2019s favorite millennial brand and we are making substantial strides to deliver on that aspiration. For example, we just announced we are expanding our delivery testing with DoorDash in select locations. I\u2019m delighted with the strong initial test results and this is just another example of Taco Bell proving it is on the cutting edge of QSR.","Taco Bell International continues to build awareness and improve its economic model. Same store sales grew 7% in the quarter with particularly strong performance in Latin America and Canada. We have now opened 18 new restaurants this year, including four with open kitchen formats. We are still in the first innings of international expansion for Taco Bell, but I know that this one day will become our third global brand.","So in conclusion, we have multiple opportunities for growth across each YUM! division. We are making continued progress in China. Taco Bell is going from strength to strength. KFC continues to build on its momentum and Pizza Hut is in turnaround mode.","I could not be more thrilled to lead this company into the next phase of growth. Our brand building agenda led by consumer insights is underway in driving our brand and product position. As I mentioned last call, we recently acquired the Collider Lab to help elevate this agenda. I\u2019m especially pleased with how Kaleida has intergraded its thinking into each brand to improve our insight driven marketing.","I am also pleased that Pizza Hut team has added expertise in big data analytics. This is allowing the brand to segment customers in ways we\u2019ve not done before that should lead to more effecting marketing going forward and in a true the YUM! fashion, we are planning to spread this knowhow throughout the organization.","Since assuming my current role I\u2019ve been on the road visiting many of our international markets. To say I like what I\u2019ve seen would be an understatement. I\u2019ve walked away from each visit grateful that I\u2019ve inherited such a strong business with great franchise partners, fantastic leaders and the potential for enormous growth. Of course everywhere I go I see opportunities to improve our company, but I\u2019m confident that our band building focus combined with the technology innovation, marketing and operation efforts underway will help unlock this potential.","Now some of you may want to ask today about our views around corporate structuring related to our China division, including a shareholder suggestion that was well publicized this quarter. We don\u2019t plan to discuss that and distract from our second quarter results. But we want you to know this, the YUM! Board of Directors regularly review strategic options to optimizing long term shareholder value, including those involving corporate structure. We routinely dialog with shareholders, listen to their ideas and thoroughly evaluate those, which maybe in our shareholders\u2019 best interest.","In any event, our top priority is to get our China business back on track and we are making steady progress as evidenced by our first and second quarter results. As we\u2019ve discussed, we expect to have a strong second half of the year based on continued progress in China and fully expect YUM! to deliver at least 10% EPS growth in 2015.","In summary, we are in a unique position at YUM! with three distinct brands that we will strengthen and grow into three iconic global brands that people trust and champion. We remain focused the three keys to driving shareholder value; same store sales growth, new unit development and generating high returns on invested capital. I believe this combination of efforts will enable us to reestablish our track record of consistently delivering double digit EPS growth in 2015 and the years ahead.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn things over to Pat.","Pat Grismer","Thank you Greg and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our second quarter results and share perspective on our full year outlook. For the second quarter as Greg mentioned, our results were very similar to Q1. Earnings per share excluding special items decreased 5%. This was substantially better than the decline we had originally estimated.","I\u2019m pleased with the quality of this upside as it was led by better than expected restaurant margins at KFC China and outstanding sales and margin performance at Taco Bell. With the continued progress we are expecting in China, we remain confident that we\u2019ll have a strong second half and deliver at least 10% EPS growth this year.","Reported EPS declined 28% in the quarter. This includes a $68 million non-cash special item charge related to our decision to sell Mexico real-estate, negatively impacting reported EPS by $0.13 in the quarter. This item reduced our ex special tax rate by approximately 2 percentage points benefiting ex special EPS growth by 3 percentage points this quarter.","Now I\u2019d like to provide some color on our second quarter results by division. In China operating profit declined 25% prior to foreign currency translation, led by a same store sales decrease of 10%, which was sequentially better than Q1\u2019s performance despite a more challenging lap. Restaurant margins were 14.6% in a seasonally low quarter. This was 2.2 percentage points lower than last year\u2019s Q2, yet it was a significant improvement from the 4.5 percentage point decline we saw in the first quarter demonstrating continued progress. The margin decline resulted from transaction deleverage and inflation, partially offset by pricing and labor productivity.","Our team in China continued to do an outstanding job of driving restaurant operating efficiency through our improved store level sales forecasting and better labor scheduling. Importantly they accomplished this while maintaining our high standards of customer service. This continues to bolster our belief that China division restaurant margins will return to the 20% range as sales recover and that this recovery has the potential to unlock approximately $600 million of operating profit from our existing store base alone.","In addition to the profit leverage we will realize as sales recover, we continue to open new units with confidence, which is a key driver of future growth. We opened 80 new restaurants in the second quarter bringing our first half total to 251 new units in China. We continue to shift our new unit development towards higher return investments, as we are more selective in Tier I and Tier II cities and continue to upweight development in Tier III through Tier VI cities.","Similarly we continue to shift more of our new unit development to Pizza Casual Dining, which generates our strongest returns in China. Based on the results we are seeing in these new restaurants, we are confident that these investments will yield strong returns and we remain on target to open 700 new restaurants this year.","Now moving to our KFC Global division which posted another solid quarter with growth in sales, margin and profit. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets, up 12% before foreign exchange led by Russia, Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth, up 5% before foreign exchange led by Australia, the UK and Western Europe. And KFC in the U.S. delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of solid same-store sales growth with comps up 3%.","Division operating margin increased 1.3 percentage points in the quarter to 21.9%, driven by same store sales growth, franchise led new unit development and stronger restaurant level margins across the board. And while increased advertising expense related to our ongoing U.S. turnaround program impacted the divisions profit by 2 percentage points in the quarter, KFC global\u2019s operating profit still grew 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","An important element of this is robust franchise led international development as KFC opened 122 new international restaurants in the quarter and is on pace to set a new record this year opening 700 new international restaurants outside of China and India, including a recent new market opening in Myanmar, demonstrating the strength and broad appeal of this iconic global brand.","Same store sales were even for our Pizza Hut Global division with growth of 2% in emerging markets and 1% in the U.S. and a decline of 2% in international developed markets. Division operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 22.6% as strategic growth investments in international G&A offset improved restaurant margins which benefited from lower cheese costs. While sales were even with last year and short of expectations, we are confident we are making the right investments to improve Pizza Hut\u2019s overall brand position operations and digital experience globally.","New unit development continues to be a bright spot for Pizza Hut as the division opened 101 new restaurants in the second quarter, including 66 new international restaurants. Franchisees opened 92% of these new international units underscoring their confidence in the brand. We are confident we will have another year of record development with about 550 new international restaurants in 2015.","And finally, Taco Bell posted another exceptionally strong quarter with same store sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin of 23%, which is more than 5 points better than Q2 of last year. As a result, operating margin increased 4.7 percentage points to 29.5% lifting operating profit by 29% versus prior year. We could not be more pleased with the performance of our Taco Bell team and their continued focus on category leading innovation across every aspect of their business.","This obviously includes our new breakfast layer increased to a very healthy 7% sales mix. Additionally we opened 58 new restaurants in the second quarter with nearly 90% opened by franchisees and are well on our way to opening at least 150 net new restaurants this year with international development accelerating in the years to come. Anyway you look at it, Taco Bell is a powerhouse brand with outstanding momentum.","Now I\u2019d like to shift gears and talk about our full year outlook. We fully expect to deliver EPS growth of at least 10% this year. Given our first half EPS decline of 7%, we\u2019ll need nearly 30% EPS growth in the second half of the year to reach this target. We believe this is achievable. The key to this EPS bounce back is a sales recovery in China and we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll deliver solidly positive sales numbers going forward, especially as we lap the supplier incident from July 20 of last year.","I\u2019m extremely confident that as sales return, profits will flow through nicely, given the continuous cost management initiatives we\u2019ve seen through our first half. With first half China restaurant margin already over 16%, we now expect full year restaurant margin to be closer to 17%. As a reminder, 60% of China\u2019s operating profit historically is earned in the second half of their fiscal year, which includes seven of 12 months.","Outside of China we expect KFC to have another solid year and Pizza Hut to fall well short of its ongoing growth target despite the improving results we expect in the balance of the year. For Taco Bell, although we expect solid performance in the balance of the year, we expect much more moderate profit growth as we overlap stronger sales and margin performance from last year.","I do want to point out foreign currency translation remains a strong headwind as we continue to expect this to impact full year EPS by about 5 percentage points. However, this impact is included in our EPS forecast of at least 10% growth. To be clear, this exposure is one of the profit translations and does not impact our ability to price our products competitively around the world.","So if you step back and think about how 2015 is developing, it\u2019s very consistent with our expectation coming into the year, which is a negative first half followed by a very strong second half driven by China and importantly, we continue to invest behind the business, opening 2,100 new international restaurants in 2015. Outside of China approximately 90% of our new units will be opened by our franchise partners.","So let me wrap things up. We\u2019re pleased that our second quarter results were stronger than expected due to robust performance at Taco Bell, as well as the continued recovery in China. We expect at least 10% EPS growth this year with a very strong second half.","And with that, I\u2019ll open up the line to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Tarantino with R. W. Baird. Your line is open.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. My question is on the China sales recovery and I guess first part is how would you frame up your current expectation for comps for the year now. I think last quarter your point was the low end of your 3% to 7% guidance. So I just wanted to understand what you\u2019re thinking now and then specifically you mentioned that the recovery is going I guess slower than expected. So could you talk about maybe why you think that\u2019s the case and whether you think its macro related or more specific to the brand metrics that you\u2019re seeing?","Pat Grismer","David, this is Pat. I\u2019ll take the first part of your question and Greg will respond to the second part. So as to our expectations for full year, same store sales growth in China, at this stage of the year it still remains difficult to call. We\u2019ll certainly keep you updated as the year progresses, but certainly based on everything we\u2019ve seen to date and our forecast balance of the year, full year same store sales growth in China could be in the low single digits.","We do expect both KFC and Pizza Hut same store sales growth to turn strongly positive as we lap the initial impact of the OSI publicity later this month. This will fuel a strong second half for China and enable us to deliver EPS growth of at least 10% for the year.","Now I\u2019d also point out that from a profit perspective stronger than expected margin performance has offset the impact of the slower than expected sales recovery in China and we expect that this will continue through the balance of the year, thereby preserving our overall profit outlook.","Greg Creed","So David, let me answer the second part of that question. I think the good news is that sales are recovering. We went from minus 12 to minus 10 despite a more difficult lap of plus 15. The good news is that the consumer metrics are improving trending in the right direction. As always, these are never linear unfortunately, but we do know that we compare this to previous recoveries. We\u2019re going in the right direction, making progress across the board. So I feel good and we remain obviously bullish on China. We continue to invest in China and I think as you know, these customer metrics are the harbinger of future sales performance. So I think with all that said, we remain very bullish and confident and continue to invest.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks David. Next question please Jona.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","Thank you very much. A follow up on that and then maybe an addition as well. Could you diagnose why specifically you think China was below your own expectations in the second quarter, especially given the customer metrics which have been trending up throughout the year?","And secondly, it is clear that with it being a little bit below your expectations and perhaps a tweak down in the comps in China for 2015, it is interesting to juxtapose that with the China margin numbers going up. So just a philosophical question is, why not reinvest some of that margin to regain the traffic or in other words, how confident are you that the focus on margin is in a reason in and of itself why comps might be slightly below expectations.","Greg Creed","Yes, I think the slower than expected recovery \u2013 remember we\u2019ve had two safety issues, which we\u2019ve never had before alright, so we\u2019ve never been able to model two safety issues and there\u2019s obviously some slowness in recovering that. But there\u2019s been no impact on our customer metrics as we measure from an operating point of view and so I think in that sense we are going to continue to push aggressively.","We need to be more innovative and the way I look at it is, with where we are today, Pat\u2019s giving you the right guidance, but we\u2019ve still got six months of the year to go and right now what I\u2019m trying to do is aggressively bring outside ideas from YUM! into China. As we said earlier, we\u2019ve got really a number of that KFC businesses on file, whether that\u2019s Russia, the UK, Australia or South Africa and I think there\u2019s a number of product innovations, there\u2019s a number of valued plays that those markets have played and I\u2019m very confident that we can bring those to bear.","And that said, I still expect a strong second half in China. Sales will go positive, we will continue to make progress and I think we can bring the power of YUM! to bear by taking those ideas from those powerhouse countries and have China test those.","Pat Grismer","And John, this is Pat. I\u2019ll just add a couple of other comments, which is that we feel very good about the productivity gains that the team has made in China. We believe that they are sustainable as Greg mentioned. They\u2019ve not impacted customer service levels and frankly what they\u2019ve effectively done is strengthen the underlying unit level economics, which not only gives us continued confidence to invest at the rate that we are behind new unit development, but also reinforces our belief that as sales recovers that we\u2019ll see significant profit leverage in the business.","Greg Creed","Yes, I mean if I was to make one last comment I\u2019d say we need to balance value with innovation and there is no doubt innovating our way out of this is the best way to do and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to stay focused on.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks John. Jona, our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass","Thanks. Good morning. First on China comps, yes so the recent decline in the Chinese stock market had any impact on sales. Do you notice a correlation there at all?","Pat Grismer","We don\u2019t. John, this is Pat. John we don\u2019t see a correlation. We think actually a very small percentage of customers have been impacted by that as to whether or not it is impacted broader consumer confidence, we have no reason to believe it at this stage if that is the case.","John Glass","Greg, if I could ask one more. Greg, you did open up and you talked about the possibility of this China spin notion. I know you don\u2019t want it to be a distraction. Do you view that as a distraction in and of itself for the recovery of China, so that you might want to wait till China recovers before entertaining that idea?","Greg Creed","I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we don\u2019t want to talk about it. Obviously we review our shareholder proposals, but I can assure you the China team is focused on one thing; their number one priority and my number one priority is getting China sales back into sort of stronger growth.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks John. Jona the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane Geissler","Good morning.","Greg Creed","Good morning.","Diane Geissler","So is it safe to assume that you've kept your guidance for the full year at at least 10% EPS growth because of the uncertainty around the China comp. Is that the biggest holdback despite the fact that the margin is so much better than you expected. And then also \u2013 I\u2019m going to let you answer that first.","Pat Grismer","Hi Diana. This is Pat. Happy to respond to that question. I think what your implying is that maybe the full year guidance is conservative and I would say absolutely not and I do want to put it in perspective, because you have to bear in mind that we\u2019re at that midpoint of our year. EPS is down 7% and as I said in my prepared remarks earlier, to achieve full year growth of at least 10%, EPS needs to grow nearly 30% in the second half of the year and I don\u2019t think of that as an overly conservative number.","Obviously it's heavily dependent on the results of our China division where profits were down about 30% in the first half of the year, and in order for China to deliver on its expected share of second half EPS growth, second half profits there need to be more than double of what they were last year. But we\u2019re confident China can deliver this result, but with 60% of their profits being generated in the second half, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent to adopt a more aggressive stance and lean in on this.","Additionally as I mentioned, foreign exchange headwinds are much stronger than we had originally estimated, but this is factored into our overall EPS guidance. So I just want to make it very clear, we expect to have a strong second half based on continued progress in China and we fully expect to deliver at least 10% EPS growth for the year.","Diane Geissler","Okay, thank you and then I wanted to ask on the comments about the new unit mix leaning more heavily on lower tier cities and also into the Pizza Hut franchise and home delivery. Can you talk a little bit about your development expectations for this year and even into next year in terms of what we should be thinking about KFC versus Pizza Hut versus Pizza Hut Home Delivery and then higher tier cities versus lower tier cities? Just trying to kind of frame that up.","Pat Grismer","Certainly Diane. As I mentioned, our capital investment follows returns and so where we generate the higher returns is where we\u2019re directing more of our capital spending. That has been the case for the last few years and just to put it in perspective, for the quarter 60% or 62% of KFC new unit openings were in Tier III and below cities. Back in 2012 that number was 53%. So you\u2019ve seen a pretty significant shift there and then as it relates to Pizza Hut Casual Dining for the quarter, that business accounted for 35% of total division new unit openings. In 2012 that number was 24%. You can expect that those trends will continue, because again that\u2019s where we see the stronger returns and our capital investment will follow the returns.","I\u2019m not going to give preliminary guidance for 2016 as it relates to either number of units or the mix of units, but I will tell you that we\u2019ll continue to direct more of our capital investment money towards the higher return opportunities, which at the moment are with Pizza Casual Dining and for the KFC business in the lower tier cities.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Diane.","Diane Geissler","Thank you.","Pat Grismer","Next question please Jona.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer","Thanks. Could we talk a little bit about the marketing and menu news from China in particular and how do you think that new menu is performing at KFC China and any data points would be helpful with the impact to your marketing, even as we look into 3Q. Thanks.","Greg Creed","Yes, I think as we said David, obviously we saw sequential improvement from minus 12 to minus 10. The new menu items are accounting for that 15% of sales, so they certainly got traction with the customers. I think that\u2019s also another good data point and I think the consumer metrics continue to show improvement. So I think you look at our continuous improvement. You look at the percentage of mix from these new items and you look at the continued improvement in our consumer metrics and I think that all bodes well. As Pat has said that we will have a strong second half. We will go into positive same store sales growth and I remain completely confident.","Now can we take ideas from around the world between now and the end of the year and test those? Yes. Do I still have the sense of urgency? Yes. Could we do things more speedy? Yes. So as you probably expect, that\u2019s occurring and that\u2019s why we\u2019re at the half year mark and there\u2019s still plenty of time for us to still evolve and tinker with the calendar between now and the end of the year.","David Palmer","Is there anything specific that you learned that you think weren\u2019t tweaking that you could call out from the first half; things that worked and didn\u2019t work?","Greg Creed","The other way I look at it, there\u2019s some great products outside of China that are doing very well, whether it\u2019s the UK, Australia, South Africa or Russia. So what I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve put the China team obviously in direct contact with those businesses and I know that a number of those ideas are currently being contested in China as we speak. So it\u2019s been more that I\u2019ve seen some really powerful ideas outside of China that I think have relevance in China and then I\u2019d really ask the China team to concept test those and if necessary we\u2019ll make changes to the calendar in the back half of the year.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks David. Jona, next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Joseph Buckley","Thank you. A couple of questions on China as well. Do you think that the slower than expected sales trend, do you still relate it to the Shanghai Husi Incident or you think its related to broader things happening in China, whether competitively or just somewhat slower growth.","Pat Grismer","Joe, this is Pat. I think it is fair to say that what the brand or the brands are recovering from is the incident from last year, because that\u2019s what had the dramatic impact to sales starting in the middle of last year and we are continuing to recover from that.","I think it\u2019s also fair to say as we have said on previous calls and at our investor conference that the environment in China has changed in terms of becoming more competitive and so consumers do have more choice. That has raised the bar on us to innovate more than we have in the past, to keep pace with changing Chinese consumer and to continue to move even more aggressively on things like digital. So I think it is fait to say that the environment has changed, but that we are changing in response to that.","Greg Creed","And just if I can build on that Joe, we have markets that are much more competitive than China that we compete in and we compete very successfully and so again we can use YUM! now to share where we\u2019ve been very successful, in markets that have even probably two or three time the amount of competition. We can bring that knowhow to bear, to help the China team as they obviously move to more rapidly improve this out performance.","Joseph Buckley","Do you have a sense of what the Chinese restaurant market as a whole is doing? Has that slowed significantly also?","Greg Creed","I don\u2019t. I mean that\u2019s \u2013 no I don\u2019t have\u2026","Pat Grismer","No, I mean I think that generally the economy is growing at a slower pace. So it\u2019s fair to say that and that that is putting pressure on retail generally. I think we also need to bear in mind that with GDP growing this year at around 7%, it remains the fastest growing large economy in the world.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Joe. Next question please Jona.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Bittner","Thanks very much. My question is I think I\u2019m just a little confused on why there is kind of a tone change in the way you\u2019re talking about how sales are tracking versus your expectations. Just because your gains for the second quarter was for a sequential improvement, you did that. We haven\u2019t even started lapping the July 20 fall off in the business yet. That comes in a week. Is there\u2019s something that\u2019s happened say in June since the quarter end that\u2019s causing the tone change or were you expectations for the quarter just a significant sequential improvement relative to what occurred.","Pat Grismer","Brian, this is Pat. Nothing specific that has changed to drive that. Just as we step back and we look at the performance in the first half of the year, it\u2019s fair to say that same store sales while recovering, haven\u2019t been recovering at the pace that we had originally anticipated. Thankfully we are seeing that offset through improved productivity in the stores and those margin gains are therefore muting the profit impact of this lower than expected sales recovery.","But make no mistake, the sales recovery is happening, not only based on what we see in terms of same store sales and the fact that in the second quarter we lapped a harder comp, so we got sequential improvement on top of lapping a harder comp. But also based on what we see in our key consumer metrics, which as Greg mentioned are a leading indicator of where sales will go. But we felt that it was important to acknowledge that sales are progressing at a slower than expected pace and that is factored into our full year EPS guidance of at least 10%.","Greg Creed","But I think I want to make sure everyone understands, we still expect a very strong second half and that we will deliver at least 10% for the full year.","Brian Bittner","And you also mentioned \u2013 am I still here with you guys?","Steve Schmitt","Yes, go ahead Brian.","Brian Bittner","You also mentioned that same store sales in China could be low singles for the year, which would still imply double digit comps in the second half. Is the confidence behind that just the way the core trends accelerated from the first and second quarter, like on a two and three year basis, because that\u2019s what ultimately gives you the most confidence in double digit one year comps in the second half.","Pat Grismer","Well, you\u2019re right that we do expect the very strong same store sales growth in the second half, particularly as we lapped last year\u2019s OSI incident and there are multiple indicators that substantiate this view; one year, two year, three year, four year comps for KFC. We look at absolute transaction volumes on a de-seasonalized basis, we look at key consumer metrics, which again are all moving in the right direction. So all of that together giving us confidence that we\u2019ll get the second half bounce back necessary to achieve the profit growth objectives in China, which underpin at least 10% EPS growth for the year.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Brian. Jana, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason West from Credit Suisse. Your line is opened.","Jason West","Yes, thanks guys. I\u2019m not sure how much you\u2019re willing to talk about the other structural ideas, but the idea of recapitalizing the balance sheet has come up, particularly given the substantial franchise assets you guys have and I\u2019m just wondering, if you could give your updated thoughts on that particular as you move towards sort of a 95% franchise mix outside of China. Does that start to change your thinking around the capital structure and then also looking at what\u2019s happening across some of your franchise peers? Thanks.","Pat Grismer","Jason, this is Pat. No change to our policy, which is to optimize our capital structure based on what we believe is in the best interest of shareholders, which is to maintain that low investment grade credit rating and so our policy hasn\u2019t changed and no specific guidance as to what that capital structure might look like when we complete the three year refranchising program we announced in December.","Jason West","Okay, but even as a more franchise business you would still like to keep that in investment grade.","Pat Grismer","Well, we look at our capital structure from an enterprise perspective. We don\u2019t segment our balance sheet according to one part of the business versus another. So we have to bear in mind that in our China business we have a substantial equity presence with all of the operating leases, which function as virtual debt if you will, which plays into how we optimize our overall capital structure for our shareholders.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Jason. Jana, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Karen Short","Hi, just a couple of questions on Pizza Hut. So I guess you\u2019ve taken some aggressive stances with your value positioning more recently, but I guess it doesn\u2019t seem to be resonating with the customer or maybe asked another way, do you think it\u2019s a value issue, a trial issue, a frequency issue or anything else, because obviously your peers are generally doing extremely well.","Greg Creed","Yes, Karen, thank you for asking a non-China question. In all seriousness, if our peers actually are performing, I think there is no one silver bullet to this solution. You saw us in the quarter playing at more stronger value which actually over the quarter did show improvement across the quarter\u2019s performance and I expect that to continue going into the second half of the year. But this is a sort of total relook, which is we have to have assets to be upgraded. We have to have the compelling value, we have to have compelling innovations, we have to deliver superior experience. We have to improve our e-commerce digital experience. So there\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s got to get done.","I\u2019m very confident in the team that\u2019s in place to make that happen. We\u2019ve got some new people onto the team in Pizza Hut, so we\u2019ve invested in areas like digital, marketing, food innovation, e-commerce. As we said on the call, we\u2019re actually getting into big data analytics and we\u2019re really starting to see some early signs of \u2013 I think that will help us position the brand better and actually really understand where the business has gone to.","So it\u2019s holistic, we\u2019re on it, we\u2019ve brought people into it. I\u2019m very comfortable and happy with the leadership that we\u2019ve got in place to deliver on it. We\u2019re not happy with the progress, but we are making progress and I think you\u2019ll see us continuing to make more progress as the year unfolds.","Karen Short","Great. Thanks.","Greg Creed","Thanks Karen.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Karen. Next question Jana please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great, thank you very much. Just unfortunately I wanted to get back on China for a second. Two things; one just on the comp. I\u2019m wondering as you looked at it perhaps slightly below expectation, whether you see it, maybe this performance by market or day card or weekend, weekday, I\u2019m just wondering as you slice that down 10%, which we can\u2019t do, is there any particular area of concern.","Another question was just broadly on the positioning of the brand. I think most recently it kind of was focused a little bit more premium with motions and what not. I\u2019m just wondering whether the recent challenge is digital once again, maybe broaden that out, focus a little on value to retain that lower income consumer. Thanks.","Pat Grismer","Hi Jeffery, this is Pat. I\u2019ll respond to your first question and Greg will answer the second. First, with respect to what we\u2019re seeing in the comps and whether when you look at various lengths of segmenting that we\u2019re seeing material differences, the only thing I would highlight is that we are seeing stronger performance in our Tier I cities at both brands. It seems that the Tier I consumers are less phased by the supplier publicity this time around and I would say that that\u2019s especially encouraging, because that\u2019s where we have a higher concentration of stores and also face the strongest competition. So I think that\u2019s further evidence of our brands ongoing recovery and resilience.","There are some regional economies that are more dependent on industrial production and they are feeling more pressure from slower economic growth and we are seeing the effects of that in weaker sales performance in those regions, particularly in some lower tier cities and in response to that KFCs recently launched regional promotions with 10 RMB Burger to help stimulate traffic. That\u2019s the only thing that really bears mentioning in terms of any variations in comps across the entire market.","Greg Creed","So just to talk about the positioning, I think yes, we probably have to find a better balance between innovation and value. Again, if I go back to the KFC markets that are really outperforming, whether it\u2019s Russia, Australia, South Africa or the UK, what you will see in those markets is we have great entry price points, we have great value for money, we have really chicken focused innovation and we are really doing disruptive things in the markets place. So, I think that \u2013 and then we have, I guess it also goes without saying we have great leaders running those business as well.","So I think that we are going to have to find more balance, but I am very confident that we can find that balance and I am very confident that we have got the ideas and resources around YUM! in order to accomplish that.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Jeff. Next question please Jana.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Senatore","Thank you. I have two follow-up questions. One is about Pizza Hut and one is, not to belabor the point, also about China. So on Pizza Hut, could you just talk about the developed markets outside the U.S. and in particular diagnose maybe are the issues the same out there, is it stepped up competition, digital value marketing. Just so I kind of understand, because it feels like broadly the brand sort of stepped back a little back in the last couple of quarters.","And then the follow-up on China is really one about timing. And I guess you laid out sort of $600 million in EBITDA which is a big number, but its less impressive as it takes 5 years to materialize and so do you have internally a sense of at what point you decide, okay this business may not go back to peak volumes and likewise, how long do you decide when you are looking at strategic alternatives, how long do you give yourselves to make decisions. So I\u2019m just trying to frame timing from both fundamental and strategic standpoints.","Greg Creed","Let me answer the first part of the question. I think with our Pizza business, strong U.S. \u2013 I\u2019ll say strong global business, there is no doubt about that. So having said that, I think that outside the United States our assets are in much better shape than they are in the United States, but I do think in terms of things like value, e-commerce and digital we need to accelerate our progress in those areas. So I think our assets are in great shape, I think our food quality is in great shape. I think the food innovation is in great shape, but there is no doubt that I think value, as well as the whole customer experience and e-commence are areas that we need to make sure we remain competitive and as leaders in those places.","Pat Grismer","And Sara, this is Pat. I\u2019ll respond to your second quarter as to the timing around recovering the $600 million in EBITDA. We\u2019ve never been specific as to a timeframe for that. What I want to let you know however is that we are absolutely confident that the business will return to those 2012 peak average unit volumes and we are absolutely confident based on the progress the team has made to improve unit level economics that as the sales recover there will be significant profit flow through on the sales.","As to the timing of that, it\u2019s tough to call and I\u2019m not going to make a prediction based on that, nor am I going to talk about how that may play into the timing of any structural moves. Because our top priority regardless of what we do structurally is to bring that business back in terms of sales and profits and so that\u2019s why the focus is as Greg mentioned earlier, on more disruptive innovation, continued strong value offers, all the things that we need to do to make our brand positions even stronger and in an environment that has over time become more competitive.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks. Jana next question please.","Operator","The next question is Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open.","Keith Siegner","So Pat, I\u2019m going to apologize, but I\u2019m going to follow-up a little bit on that. Look, margins in China have come in much better than you expected. You reiterated 20%, with the confidence in the 20% long term. We talk about this $600 million and that\u2019s not sure in this timing, but look when that timing would happen. But let me ask you in a different way; given the success and the productivity, initiatives and what you\u2019ve achieved on the margins, it would seem to me that you should be able to recover the 20% long before you recovery the PKUVs. Is there any reason why that wouldn\u2019t be the case.","Pat Grismer","No, I think that\u2019s a fair statement, because the underlying economics have gotten stronger. So as the sales come back, the flow-through will be at a much higher rate.","Keith Siegner","That\u2019s it from me thanks.","Steve Schmitt ","Thanks Keith. Next question please, Jana.","Operator","Yes, Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse","Hi, I\u2019m actually going to not ask a question about a China, but instead look at the Taco Bell business in the U.S., where your tier trends continue to accelerate. Just thinking through the moving pieces of that, could you help us understand how much of that might be coming from \u2013 you still continue growth in the breakfast day part versus value versus any other specific products innovation.","Greg Creed","I think the good news is the Taco Bell performance in the U.S. is holistic, which is it has great entry price point value. They\u2019ve had growth in breakfast from 6% to 7% mix, which I think takes it to like $90,000 and the West Cost the mix is now over 10%.","The innovation that was run in the quarter was compelling, disruptive and the assets are in great shape, the customer experience is improving. It\u2019s holistic, its all of the things and at the same time obviously they are starting to experiment with things like delivery and on the cutting edge of that, the mobile app. I think everywhere you turn, this brand is so relevant to its target audience and I think so clearly positioned with products that are driven out of real consumer insights. I think that\u2019s why they\u2019ve had a great first half and that\u2019s why we remain confident about how they are a great second in obviously 2016 and beyond.","Karen Holthouse","Great. Thank you.","Steve Schmitt","Thank you, Karen.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles","Thanks. Two questions from me. First, if the key to the China term will be innovation and breakfast only represents 7% of sales, it seems to be performing well already. Why not double down efforts on lunch and dinner in the back half of the year and continue innovating on these day parts to turn China faster?","Greg Creed","I think my answer would be having done this myself when I was running Taco Bell. You got to balance this out, which is you've got all these day parts that we are going to try and get growth from. And what we have seen in the past, even if we sort of over invest in certain areas, it\u2019s better to have a balance spend behind breakfast, lunch and dinner and then even if you\u2019ve got enough money, you know the day parts like late night and snaking, right. So I think that this is \u2013 we\u2019ve got great product, we are putting the right amount of resource behind it. We got the current promotion on the wing bucket which is off to a nice start and I think this balanced investment behind all the day parts is the right way for us to invest in the business.","Pat Grismer","Andrew, this is Pat, I would just build on Greg\u2019s comments by highlighting the important role that coffee will play in building multiple day parts. So while it\u2019s an important part of our breakfast day part, it also contributes to afternoon tea time and it contributes to late night and we are very excited with the results we are seeing from coffee and how its lifted sales as the 2,000 units that have already gotten the coffee, the premium coffee program that we will expanding that to more units by the end of year.","Andrew Charles","Got you. So far this year there has been a seasonally high amount of KFC China store closures. Are these stores \u2013 how would you categorize them? Are they primarily located in Tier 1, Tier 2. I mean, what\u2019s driving the decision to close these stores rather than refranchise them?","Pat Grismer","Well, this is Pat, Andrew. We make those closure decisions one unit at a time. It\u2019s not always a function of underperformance. There may be forced closures due to \u2013 we come upon the end of a lease and were unable to renew on favorable terms. So there could be a variety of things driving that, but we don\u2019t expect a substantial increase in KFC closures for the full year versus last year, and in fact we expect total closures to be slightly down versus last year, because last year\u2019s number was propped by substantial consolidation of the Little Sheep estate.","Greg Creed","Thanks Andrew.","Steve Schmitt","Next question please Jana.","Operator","Jeff Farmer has your next question with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff Farmer","Thank you and sorry Greg to keep hitting you in on China. But the last time KFC China saw a rapid same store sales recovery. Concept has a sizable mix in menu pricing tailwind where it looks like mix alone represented more than half of that 21% same store sales growth. The concept is still in the second quarter \u201914.","So with that, how should we be thinking about the role mix and menu pricing are expected to play in the China same store sales recovery in the coming quarters. And to that point, have you already begun to see the return of the higher average family visits that were a big benefit a year ago in the recovery process.","Pat Grismer","Jeff, this is Pat and I\u2019ll respond to your question and Greg may add some things. But from the same recovery standpoint, our focus is primarily on traffic, its rebuilding traffic. From a pricing perspective our policy is unchanged, which is that we generally look to pricing to work with productivity to offset inflation. We are very conscious of the important role that value plays in building traffic over time. So we wouldn\u2019t expect mix to be an outsized contributor to sales growth going forward. The emphasis will be more on traffic driven through a combination of value and innovation.","Greg Creed","I would just echo that, which is this is going to be a balance of disruptive innovation and value and I think the combination of those is exactly what we need to focus on.","Jeff Farmer","Just a quick follow-up, where does pricing stand right now, menu pricing, actually heading into the back half of \u201915.","Steve Schmitt","Jeff, this is Steve. Pricing is about 3% and that should be pretty consistent through the year and just another data point on your question. The quarter check was relatively flat. It was up about 2%, but it is primarily driven by transactions.","Jeff Farmer","All right, thank you.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Jeff, Jana, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. Your line is open.","R.J. Hottovy","Thanks. I actually had a question on India. Obviously, it's a small part of the business today, but one that you've spoken about in the past having a great long-term potential. You've now had three quarters of double-digit comp declines in the region. Just curious what's driving that, and if that's changing some of your thinking about long-term unit potential in the region. Thanks.","Greg Creed","I think we remain very bullish on India. In the long term there is no reason not to \u2013 there is massive population and urbanization of that population and there is obviously underlying economic growth.","I think that we did expect \u2013 I think with the Modi government change that there might be a sort of perceptible change in consumer perception and I guess that probably hasn\u2019t had, we haven\u2019t seen that. What I like is that, we have an incredibility strong team in India and I have to say they are probably the best team we have at building knowhow. The Indian team do not suffer from not invented here and they are really aggressively learning what we got and what is working as I said in countries like Australia, South Africa, the UK and Russia. And they are already concept testing and they recognize that value remains an issue; entry price point value remains an issue and obviously innovation, so the same things we keep talking about.","But what I want to give them credit for is really reaching out to the rest of YUM!, building knowhow, taking the advise back into India and with a real sense of urgency, actually putting them into the market place. So I\u2019m long term bullish. I love the team and I think they are doing all the right things in order to accelerate the sort of improved momentum in same store sales.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Jana, I think we have one more question.","Operator","Yes, your final question is Paul Westra with Stifel. Your line is open.","Paul Westra","Great. Thank you very much. Just for some clarity on China, maybe help here with the last question. When you say that the comp performance is a little bit below expectations, you mean below your original positive 3% to 7%, so your comments today saying comps could be in the low single digit positives. Second-half comps are still looking to be more positive than the first half that was negative. I just wanted to make sure that's clear.","Pat Grismer","That is correct.","Greg Creed","Absolutely correct, Paul.","Paul Westra","Great. And then when you mentioned your transaction trends on a DC line basis continue to sequentially improve, you are seeing sequential, again month-to-month traffic recovery versus\u2026","Pat Grismer","Paul I wouldn\u2019t say month-to-month, certainly quarter-to-quarter. We never said that the recovery was going to be linier and so there is natural choppiness from month-to-month, but as we step back and look at how traffic has rebuilt since the incident last summer, we are seeing a nice steady improvement in that curve.","Paul Westra","Okay. I guess then my last sort of new real question, I guess go back to the color on your China average check strategy, I guess maybe before the dual crises. My understanding and I know part of the renovation program was if anything designed to enhance KFC's sort of premium brand positioning maybe moved the check up of all things being equal, move people up the menu, we certainly can understand the focus on traffic here. Is that still a sort of latent opportunity intermediate-term or how does that play in I guess the new menu here?","Greg Creed","Paul, I think there\u2019s a couple of things; one, the amount of remodeling going on in China is accelerating. I enjoy what\u2019s coming and I think they are on the way for us to be much more focused on our remodeling of the assets. So the good news is we are sort of doubling the number of assets we are getting remodeled. So that is a great way of keeping our assets relative and then I think it\u2019s just back to the point we\u2019ve been making along, which is about balance. We actually have to balance the pay menu with what I call disruptive innovation and wow value and I think our ability to do that, as well as it will improve the assets and obviously deliver a superior customer experience. All of those combined will be what sort of makes us long term successful and as we keep saying yes, we will have a strong second half, we will go positive. We remain very confident in the long term of China.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks Paul and thank you all for joining us today and this concludes our call. Thank you.","Greg Creed","Thanks everybody.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22815":["Yum! Brands, Inc.

Finally, save the date for the Yum! Brands Investor and Analyst Day to be held on Wednesday, December 5, 2018. We will provide greater details as we get closer to the date.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. System sales growth for the second quarter was 4%, with 1% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. As we discussed on our earnings call last quarter, four items were expected to weigh on our second quarter core operating profit results. These included the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising, the revenue recognition accounting standard change, the KFC distributor disruption in the UK and the lap of some one-time benefits at KFC. As a result, and consistent with our expectations for the quarter, core operating profit declined 6%.","We are reiterating our 2018 full year guidance. However, given the strong unit development in the first half of the year, we expect net new unit growth to be at the high-end of our guidance of 3% to 4% and same-store sales growth, given the softer first half of the year, to be at the lower end of our guidance of 2% to 3%. It's also important to note that, excluding the KFC distributors' disruption in the UK, first half same-store sales growth would have been 2%, within the range of our full year guidance. As a reminder, our full year core operating profit guidance of approximately flat includes anticipated headwinds of 6 to 7 percentage points related to the timing mismatch between refranchising and the associated G&A savings, along with 2 to 3 percentage points related to revenue recognition accounting standard.","Looking at the second half of the year, we're confident in our plans and are performing on track with those plans thus far through the third quarter. We are now a year and a half into our transformation and are continuing to execute on the key items designed to deliver accelerated growth. The foundation of this is our four key growth drivers, which David and I will talk to you about today.","I'll provide an update on two of these drivers, our distinctive, relevant and easy brands and unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will discuss the next two, bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability, along with the details of our second quarter results. I'll start with our three distinctive, relevant and easy brands.","Beginning with KFC Global, system sales grew 6% with same-store sales growth of 2% and net new unit growth of 5%. We continued to see strength in Australia, Russia & Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, including Turkey and North Africa and our India markets. The success in these markets was primarily a result of balancing the core, value, innovation, and also ensuring the operational basics are executed well.","In particular, I want to highlight our KFC Australia market. Year-after-year, this market continues to deliver, posting 4% same-store sales growth year-to-date for a two-year stack of 11%, of which approximately 75% is transaction growth. They have wrapped the KFC brand within the lovable, larrikin Australian culture, distinguishing KFC and helping drive the consistently strong same-store sales growth. I'm proud of the fact that transactions have been driven by their focus on core products. We just celebrated 50 years in this market and I look forward to many more years of continued growth.","Just last week, the KFC team from across the globe held their Annual Marketing Planning Meeting with record breaking attendance. The event focused on sharing know-how and facilitating collaboration by connecting our teams with each other. Themes centered around building sales overnight and brand over time with the objective of making KFC more distinctive, relevant and easy. The market teams bring so much passion for the brand and I love this way of bringing best practices to life around the globe.","Shifting to the U.S., I'm proud that the innovation team has delivered with the Crispy Colonel Sandwich. Operational enhancements ensure the sandwich is delivered hot and fresh to each customer with options for a classic sandwich or one of the delicious flavor profiles of Nashville Hot, Georgia Gold or Smoky Mountain BBQ. As a bonus, we introduced a new pickle flavor, which could be added to any Extra Crispy product, including the Crispy Colonel Sandwich. This was a very limited-time offering, as each store was only shipped one case of the new cult favorite. Without any traditional commercials, Pickle Chicken spread by word of mouth and generated significant buzz for the brand.","Before moving onto Pizza Hut, I want to provide an update on the KFC UK business, which suffered a setback as a result of disruptions in supply, when we changed distribution partners in the first quarter. As expected, all stores were fully up and running by mid-May. We've turned the national advertising back on and are seeing good customer response. I'm very thankful to and proud of the team who have worked tirelessly since the disruption began. It is because of their hard work, collaborative spirit and dedication that customers in the UK are now able to enjoy the KFC they love and missed.","Now to Pizza Hut. In the U.S., system sales declined 1% with flat same-store sales and net new unit decline of 2%. During the second quarter, we launched an innovative product with our Double Cheesy Crust Pan Pizza that customers enjoy and mix well in our menu offerings. However, this campaign shifted marketing away from the value offering, which we believe weighed on same-store sales growth in the quarter. We know consistent value is of the utmost importance and at the core of our brands, and so we've adjusted our marketing for the balance of the year to remind customers we're a brand offering everyday compelling value.","Regarding our Transformation Agreement investments, we continued to gain traction with our commitment to Hot, Fast and Reliable experience. Our investments in digital, delivery, operations, and loyalty are generating improvements in internal metrics. In fact, our delivery times have improved by three minutes versus prior delivery times to the Transformation Agreement. Customer satisfaction scores have also significantly increased as was recently reported by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Pizza Hut customer satisfaction score increased 5%, the largest gain in the category making Pizza Hut tied for fourth amongst limited service restaurants.","Lastly, we recently announced a new partnership with advertising agency, GSD&M and could not be more excited about the creative opportunities that await this powerful brand and look forward to an exciting activation of our football partnerships including our new NFL agreement and the extension of our NCAA agreement. We still believe that Pizza Hut U.S. turnaround will be a slow build, but we're encouraged by the foundation that's being put in place and continue to make significant strides to improve the brand's position.","Internationally, system sales grew 1% with same-store sales decline of 2% and net new unit growth of 6%. The strong net new unit growth represents an acceleration over last year, as our Delcos continue to generate healthy unit level economics, keeping franchisees excited and motivated to continue building the footprint of our brand.","Additionally, we were very excited to announce our landmark international growth alliance with Telepizza back in May. This alliance will double Pizza Hut's footprint in the regions covered, place Pizza Hut in the number one position in the category across Latin America and the Caribbean in terms of unit count and confirm Pizza Hut's position as the world's largest pizza restaurant company. Please note completion of the alliance is subject to certain conditions including regulatory approvals. Upon approval and deal closure, Telepizza units will be included in our unit count.","Outside of unit development, we have significant work to do around same-store sales growth. Many markets are experiencing similar issues to those faced in the U.S. and we are taking the learnings from the U.S. market and applying them internationally.","In particular, I want to elaborate on the three key steps I outlined last quarter, which are designed to reignite same-store sales growth. First is ensuring we have strong operations and digital execution in place to deliver on being the easiest, fastest, tastiest pizza. Secondly, is making sure we have compelling value in each of our markets with examples such as the 69 pesos Pan Pizza in Mexico, \u00a35 Favorites value in the UK and medium two-topping online deal in Canada. Third, is a consistent communication about For The Love of Pizza brand positioning. Overall, we are utilizing the repeatable model to roll out these three key initiatives across each of our international markets and we'll continue to update you as we progress.","Now to Taco Bell, where system sales grew 5% with same-store sales growth of 2% and net new unit growth of 3%. The quarter began with our $1 Nacho Fries followed by the $1 Triple Melt Burrito and Nachos. Also available in the $5 Box, the Triple Melt Burrito and Nachos featured a delicious blend of melted cheddar, mozzarella and pepper jack cheeses. We also brought back the Naked Chicken Chalupa, an innovative take on the taco shell made of fried chicken now in both a wild and mild flavor.","And as we move into the third quarter, Nacho Fries are back for a sequel. The PR buzz around the follow-up faux movie trailer Web of Fries II: Franchise Wars. The record breaking launch in the first quarter had customers asking for more and we're happy to bring them back. Taco Bell's ability to innovate and elevate around both their marketing and products highlights the fact the brand proudly stands in a Category of One. Internationally, this is only the beginning for Taco Bell and I'm excited to see the brand grow and expand. I'd like to highlight two examples of this exciting international growth.","First being our Canadian business which continued to build on its four consecutive years of at least high single digit same-store sales growth with 11% same-store sales growth year-to-date. This was supported by the introduction of the Bacon Ranch Naked Chicken Chalupa, making use of the repeatable model from the U.S. India has leveraged weekday value as well as innovation to deliver 14% same-store sales growth year-to-date. As an example of their innovation, they introduced the Crispy Potaco, a taco with a shell made from hash browns. Finally, we're building momentum with delivery, which is now available in over 40% of our international stores. I'm proud of the work Taco Bell International is doing to lay the groundwork for exponential growth and will continue to update on their progress.","Now, moving onto Unrivaled Culture and Talent, the executive leadership team and I just completed a trip to Africa, an exciting and growing market for Pizza Hut and one of our larger and most dominant KFC markets. The trip reminded me just how contagious our culture is and how it can be leveraged to fuel results. Pizza Hut entered sub-Saharan Africa just four years ago and now has nearly 100 restaurants across 12 countries, a remarkable rate of growth, and with the goal of being in 25 countries with 250 restaurants by 2020.","Through the second quarter of this year alone, we've already entered two new markets: Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. The team has leveraged the experience of the KFC Africa team growing at a very fast clip and flipping to cash flow positive this year. The team is building the cultural foundation necessary for explosive growth and we believe there's an opportunity for thousands of additional units in Africa. I also want to highlight the huge heart our KFC Africa team has. As part of our trip, we visited the Giyani Preschool (14:55) where our Add Hope program provides nutritious meals for preschoolers.","I was proud to learn that only the South African Government provides more meals to children in South Africa than a KFC does. I'm energized by the enthusiasm and passion both teams have for each of our brands. Their culture is reflective of the country's culture and values and I'm confident it will continue to drive fast paced growth at Pizza Hut and long term sustainable results at KFC. Thanks to the team for hosting us and I look forward to celebrating your continued growth.","Finally, we take our role as a global citizen and our impact on society and the environment seriously. We've recently released our 2017 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report called our Recipe for Good that outlines our public commitments over the last two years concerning food, planet and people. I'm proud of how our brands are simplifying ingredients, providing more balanced options, making strides in our sustaining sourcing and usage practices in our restaurants, giving back in our communities and unlocking potential for all types of people as I've already discussed. Our Recipe for Good will unite our employees, franchisees and suppliers on the priorities that matter and will keep us focused on socially responsible growth, managing risks and serving more goodness to our customers, shareholders, communities and the planet.","In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we're doing around the world, focusing on our four key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum! We remain confident in our full year 2018 guidance as we lay the foundation to our transformation strategy designed to maximize shareholder value.","And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives, and two of our four growth capabilities: Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability.","Let's start with our second quarter results. We continued to execute against our transformation strategy, while as we explained in our first quarter earnings call, the following four items weighed on our second quarter core operating profit results: the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising; the revenue recognition accounting standard change; the KFC distributor disruption in the UK; and the lap of some one-time benefits at KFC.","As a result, and consistent with our expectations for the quarter, core operating profit declined 6%. We are reiterating our full year 2018 guidance and remain committed to delivering at least $3.75 in EPS in 2019. As a reminder, our full year 2018 guidance of approximately flat core operating profit growth incorporates headwinds of 6 percentage points to 7 percentage points related to the timing mismatch between refranchising and the associated G&A savings, and 2 to 3 percentage points related to the revenue recognition accounting standard.","Given the strong unit development in the first half of the year, we expect net new unit growth to be at the high-end of our guidance of 3% to 4% and same-store sales growth, given the softer first half of the year, to be at the low end of our guidance of 2% to 3%. We are confident in our plans for the second half of the year and are seeing good progress against these plans thus far in the third quarter.","Before moving onto our transformation initiatives, I'll discuss the impact of the distribution disruptions in our KFC UK business. We estimate second quarter same-store sales growth of 1% at Yum! and 2% at KFC would have been 2% at Yum! and 3% at KFC after adjusting for the impact. We continue to expect the impact on full year same-store sales growth to be 25 basis points for Yum! and 50 basis points for KFC.","Regarding core operating profit growth, we estimate declines of 6% at both Yum! and KFC would have been declines of 5% at Yum! and 3% at KFC after adjusting for the impact. We continue to expect the impact on full year core operating profit growth to be a 2% impact on KFC and 1% impact on Yum!","All of our stores in the UK opened for business offering their full menus beginning mid-May with advertising beginning at the end of May. Please keep in mind that the KFC UK business reports on a period basis, with their second quarter ending on June 11. Consequently, the second quarter saw limited benefit as a result of the return to advertising at the end of May. We do not expect this issue to have further impact on our results going forward.","Now turning to our transformation initiatives, to be more focused, more franchised, and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, being more focused allows us to devote our attention to our four key growth drivers in order to elevate system sales growth to our bold goal of 7%. We're confident the focus on these four items is the catalyst for sustainably growing our system sales over the long-term.","Second, we continue to make progress towards becoming more franchised, selling 51 restaurants this quarter. We are 97% franchised and are on track to be 98% franchised by year end. Third, we are becoming a more efficient company by reducing our CapEx and G&A spend. We are on track with 2018 CapEx guidance of $200 million to $250 million and 2019 run rate CapEx of $100 million. In addition, we expect to deliver on our G&A savings resulting in G&A representing 1.7% of system sales in 2019. Each of these initiatives are designed to maximize growth for our shareholders.","We are maintaining our 2019 EPS target of at least $3.75. We also remain committed to returning between $6.5 billion and $7 billion to our shareholders between 2017 and 2019. During the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 8 million shares for a total of $643 million and paid $116 million in dividends. Since the beginning of 2017, we have returned over $3.7 billion to our shareholders.","Now, let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with bold restaurant development. As Greg mentioned, we recently announced an alliance with Telepizza, which involves Telepizza opening at least 1,300 new stores over the next 10 years and at least 2,550 stores total over 20 years. While this deal is expected to be EBITDA neutral in the short-term, we believe this strategic alliance will be accretive over the long-term. It will provide us with a foothold in key European markets, something which would have taken decades to achieve on our own as well as consolidate a majority of our Latin American markets under one master franchisee.","In addition to immediately expanding our restaurant base, this agreement should accelerate our unit growth and allow us to leverage Telepizza's incredible depth and capability in delivery operations and supply chain management. Please note completion of the alliance is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. Upon approval and deal closure, Telepizza's units covered by this agreement will be included in our unit count. We are excited about the potential the alliance with Telepizza brings to the Pizza Hut brand.","Importantly, net new unit development remains a strength of Pizza Hut International, with 6% net new unit growth over prior year. In contrast to the current asset base, which has a heavy reliance on dine-in, we expect at least 90% of our net new unit openings this year to be the Delco Model, which generally bodes healthy paybacks and strong unit level economics. With the focus on the three key areas Greg mentioned, operations, value, and communication, and a shift in our asset base, I am confident Pizza Hut is laying the foundation for long-term success.","At Taco Bell, we opened another nine international units this quarter, including a new market entry in Peru. We also continue to see growth in our domestic urban walk-in and Cantina restaurants, opening three new units in New York, part of the 34 gross new U.S. units Taco Bell opened this quarter.","As for KFC, they again proved they are a global powerhouse, opening nearly 200 net new units this quarter. Through the first half of 2018, KFC has opened over 100 additional net new units than the first half of 2017. There remains significant whitespace for the brand and we are excited to grow our presence across the globe. In aggregate, accelerating unit growth across our three brands is a driving factor supporting our long term bold goal of 7% system sales. We remain committed to this goal and are confident there is significant potential to have continued global unit growth for each of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell.","Now onto our fourth growth driver, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. First, as Greg mentioned, the American Customer Satisfaction Index report noted Pizza Hut U.S. as having the highest percentage increase in customer satisfaction scores amongst all restaurant companies. This is firsthand evidence the customer is noticing our investment in and commitment to a Hot, Fast and Reliable experience at Pizza Hut U.S.","Second, at Taco Bell, to continue our momentum and focus on speed, we launched a unique after-dark program, aimed at driving performance improvement after dark our fastest growing day-part. As a result of the launch, Taco Bell has seen a 1 percentage point improvement in customer satisfaction both before 5:00 P.M. and after 5:00 P.M. and an improvement in overall system speed performance after 5:00 P.M. by two seconds. Some franchise organizations have improved their speed by as much as 30 seconds resulting in over 1% increase in transaction growth.","Third, both KFC and Pizza Hut held their international franchise conventions this quarter and both events had a strong emphasis on building long-term operating capability.","For KFC, with over 1000 attendees from across the globe, the convention reinforced the Always Original brand positioning to bring clarity and consistency around building a relevant and distinctive brand. But the convention also had a big focus on building an easy brand specifically targeting delivery, digital technology, and leveraging data.","The franchisees share a passion for the brand and we're working together to ensure our efforts around easy apply not only to our customers but also to our team members and restaurant operators. We will keep you updated as we continue to innovate around our digital platform.","At Pizza Hut International franchise convention, the focus was around the unfinished agenda on same-store sales growth. We shared the recipe for growth with our franchisees, which Greg outlined for you today, including strong operations and digital execution, value and consistent communication, along with showcasing our fast casual Delco.","Finally, we were excited to announce a few new master franchise agreements last quarter. Sforza Holding is now our master franchisee for all three of our brands in Brazil. Sforza has proven they're one of our 3C franchisees, already bringing capital, capability, and commitment to the Taco Bell brand by being the first franchisee who has had a Taco Bell development record with the opening of 15 new restaurants in the first year.","The master franchise agreement for each brand includes significant development agreements and we are excited to see our brands grow in Brazil under Sforza's control. Sforza is one of the first two master franchise agreements for Taco Bell. Taco Bell has also signed a master franchise agreement with Casual Brands Group in Spain. Casual Brands Group currently owns and operates 40 Taco Bell restaurants throughout Spain and won the prestigious Taco Bell International Franchisee of the Year award.","Collectively, Sforza and Casual Brands Group are committed to opening more than 400 Taco Bell restaurants over the next decade.","In Russia, Pizza Hut has partnered with AmRest as their master franchisee to accelerate growth. AmRest has proven to be a valued partner with both our KFC and Pizza Hut brands already. And we look forward to the opportunities they will bring to Pizza Hut Russia.","Each of the franchisees mentioned signing our master franchise agreements are valuable partners who represent our 3C requirement of being capitalized, capable and committed.","After attending the KFC and Pizza Hut International franchise conventions I'm reminded just how strong our franchise base is at all three of our brands. As a highly franchised company, the relationships and alignment we have with our franchisees is paramount. Through these partnerships we are confident we will continue delivering a world with more Yum!","To wrap-up, our second quarter core operating profit results were as we expected. We remain confident in delivering on our transformation initiatives. And while there may be noise between quarters, we are pleased with the progress to-date.","Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. My one question is going to be on the unit growth, I know you just came into that (29:21) 4% rate now. And if you sustain this 4% unit growth, is the composition of the growth that we're seeing across the brand now how you would expect it to continue with KFC now growing above 4%, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell both performing kind of slightly below 4%? And if you were to somehow accelerate growth from here from this 4%, what of the three brands would drive that in your view? Thanks.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Hi. Yeah, great question Brian. I am really excited about what's going on in development. Just to put some numbers around it. Year-to-date we've opened 482 net new units versus 317 at this point last year. So we're up 165 units.","As for the composition and what that might look like going forward, obviously, KFC and the level that they are performing on and the growth number of units that they're opening is fairly significant. But they still have enormous runway to keep going and take their numbers up. But Taco Bell and Pizza Hut starting from lower numbers I think can have even more room to improve their percentages in their growth rates.","The Pizza Hut model with the Delcos, as we said, we're getting 90% of our growth through Delcos. It's a really efficient way to build new units with great returns for franchisees in most cases. So we see ramping that up fairly significantly and you're seeing that right now around the world.","And then Taco Bell as we've said many, many times is really just scratching the surface internationally. So my guess is as we go forward you'll see the composition change a little bit with Pizza Hut and Taco Bell becoming a bigger and bigger part of unit growth and KFC taking their already very impressive numbers up further as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on that move towards 4% unit growth. A question on delivery. With your investment in Grubhub, you're in a great position to see what's going on in U.S. delivery these days, obviously you have a big play there in Pizza and it looks like the big three pizza players in aggregate are weaker than they were in the past. Do you attribute this to non-pizza delivery hurting Pizza? And could you talk about your lift today, how delivery is going with KFC and Taco Bell and what you think that might be as you look ahead with Grubhub? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think we're in obviously the early days of testing with Grubhub. I think that's \u2013 I think the key thing is that we've got the systems integrated. So we're in the very early days. We are seeing what you'd expect us to see, which is incremental transactions we're seeing higher check. We've not unleashed the marketing muscle behind it, so we think there's a lot more transaction growth to get. But the transactions appear to be incremental at a much higher check. So I think in that sense we feel good about delivery. And obviously, I think that we'll obviously work with Grubhub in order to grow this opportunity. Nothing better than a new occasion and a higher check that's all good for us and we'll obviously continue to support that and make that a big deal going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. On the Pizza Hut business globally and you talked about some operational tweaks you need to make, some marketing. But there's also a fair proportion of stores that currently don't offer delivery. So is there some sort of unlock that you can achieve early on in terms of getting some of those dine in stores to deliver? Is that a key piece to driving incremental same-store sales? And I did want you maybe just to address the prior question about delivery maybe impacting particularly some of your global Pizza Hut markets (33:19) in some markets that deliver x pizza or aside from pizzas impacting the delivery business in certain markets?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I mean on the question of the dine-in stores at Pizza Hut and their ability to deliver, we actually do have some dine-in stores that deliver out of the dine-in stores, we call them restaurant-based delivery. And with aggregators it does make it easier to add dine-in stores to the delivery world and have the aggregators deliver from our dine-in stores.","I think Yum! China has taken advantage of that opportunity. So for us, the dine-in asset base though is very different around the world for Pizza Hut. In some cases, it's nearly white tablecloth. In other cases, it might resemble more of a fast casual kind of asset and you have to take into account on the delivery side is the back of the restaurant actually set up to deliver? In some cases it is, in some cases it isn't. In some cases, the menu is something that could be delivered, in other cases it's more of a dine-in menu. So we are \u2013 where there are opportunities we are taking advantage of the ability to add delivery to our dine-in assets. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, the vast majority of the stores we're building, the Telepizza stores that we are adding, they are all delivery capable stores. So you'll see our asset base become more and more delivery capable over time. As far as the trends on delivery...","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think if you look at our international pizza business, there's a distinct difference between our performance in dine-in and our performance in off-premise. And so we feel good about our off-premise performance in our international Pizza Hut business. It's got some very good numbers and, as I said, there's quite a difference between that and our dine-in. We've still got some strong dine-in markets, Hong Kong, Indonesia that are performing well. But, clearly, as David said, we're building the future which is Delcos and we're still seeing good growth in international in our off-premise business.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, both U.S. and internationally, our delivery business is in growth mode. Our delivery carryout business is in growth mode. So back to the earlier question of, are we seeing other people getting into delivery impacting us, it would be hard for us to say that since we feel pretty good about our Pizza Hut delivery carryout business today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Hi. I was hoping to get an update on delivery specifically at KFC and Taco Bell in the U.S., how many units have been fully integrated into the GRUB platform from a delivery perspective on the front-end, but how much of that work is already been done on the backend as well, (36:02) a possibility to talk about your comps in the U.S. specifically, which might be the future indicator of Taco Bell and KFC stores that have received delivery, how much of an incremental boost to the business that's been?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, look, I think as we've said a couple of times, we're pleased with the initial results that we're seeing by adding delivery into Taco Bell and KFC. Remember, Taco Bell already had a decent sized pool of stores that they experimented with delivery with another aggregator partner. Behind the scenes, we're doing all the work to integrate the systems with Grubhub, so that we can make this the fastest most seamless process for consumers and for our store employees. And we feel good about how that work is going.","We're not throwing out numbers and targets and when certain number of units are going to be opened because there are several milestones we have to get through as we go on this journey. In fact, we're still trying to finalize the specific terms of the agreements that our franchisees will sign with GRUB. And then until things like that happen, we don't have complete visibility to a timeline around certain units and when they'll all be on. But as far as initial results, I think we're pleased with how things have gone.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, another question on the delivery front, where you have been testing delivery, do you have any early data you can share in terms of delivery times that you're accomplishing or achieving?","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yes. I mean, look, I think the key is as we've been trying to say, this is very early. We're in test. We haven't unleashed the marketing muscle of each of the brands in order to drive it. So I think we're seeing times that we're really happy with. So we've obviously got a very big Pizza Hut delivery business. We know what the expectations of the customers are. So I think we feel good about the delivery times that we're delivering to the customers.","The transactions per restaurant are still small, but I believe that with all the work we've got from our Pizza Hut knowledge on how to deliver, that we are meeting the customer's expectations. So I feel good about that. The tests are very early, small number of stores. And I think as David said correctly, getting both KFC and Taco Bell integrated in the POS system, we don't want to be going to a tablet to order, to place an order because then you get speed issues. You get accuracy issues. We know all of that. So we would rather get the integration done right, test the integration, then unleash the marketing dollars and then drive the incrementality that we know we'll get.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","And in a good way I guess, we're fairly sophisticated when it comes to the subject of delivery. We know delivery well from our Pizza Hut business. So getting Taco Bell and KFC in, we have very high standards for where we want to ultimately get to. And while, as Greg said, we're pleased with where we're at right now in the journey, we know what ultimately the kinds of times and accuracy that you need to deliver in delivery. We're not there yet, but we're on that path to getting there with GRUB right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. My question is on the interplay of comp and unit growth. If over the long run, your units gravitate more towards that 4% unit growth range, why wouldn't your comp naturally gravitate more towards that 2% over the long run? Given you have 45,000 units around the world and growing at that higher rate just adds that many more units, you're going to have more cannibalization. It probably is a distraction to execution. I'm just kind of curious why the long run wouldn't look like your guidance for this year.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Look, I think that being at the low end of 2% to 3% is not where I want us to be. I think we have every capability to be closer to the high end of the range. And it's probably not a surprise to anybody that based on our first half performance even accounting for the KFC performance in the UK, we have strengthened the back half calendars on all the brands.","We happen to have a thing called, as David said, the marketing planning meeting last week for KFC. I sat through every one of those brand presentations. I've seen the calendar adjustments. I think that there is still opportunity for us to grow closer to the 3% than the 2% we are delivering. And I can assure you we're very focused on, obviously, continuing to grow the net new units that David spoke about, and which we're obviously happy about. But I do believe we can still accelerate our growth closer to 3% than to 2%.","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Yeah, on the specific question, it was a fair question though, as we expand will we end up with more and more cannibalization impacting same store sales growth? Actually if you think about where we're growing, mostly very much wide open spaces. We talked in our opening comments about how Pizza Hut's just entering Sub-Saharan Africa, there is new countries to enter, there's hundreds of units to build. I mean in many ways the units that you build start to produce more marketing dollars, which help you grow your topline more. Certainly at some point you'll get to saturation and you will deal with more of the impact issues that are little bit more common in the U.S.","We have a very big presence in emerging markets where the markets are growing, where our unit counts are growing along with the population and with the purchasing power of the population and we really don't see a lot of concern about cannibalization from the development folks and where we're building stores.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen.","Andrew Charles - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Thanks. Dave you called out core operating profit growth in 2Q is expected to be the softest for the year, but you showed pretty good traction on G&A savings which at 1.8% of system sales in the quarter is brushing up against that 1.7% target as well as franchise and property expenses. Does the full year guidance for flat core operating profit embed accelerated levels of savings in these two line items as we look out to the back half of the year?","David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.","I wouldn't necessarily say accelerated, obviously, as we're getting towards the end of the refranchising and most of the \u2013 we have two kinds of G&A cuts, obviously, the organic cuts that were independent of refranchising and those related to our refranchising. The vast majority of the organic cuts were made early in this journey and then we're coming to the end of the G&A reduction coming from the refranchising.","We do have some annualization of G&A savings, but you're absolutely right to point out, look, we're almost at the 1.7% target. You look at the first half number and sort of double that. You get a sense for where we can get to, where we want to go, we want to get to fairly comfortably as we keep growing the top line. So, yeah, we're in good shape on G&A and that's why we reiterated all the elements of the transformation in our commitment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. My question is on Pizza Hut, I guess, specifically on the U.S., just seems like the comps maybe aren't yet seeing the acceleration you had anticipated. So I'm wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit about the challenges, I think you mentioned most recently the move away from value, may be with a more of a noticeable headwind or maybe you can share any metrics related to the loyalty program and membership, and how your $130 million contribution would \u2013 where it would see the greatest benefit? Just trying to see if there any laterals to the \u2013 maybe the relative weakness we're seeing in China or whether it's just more U.S. specific? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Sure. I think there's no doubt that all three brands have to be on value, that's like given. And obviously getting back on value is critically important. I think the exciting opportunity for Pizza Hut in U.S. is to activate our NFL partnership. And obviously as we said, we renewed our NCAA partnership, and the way we look at it will be sort of owning football Thursday through Mondays. And I think there's nothing that brings America together more than football and pizza.","So I think all \u2013 as we said, all the internal metrics which we talked about are improving; three minute speed if a speed improvement, obviously customer satisfaction improving. And I'm looking forward to us activating this partnership as football season gets underway. And obviously, hopefully using that to drive our brand to be more relevant, to be more distinct and then obviously the functional foundational stuff is helping us make this more easy. So, I think we're doing all the right things. We've got to deliver the results, it's sort of show-me time, but we feel good about what we've got for the back half of the year on Pizza Hut in the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS.","Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the competitive environment you're seeing in the U.S. And I guess through that value lens specifically, and sort of what impact that it's having on the brands? Just following up on your commentary Greg, just Pizza Hut and the pivot towards value in the back half, just curious how easy it is to differentiate within the category on value, and if the combination of all the enhancements you're making to the brand right now can sort of enhance those benefits from pizza value.","And then just on Taco Bell, just a bit more about how all the innovative and differentiated value items that you had in the quarter, how they performed relative to your expectations and how you see the back half shaping up given the calendar if this value cycle continues? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Sure. Well, yeah, you're right. I mean value has become an important part of the industry. It's become an important part of every brand's positioning. As we talked about last week at the MPMs, I think there's also two ways to how you can communicate value: one is to apologize and one is to celebrate. I believe that we should be celebrating the fact that we can offer great value to our customers.","Each of the three brands has a very clear value roadmap. I'll use U.S. dollars to talk because it will be easier, but if you are thinking about KFC, they have got $5, $10, $20. And then some of the markets where we're seeing really good performance they've got disruptive value as well. Taco Bell has got $1, $5 boxes. To your point, they're all performing very well in line with our expectations. To given an example, the fries, nacho fries which we launched essentially a la carte in the third quarter, we've been able to put them in the $5 box. I think that will enhance the appeal of the $5 box by putting one of the most popular new products we've launched. And then on Pizza Hut, it's about consistently staying on every day value and making sure that we deliver great tasting pizzas at a great price.","So I think every day value will be important and I think the occasional hit of disruptive value will be important, because we've seen that where we deliver consistent every day value, it doesn't matter what the brand or what the country with the occasional disruptive value, that's the places we are winning and delivering the best same store sales growth.","Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. Just a quick I guess two parter: one, not to belabor this, but on the value piece are you getting any pushback from franchisees just because that's been such a characteristic of the market for so long, I'm surprised that you would have pulled back on that kind of marketing last quarter, so I wasn't sure if it was driven by franchisees?","And then I guess if you could just quickly comment. You mentioned disruption in the UK really to KFC but I guess you didn't allude to China. Had you expected some deceleration there because of the fact that you were able to get to the comp even with that I think was impressive, but I'm just trying to understand going forward with such a big market are you confident in the ability to offset with strength elsewhere? Thanks.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Sure. Well, I think franchise economics are critical right? I like to say if you have great economics for the franchisee and great enthusiasm from the customer you've got a winning combination. So we're obviously very conscious of franchise economics. I think a good example would be Taco Bell took a la carte fries from $1 to $1.29 but they put them in the $5 box and we're going to sell a lot more $5 boxes. And so I think each of the brands has done a very good job of being conscious of the unit level economic impact.","The other great thing is these businesses run off in a momentum and volume, and our ability with these disruptive value offers which are essentially protein only offers, example, in Australia which as I said earlier two year stack of 11, of which 7 or 8 is transaction growth. They run nine pizzas for $9.95 on a Tuesday because of the \u2013 and it's only chicken. So obviously all the sides are bought at full margin. So there's a lot of smart thinking that's gone into all of this. And obviously we've got our franchisees on board. We've got them supporting this, but we're very conscious of their economics. And I think you also saw in the quarter results that our Taco Bell margins improved despite the fact that we obviously were doubling down on $1 and $5 offering. So I think we've got a very good way of working with our franchise partners delivering great unit level economics for them and great customer enthusiasm.","On your question on China, I think the way I want to think about it is that, obviously they talked last night, we listened to their call about their new unit growth which we're excited about, them continuing to grow new units and the returns that they're getting on those units, so I think it's two units on KFC and three to four on Pizza Hut, so that's exciting. And the other great thing is the KFC China team and the Pizza Hut team were at the MPMs last week.","So they sat in for a whole week as every country shared what they're doing to drive same store sales growth. So the China team got to see what the Australia team is doing, and all those sort of things, and I think that's the beauty of a global business like Yum! which is we can share, we can cross collaborate. So I'm excited that they'll be able to take those learnings, go back, adjust their calendars just like we have adjusted the calendars in the rest of the business. And obviously hopefully deliver stronger same store sales growth in the back half of the year.","Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.","Okay, so let me just say, first of all, I want to thank everyone for taking their time to be on our call today. Like any business there are things that you're proud of and happy about, but there's always this unfinished business as we all know. I'm really proud of the entire organization's efforts and results on our transformation to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient. These were really bold goals and it's clear that we're going to achieve them. I'm also particularly proud of how we've step changed our new unit development, which we talked about today across the globe and across the three brands, and we've moved from consistently delivering 3% to now 4% net new unit growth. And I think David and I believe we have the opportunity to eventually even do better than that.","So where do we have unfinished business? Same store sales growth obviously. If I take out the impact of the KFC distributor issue, our numbers aren't bad, but I have to be honest to say I'm not content. And I know we can and will do a lot better. The brands have all adjusted their back half calendars which I've seen and I know now we have to deliver, not just talk about it. That's my focus. It's our focus for the second half.","So thanks again and I look forward to updating you on our journey to deliver a world with more Yum! Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22951":["YUM! Brands, Inc.

Second quarter 2019 earnings will be released on August 1, 2019, with the conference call on the same day.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Greg Creed.","Greg Creed","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone.","This quarter marks the start of the third and final year in our transformation of the Yum! Brands. We're pleased to report a strong start to the year, with first quarter system sales growth of 8% including 4% system sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our four growth drivers increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continue to fuel these results.","As usual, David and I will walk you through the lens of these four key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our relevant, easy, and distinctive brands or as we say RED for short as well as unrivaled culture and talent. Then, David, will discuss bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability.","I'll begin with our three RED brands. In the first quarter, KFC division delivered system sales growth of 9%, with same-store sales growth of 5%, and net new unit growth of 6%. This global powerhouse saw widespread strength coupled with standout performances in some of our larger markets, as well as a tailwind from lapping the distribution disruption in the UK last year.","Internationally call-outs for the quarter include Japan, Indonesia, Australia, Africa, and China. And you'll notice as I give some details, there are consistent themes value and innovation working well together. Japan and Indonesia led the way each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan's 15% same-store sales growth was driven by the well-received share pack as well as lunch value deals and Hot and Honey Chicken on-the-bone innovation. Indonesia\u2019s 12% same-store sales growth was driven by value and innovation with Big Box value counterbalanced by the Combo Superstar Innovation. Australia' same-store sales grew 6% on the back of the dual layer value combined with core product news. And Africa where 10% same-store sales growth came as a result of strong value promotions such as the streetwise mix coupled with an innovative Zinger chutney sandwich. Importantly these markets maintain momentum in development while generating this strong same-store sales growth.","Now the KFC U.S. where same-store sales grew 2%. We started the year off with a continued focus on value by introducing a new Channel for Ala Carte menu items offering our original Famous Bowls for just $3 and two chicken littles for $3. Both offers drove transactions for the quarter and allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. We then followed this up with new options in both the $5 fill-up and $20 family meal offerings.","Operational enhancements such as a new menu board design and delivery through Grubhub each positively contributed to first quarter sales. ","We now have 2,200 KFCs offering delivery and 3,200 restaurants available for click-and-collect on the Grubhub marketplace. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth for our franchisees and we look forward to the nationwide launch of KFC delivery in the U.S. later this year.","Lastly, KFC continued its campaign of distinctive and truly breakthrough marketing from the KFC innovations lab.","Moving onto our Pizza Hut division. In the U.S. same-store sales were flat and system sales declined 1% due to a net new unit decline of 1% as we continue to transform our asset base from dining to off-premise focused assets.","Pizza Hut U.S. continued to provide compelling value to customers by maintaining our $7.99 large two topping Pizza deal and the $5 line-up. The $5 line-up which features favorites like a medium one topping pizza, garlic knots, wings, and cinnabon mini-rolls helped drive traffic and provides a pipeline for future product innovation.","In March, we added a new teammate to the line-up with our pepperoni pizza ensuring our best innovation is accessible at a great price. As we've continued to reiterate for both the U.S. and the international businesses, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive.","We're encouraged by the steps we've taken to enhance assets, provide value offerings, and improve operations to help our franchisees succeed.","With that in mind, we're excited about our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage the Grubhub marketplace as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut.","We ended the first quarter with over 200 locations on the Grubhub marketplace. While customers are placing the orders on the Grubhub website, Pizza Hut delivery drivers are completing the orders.","Now onto Pizza Hut International. System sales grew 13% in the quarter including a benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales were flat. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like Malaysia, Indonesia, and Hong Kong. As one example, Malaysia delivered a very strong same-store sales growth at 6% with their dominant value offering I buy one get one promotion.","In regards to development, we continue to find success in our off-premise focused asset options including Delcos, fast casual Delcos, and express units. As we mentioned during our previous earnings call and at our Investor Day last year, the gap between dining channel sales and off-premise is significant with the U.S. and international seeing roughly seven points and six point differentials between the two channels respectively. In order to enhance the assets we view as the future of the brand, we're leveraging best practices from our strongest markets to provide targeted compelling options in our off-premise focused asset options.","Last, but not least, Taco Bell where system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 3%. Encouragingly the U.S. same-store sales grew a healthy 5%, they talked about international caused the division to round down to 4%.","Starting with the U.S., we began the quarter by showcasing $1 and $5 value and finished the quarter with innovation. Taco Bell continued to double down on value in the U.S. with the $1 Grundy burrito and the Double Cheesy Gordita Crunch Box. Our famous Nacho Fries came back for again for a limited time and was so popular that yet again one in four orders contained fries.","We then finished the quarter off strong by introducing a new limited time offering steak rattlesnake fries, our signature season fries with marinated steak keep that with a bit of creamy jalape\u00f1o sauce. Of course not surprised the Qu\u00e9date [ph] but they're also awesomely spicy. The official launch of Taco Bell's delivery has been very encouraging. Having launched with marketing support in February franchisees are all in on this major initiative and are very excited about delivery as an opportunity to drive incremental sales and transactions.","Given its early days, we aren't going to provide specific data, but I will say that both traffic and check saw benefits from the launch. Customers are also loving a new way to get their favorite Taco Bell products. Feedback has been positive plus the strength of our partnership with Grubhub has allowed for real time feedback and learnings to continue to elevate the customer experience to even higher levels. Delivery is now live in over 4,000 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time.","Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available on all tacobell.com and Taco Bell App while we're also expecting this functionality through Grubhub. The Taco Bell International there's a lot to be excited about. We expanded into the first new market of 2019 with the launch of Taco Bell Thailand where we hosted a launch party that generated nearly a half a billion impressions. Borrowing from the U.S., we introduced value boxes around the world which drove growth in the UK, India, and Japan. The UK opened its fifth restaurant in Central London and the \u00a35 Taco Box was a success. India maintained momentum with positive same-store sales driven by their launch of their Big Bell Box. And Taco Bell's dedication to their purpose to feed people's lives with Moss is shining through and we are proud of the team and our franchise partners who work hard to bring this iconic brand to life.","Now to unrivaled culture and talent. As you've heard me say before, our two most important assets are our brands and our people. For us unrivaled culture and talent is a true competitive advantage and we'll continue to focus on fuel results and accelerate growth. In the 140 markets where we operate, it's our 2,000 franchisees and their employees who are delivering the customer experience at KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. In fact, recently in Europe, David and I launched our next-generation leadership development course for franchisees and employees called Inspiring Culture to fuel results. This is a program focused on building up our people to lead in a way that makes our three iconic brands relevant, easy, and distinctive from the inside out. Because of the investment we continue to make in unrivaled culture and talent, we're seeing the strong progress and results on the transformation and setting a healthy foundation for sustainable growth.","In conclusion, I'm excited about the work we're doing with world class leaders focusing on our four key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum!","We remain confident as we relay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value.","And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs.","David Gibbs","Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone.","Today I'll discuss our first quarter results, a remaining transformation initiative and two of our four growth drivers bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability.","To begin, our first quarter results. Consistent with our expectations, core operating profit growth increased 12%. And as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 4%, and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution with 5% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth driving 9% system sales growth in the quarter.","It's great to see KFC offer such a strong start under new CEO, Tony Lowings. They're leaning in on same-store sales growth on top of what is already a development machine. Contribution to the KFC strength this quarter were broad-based. Japan, Indonesia and Africa which together represent 9% of KFC system sales performed particularly well. Easier laps at KFC UK were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another solid quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% same-store sales growth including 5% in the U.S.","As a reminder, our first quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC UK business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2 thereby having a full-year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum!","Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter, and 2% for the full-year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 5% for the second quarter, and 1% for the full-year.","Now I'd like to discuss our guidance. We remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm. As it pertains specifically to 2019; our full-year core operating profit growth guidance of low-double-digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high-single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of three factors. First the roll-off of special media spending in 2018 related to the Pizza Hut transformation agreement; second, the roll-off of the KFC U.S. acceleration agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC UK business as we just discussed.","I'll now update you on our EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus the adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release.","First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items, and any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment.","We estimated the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements remains $0.04 headwind to the $3.75. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecasts which will undoubtedly vary over time.","First quarter 2019 special items are $0.01 tailwind and first quarter Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are $0.05 headwind to the $3.75 figure respectively. Taking these items into account as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73.","Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchise, and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018, and with focus on our four growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient.","In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.7% of system sales in the first quarter and this remains the appropriate target for 2019.","As for CapEx, at our Investor Day we discussed it in three buckets run rate CapEx, targeted new equity units to spur additional growth that we would fund through refranchising of comparable number of units, and potential strategic investments outside of a run rate that would create incremental value for shareholders and franchisees.","I'd now like to elaborate on our thinking for 2019 including two positive updates. First, given strong returns on new equity builds, we see attractive opportunities to increase equity unit development to spur additional growth and generate excess returns. Again these incremental units will be funded by a corresponding increase in the number of units refranchised, so our overall equity unit count remains unchanged.","Second, we're now even more convinced there are attractive opportunities to lean in on strategic investments to generate faster growth and incremental value particularly as it pertains to technology. Importantly, much of this strategic spend is being or will be reimbursed by our franchise partners for services related to technology.","Now of course these initiatives will drive gross CapEx higher near-term and we now estimate our gross CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $225 million inclusive of base CapEx, new equity builds, and strategic investments in tech projects. However on a net basis meaning gross CapEx net of refranchising proceeds, we estimate closer to $125 million or only slightly higher than we've previously discussed.","Please note 2019 does include a small incremental benefit from timing as we collect certain trailing proceeds related to our previous refranchising initiatives.","One consequence of this outlook is that CapEx may exceed depreciation and amortization over the next few years which could push our free cash flow conversion below 100% depending on the absolute level of spend in a given year. To be clear, we're excited by recent returns on investments beyond our base CapEx and believe that through a measured approach, we can enhance growth and value creation for both our franchise partners and shareholders.","As for capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the three-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $106 million at an average price of $94. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.4 billion in over two years of this program.","Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with unmatched franchise operating capability. I'll start with Taco Bell. As I recently had the opportunity to attend their 2019 Franchise Owners Forum where franchisees from all over the U.S. share their enthusiasm for the brand. I'm truly impressed by the spirit, the positive spirit, and growth mindset of all these franchise partners. In regards to operating initiatives, their fast and friendly obsession is all about world-class service to our customers not simply speed and efficiency. This is exactly why initiatives like this are so powerful because of efforts like this by our franchise partners, restaurant managers, and employees that customer satisfaction and friendliness increased by two points year-over-year.","Lastly during the quarter, each of our service measures improved with the highlight being transaction times dropping nine seconds from the previous year.","At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our hot fast and reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've improved our percentage of orders delivered in under 30 minutes by three percentage points year-over-year.","At Pizza Hut International, we're continuing to run workshops on speed and taste with our franchise partners. As a result, overall customer satisfaction scores have improved in these markets which include India, France, Indonesia, and Australia. Each increase their overall customer satisfaction score by 5% or more.","KFC continues to drive taste as the key differentiator for the brand with a focus on elevating the role of the cook. This year we are hosting Taste Talks across the globe to ensure finger licking good quality in every bite. We have seen improvements across the board on sharing proven ideas and global best practices such as open kitchen tours and Fast Fridays. Each of these examples show how we are leveraging our scale to adopt and share the best ideas.","Next to bold restaurant development. During the quarter, we opened 310 net new units. This represents a step-up in development from our recent historical rates, keeping us on track for 2019 to be the fourth consecutive year of increasing net new unit openings.","At KFC, strong development trends continued into 2019 with 265 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia, and Latin America, and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continue to strive for positive net new unit growth, while at the same time we continue to transform our asset base to the American Showman Image. We closed out the quarter with over 1,500 American Showman restaurants across the country as 65 remodels were completed in the U.S. during the quarter.","Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 23 net new units during the quarter. Among those four urban and Cantina asset formats opened including restaurants in New York and San Diego where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns and outperforming our closest competitors. Internationally, Taco Bell opened 10 new units in markets such as Japan, Thailand, India and the UK.","Lastly, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. The integration is off to a great start with our transition tasks largely complete. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza has worked closely on transferring and integrating Pizza Hut franchisees into their systems. Further even during the most intense period for integration, Telepizza reported positive net new unit growth and has begun converting Telepizza units to the Pizza Hut brand. As a reminder, we still anticipate between 100 and 150 units may close over time due to overlap though minimal of these closures have occurred thus far.","To summarize, the first quarter was consistent with our expectations which included future [indiscernible] for the first half of the year. We're pleased with the results as they set us up to deliver on our commitments. The three category leading iconic brands that uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants Yum! is well-positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics, while leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology. We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019.","Now the team and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Hi, thanks very much. David, can you just go back and just clarify the CapEx increases this year and potentially next year and what the difference between gross and net would be, do you expect franchisee to contribute something to that or do you expect to get returns from that capital and technology because you're going to pay an incremental fee. And what is the metric if you could describe a little bit more just what the nature of those capital -- incremental capital investments are? That would be helpful. Thanks.","David Gibbs","Sure, John. We talked about this a little bit at the Investor Day, when I presented what the $100 million of run rate CapEx and noted that we were contemplating an increase in equity development and also that we were seeing good opportunities to invest further capital to create more shareholder value and improve the strength of our business. That's pretty much how this is playing out. So the original $100 million of run rate capital hasn't really changed. What's changed is our interest in building a little bit more equity units, all of which will be -- the capital for that will all be generated by refranchising a comparable number of units.","In fact the math on that is such that and this is why it's such a great shareholder value enhancing move. We get more money when we sell a store than it costs to build a new store. So we might get on average $2.5 million every time we sell a store and it costs more like a $1.5 million or less to build a new store.","So we're seeing sort of an arbitrage opportunity there to help spur development in certain parts of the country particularly with Taco Bell where we do own a decent amount of equity stores. Some of the best examples are in your backyard in New York City where I was a couple of weeks ago visiting some of those great new Taco Bell's that have opened those stores are worth substantially more than what we paid to build them.","So we're going to build probably more 40 maybe 50 equity stores this year when the original plans were only to build five to 10. So that's driving some of the incremental CapEx.","And then on the other side of the equation on strategic investments, we're looking at things like the recent acquisition we announced in the fourth quarter of QuickOrder where we bought the e-commerce provider for Pizza Hut which I can tell you we're just one quarter in but has worked out incredibly well. Just actually this past weekend, left the Pizza Hut franchise convention and I was talking to some of the Pizza Hut franchisees there about us now owning QuickOrder and they are really excited about our ability to create enhancements real time on that platform and just having a lot more control over their tech future.","But on the Pizza Hut platform, for example, there is a significant investment made to purchase that in Q4. It has some follow-on CapEx investment this year, we go through some contingency to the purchase price and then there's capitalized G&A that comes along with making investments in tech companies. So some of that is going to start to show up on our CapEx line.","The good news is, as you noted, John, is we are recovering a lot of that -- a lot of our investment through service fees that franchisees pay for these to access these platforms. Again our commitment to the franchise community is we're going to give them the best technology at the best price but you'll see us recover the cost of these platforms which is why we say this is great for our franchisees, for our customers, and for our shareholders. So if you break the $225 million gross down the excess above the $100 million run rate that we had quoted before about half of that is due to equity development and half of that is due to technology and strategic investments.","Keith Siegner","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit more about KFC, such an impressive comp, 5% driven by that international strength. Greg, you drove into a couple of drivers in your prepared remarks lapping the UK issues and we also heard from Yum! China this week. But I'm really trying to figure out more about this inflection and why it happened now and how sustainable it is. Are you really seeing the consumer outside the U.S. start to inflect here and is your delivery initiatives you've talked about for a couple of years outside the U.S. really starting to drive some incremental momentum for you now. Just any other color you can add to that KFC momentum?","Greg Creed","Yes, sure, Brian. I think it really, fundamentally starts with our focus on what we call RED, Relevant, Easy, and Distinct. As I travel the world and meet with the KFC teams, they are amazingly focused on making sure the KFC brand is more relevant, it's more easy, and more distinct. Now in some markets, we may go as distinctive and not as good as relevant and others we go as relevant and they're not as good as distinct. But I think the fact that we got absolute just laser like focus on making sure that each KFC Brand in each country delivers on RED. I think that's certainly helping.","I think secondly, as I did say in the prepared remarks, I think the value like a pound of food for $3 which KFC U.S. run, that that may sound like simple communication. It's both distinctive and it's relevant. So I think that's great, the innovation that's happening. We're seeing a lot of great innovation, flavor innovation on existing forms and new form innovation also occurring.","And then, Brian, as you rightly said, we've got delivery in click-and-collect and equally in the U.S. we're excited that later this year we'll obviously do what Taco Bell has just done which is put marketing muscle and effort behind delivery which we think we will accelerate that.","So it's -- there's no silver bullet. It is really doing RED incredibly well; value incredibly well; innovation incredibly well; and a growing contribution from delivery. I think all of that is sustainable going forward and that's why we remain very positive about the KFC brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore of Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","Great, thank you. I have a question about Pizza Hut and it's sort of a two-part question. One is I know that you're repositioning the State and it sounds like dine-in is still quite a bit softer to go. But I guess I'm -- when I think about the U.S. so much a carry out and delivery business that the implication is that even that business might still be sort of muted in terms of comps. And I guess I'm trying to understand, is there a scenario where you're repositioning the state that's happening at a time when aggregators are taking away some of the growth that the Pizza category has had kind of to itself for so long. And then the related question is what are you seeing in terms of the customers on Grub find you through Grub versus the Pizza Hut App, is it -- I assume a very different customer base as we've heard from other restaurants but given that Pizza Hut is so well known for delivering Pizza, I was just trying to figure out to what extent the Grub orders are incremental? Thanks.","Greg Creed","Sure. Well I just say dine-in does lag by that seven points on the sales growth between off-premise and on-premise and so that is obviously a headwind that we continue to have to work with. I do think that the Pizza Hut brand particularly in the U.S. and internationally is doing a much better job at the foundations or the fundamentals. As David pointed out in his prepared remarks, temperatures improving, delivery times are getting lower. I think all of that is working, we're sustaining and we've got franchisee support to sustain obviously great value, so the $5 line-up. Adding Pizzone which is both great innovation and at $5 obviously I think will continue to help and you will see that play out I think later in the year.","With regard to your question on aggregators, I think it's -- there's obviously a negative impact but it's hard to measure what the cannibalization effect is of aggregators on Pizza Hut, on the Pizza category. I think what's exciting for us is that we still think there's obviously a huge opportunity for Pizza Hut in the $40 billion Pizza delivery business to do better. But at the same time, the non-Pizza delivery market in the U.S. is worth about $100 billion. It's growing at 15% and now we're going to leverage Taco Bell and KFC to take advantage of that opportunity. So, yes, a little bit of negative impact but I see this whole opportunity of growth and delivery to be an upside for us not a negative.","And as we've only got about 200 stores at the moment which are actually going through the Grubhub marketplace, it's not having a massive impact on our business. But I think the point you made is we are excited by the incremental customers we're seeing come through that marketplace. But obviously the vast majority of the business is still coming through Taco -- through our Pizza Hut traditional business.","David Gibbs","Yes, I mean and on the Grubhub piece, I think we are encouraged that there are different customers on Grubhub versus many of the customers that use Pizza Hut directly, so we are accessing customers through their platform in many cases where we wouldn't be able to access. That's why we're excited about the test.","Back to the other part of your question, Sara, on the dine-in in the State, yes, Pizza Hut in the U.S. is the vast majority of our business comes through the delivery carry out channels but still close to half the assets are dine-in assets and there is still a long process to take those assets often which are in the wrong part of the trade area and reposition them to the right part of the trade area or if they're in the right part of the trade area and oftentimes upgrading the assets to modern standard.","So the challenges of the dine-in in the state are very different internationally versus the U.S. In the U.S., we already have 90% of our business is off-premise but the assets are still a problem. Internationally, half of the assets are dine-in and the business has more of a 50\/50 split to it so very healthy assets in most cases around the world though.","Before we move on to the next question, I just want to correct a comment from the prepared remarks, some of you probably caught, there was a typo. As far as the 2018 impact from the KFC, UK supply disruption to Yum! that impact was 1% on core operating profit in the second quarter, not the 5% that was stated. So I just want make sure we all set the right number there.","Keith Siegner","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi, thank you. At first and there are two I think relatively small questions, in terms of Telepizza, I mean it has been discussed before that this transaction would be net neutral to earnings. It actually does look like it was accretive in the first quarter. So could you make a comment on that? And if there's some type of thought of what Telepizza will mean to operating income growth in fiscal 2019?","David Gibbs","We continue to believe that Telepizza will be neutral from an earnings standpoint. What you may be seeing is the increase in franchise revenues relative to expenses, some of that's more related to QuickOrder than it is to Telepizza. But again we think Telepizza from a long-term standpoint, it's a great acquisition for us, we love their management team and their ability to leverage them over our existing markets and we're excited about how the integration is going and what it means for us from a growth potential. But the impact in Q1 was flat. There really was a profit impact from Telepizza.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger of UBS.","Dennis Geiger","Good morning, thank you. I'm wondering if you could talk a bit more about the QSR promotional or the QSR value environment that you're seeing in the U.S. And if that's had any impact on your value strategy for the balance of the year depending on whether you think the industry becomes less promotional or not. It seems like your brands remain as focused on value as ever currently. So do you think there could be greater benefits as that gap appears on value increases? And I guess just kind of related to that maybe if you could quickly comment just on the importance of franchisee buy-in on value that you're seeing which it seems like your system is seeing better buy-in from franchisees here than most? Thanks.","Greg Creed","Yes, sure. So there are two parts to the question, look obviously the U.S. economy is in pretty good shape. We also, the GDP numbers for Q1 from the government, look I also do think though there is some sort of bifurcation going on in the marketplace which is there are certainly people that are making a lot of money and there are certainly people where value will always remain incredibly important.","And so I think that our focus on as we've said earlier building these relevant, easy, and distinct. Part of being relevant is to make sure we've got the right value proposition for every customer we run in the marketplace. So we're going to focus on value. We're going to focus on innovation. We're going to focus on delivery and click-and-collect as we -- as we've talked about.","And it really is sort of how that gets to your second question which is the ability for us to sustain value on all three brands is predicated on our ability to get franchisee alignment. And I think what David and I are fundamentally focused on is making sure that at the core, franchise unit level economics are getting better. And as they get better then obviously franchisees will hang-in on value, they will invest in new assets, refurbishing assets, they'll support innovation.","And so, yes, I think the economy is in pretty good shape in the U.S. There are people who are benefiting, people who are not benefiting. We're going to stay on value, we're going to stay on innovation, we're going to stay on building these relevant, easy, distinct brands. And I'm really excited that the brands have worked incredibly hard with their franchise partners to ensure that we can sustain this sort of what I call really strong model going forward.","Keith Siegner","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Just one clarification, then a question. On the clarification, David can you tell us what tax rate you've embedded in your $3.75 plus target and whether that's changed. And then my real question is on KFC development globally that number was very strong. If I look back at the history, it's usually Q1 tends to be the low point for the year for the number of units opened. So I wanted to ask is this kind of a timing issue where you're starting to smooth out the openings across the year or is this kind of real momentum in the development cycle. And can we expect that kind of step-up to continue as we look at the rest of the year? Thanks.","David Gibbs","Sure, David. On the tax rate question, the guidance for 2019 is 20% to 22% and despite the low tax rate in Q1, we still feel like that's the appropriate guidance for the year. If you look back in past years, we do have a little bit of a cadence of having a lower tax rate in Q1 that's driven mostly by share-based compensation that tends to get exercised in the first quarter.","Then on the second question on the KFC Global development, I mean we've been consistent in saying our goal is to ramp up the pace of development. We're pleased with the progress we've made. Obviously, Q1 in recent history was a record quarter for us in terms of net new units. And I do think the development momentum is widespread and will continue. We're confident that we can hit new highs this year versus last year. It isn't really sort of a timing issue.","There is a good pipeline of deals for this year and for future years. You saw lot of the upside as in most previous quarters driven by Yum! China. And as I've talked about they're happy with the returns they're getting for KFC China so lots of reasons to be optimistic about global development.","Keith Siegner","Operator, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our final question will come from the line of Chris O'Cull of Stifel.","Chris O\u2019Cull","Thanks. Could you guys talk about how customers are using the KFC delivery in the 2,200 stores in the U.S.? I mean what day parts are consumers using, is it more large party orders, individual orders, is it over under indexed with bone-in or boneless product. Any insights into how U.S. consumers are using delivery at KFC could be helpful.","Greg Creed","Sure, Chris. It tends to be more focused, the dinner it tends to be larger packs. I always jokingly said, I think the Kernel 60 years ago invented the bucket realizing that one day we'd be delivering it because it's the perfect delivery vehicle. So I think what we're seeing is what we expected to see which is sort of a focus on dinner, a focus on big packs bone-in, and obviously it's incremental. And as I said, I think the bucket is a incredible delivery device. It really delivers piping hot, great tasting food. And I think that's also a benefit that the KFC customer is currently seeing which is getting restaurant quality food delivered to your house.","So all going well. I'm looking forward to the launch of KFC delivery in the U.S. later in the year which I think will be an exciting time and we think obviously positive things will come out of that as well.","Greg Creed","Okay. Just some closing remarks. First of all, I want to thank you, thank everyone for being on the call today.","Second, I'm pleased that we're off to a strong start in 2019. In fact when I look at the metrics that best indicate the underlying health of the business, so those without noise some special items or mark-to-market on our Grub, our investment in Grubhub. I think there's a lot to be excited about. We delivered 8% system sales growth, 12% core operating profit growth, and 18% EPS growth. So I'm very confident that our enviable business underpinned by unrivaled culture will deliver lasting growth that maximizes shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. Thanks for being on the call with us today.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"22983":["Yum!

All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.","In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum!

Investor event. Our 2014 New York Investor and Analysts Conference will be on Thursday, December 11, in Midtown, Manhattan. And our fourth quarter earnings release will be on Wednesday, February 4.","With this, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Novak.","David Novak","","Okay. Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Despite the recent supplier incident in China which has impacted China sales and reduced our full year EPS outlook, I am absolutely confident in Yum! Brands' ability to deliver strong, sustainable growth in the years ahead. And here is what, we fully expect China to fully recover. KFC Global is having a strong year and building momentum. Taco Bell has successfully and profitably introduced breakfast and is now expanding in the United States with new unit growth. And Pizza Hut Global should have a strong 2015 led by an expected US turnaround, which is in its early stages. ","For the third quarter, earning per share increased 3% excluding special items. We clearly had unexpected negative sales in China and continued soft performance at our Pizza Hut Division. On the positive side, we delivered solid results at our KFC and Taco Bell Divisions, and have the benefit of overlapping a higher tax rate in the prior year. Importantly, our China sales are on the path to recovery and we expect a strong bounce back in 2015. ","Now while it is clearly yesterday's newspaper, let me remind everyone that through the first half of the year, we are well on our way delivering on our objective of at least 20% full year EPS growth excluding special items. First half EPS growth of 27% was driven by particularly strong results in China, where system sales were 19% and we delivered restaurant margins of nearly 20%. However, our strong first half results have been offset by an unexpected and highly publicized food supplier incident in China, which significantly impacted sales at both KFC and Pizza Hut. As a result, we are now estimating full year EPS growth of 6% to 10% prior to special items. ","Now I am sure you have a lot of questions about China. So let me get right to it. First here is what happened. On July 20, an undercover investigation was televised in China depicting alleged illegal actions by employees of Chinese food service supplier, Shanghai Husi, a division of OSI, which is a large and global food service supplier to many in the restaurant industry. To be clear, OSI was not a major supplier to Yum!, and represented only a small percentage of our sales at KFC and Pizza Hut in China. However, given our size and category leading positions in China, our sales were disproportionately impacted because we were mentioned with the same media weight as our major competitor, who was a large customer of OSI in China. ","Also the fact that this followed the December, 2012, poultry incident at KFC clearly didn't help. Upon learning of the televised report, we terminated our relationship with OSI not only in China, but globally. We also began taking unprecedented measures to further strengthen our supply chain practices in China to prevent and identify fraudulent and deceptive behavior by suppliers going forward. For example, we are now requiring standards for suppliers in China to install closed-circuit televisions and implementation is underway. We are also establishing a whistleblower system to encourage suppliers' employees to report any potential food safety violations. ","Unfortunately, no matter how many controls we have in place, it's extremely difficult to prevent a company from deceiving us if they resort to illegal activities. Nevertheless, we will learn from this incident and are committed to developing even better quality assurance processes as we move ahead. ","Let me be clear, we expect all of our suppliers to follow the law and we are absolutely appalled with the alleged outrageous behavior of OSI. In fact, their actions are under investigation by the Chinese government, six employees have been arrested, and OSI has publicly admitted to wrong doing. We are waiting the final outcome of this government investigation, and I assure you we will pursue every legal recourse available to recover damages from this incident. ","While we are doing everything we can to turn the situation around, what we need most right now is to get to time. As we've said before, experience tells us it take six to nine months to fully recover from this type of events, and this will most likely be the case with this situation as well. But make no mistake, KFC and Pizza are beloved brands in China and around the globe, and are proven to be absolutely resilient. We have complete confidence in a full sales recovery and expect our bounce back to be strong. ","Now this is the quarter when we typically share some perspective on the upcoming year. So as we look towards 2015, China is obviously the key variable. I am sure you can imagine it's difficult to predict the exact shape of our bounce back in sales at this stage of the recovery process. However, sales are on the path to recovery and we expect a strong bounce back in 2015. Equally important, we firmly believe we are building momentum behind major initiatives around the world that would drive strong, sustainable growth in 2015 and beyond.","Let me give you a little color on each of our divisions starting with China. As I said, obviously we have a short-term issue and we are weathering the storm. While primarily staying the course with our marketing plans, we supplemented this with the short quality assurance advertisement in August and communicated our action plan via social network. ","Our consumer trust scores clearly dropped but our research indicates that we are on our way to rebuilding trust. At KFC China, we have over 4,600 restaurants in nearly 1,000 cities across the country, which is more than twice our nearest competitor. Going forward, we are continuing the roll out of our new restaurant design and introducing new digital technologies to contemporize the customer experience. Additionally, we expect to build up the most successful learnings of our KFC menu revamp and we are launching new group of products in the first half of 2015. Our goal is to present even better KFC our customers will appreciate and restore the stronger business model we had in the first half of the year.","Even with our short-term sales issues, we still have the underlying economics that gives us confidence to keep investing in aggressive new unit expansion. Turning to Pizza Casual Dining, which is by far in a way the number one restaurant casual dining chain in China, and it has no major competitor. Pizza Hut continues to lead with menu innovation and everyday affordable value. In fact, 20% of Pizza Hut's menu is revamped twice a year with the most recent update occurring on September 29. ","We are also continuing to leverage our assets by expanding our breakfast offering into more and more cities. With this new sales layer, our long-term goal is to create and own a mid scale casual dining breakfast occasion in China on a scale that matches what exists in the United States today. This is a huge opportunity and we are well positioned to capture it. ","Today, we have nearly 1,200 restaurants in over 300 cities in China for Pizza Hut. We have a powerful economic model that generates fantastic new unit returns. So with strong underlying economics even in a temporary downturn, we continue to accelerate our new unit development of Pizza Casual Dining and plan to open over 250 units this year, further strengthening our category leading position. In fact, no other major casual dining chain in the world that we are aware of is growing units at such a rapid pace. Pizza Casual Dining is clearly a power brand with a great future. ","Taking a step back, let me put KFC and Pizza brands in China into perspective. Basically today at KFC, we have restaurant margins of about 15% on depressed average unit volumes of $1.4 million. While these unit economics are strong, this compares to restaurant margins of 20% in average unit volumes of $1.7 million in 2011. There is no question in our minds; KFC will eventually get back to these sales and margin levels. Remember, McDonald's has average unit volumes of $2.5 million in the United States. We firmly believe we are still early on in our journey to leverage our asset base in KFC in China.","Looking at Pizza Casual Dining, our average unit volumes have dipped slightly below $1.6 million, and we have restaurant margins of about 19%. This compares to average unit volumes of over $1.6 million and restaurant margins in excess of 20% just last year. Again, with breakfast, late night, continued innovation, a strong economic model and accelerating new unit development, we fully expect to get back to previous sales levels and more in the years ahead. ","In addition to our opportunity to grow same -store sales and margin, the biggest opportunity we have in China is to penetrate the country with new stores. Yum! Currently has five restaurants per million people in China with a consuming class is expected to grow from 300 million people in 2012 to over 600 million people by 2020. This compares to or about 60 restaurants per million people in the United States where the consuming class is about 300 million people today. We continue to believe we'll openly have well over 20,000 restaurants across all of our concepts in China. ","So in 2014, our new unit development target of at least 700 new unit stores remains unchanged. This means we will open over 1,400 new units in a two year period and we expect another strong year of development in 2015. All of which will provide substantial momentum for China Division as sales continue to recover. ","Now let me share some perspective on our three global brands divisions starting with KFC. Our KFC Division which is our second largest profit contributor behind China continues to deliver solid sales and profit growth led by strong international performance. Importantly, our international new unit pipeline remains extremely robust. We expect to open at least 650 new KFC units outside of United States this year, and grow operating profit in this division consist with our full year guidance of more than 10%. ","As you may know, we have nearly 40,000 restaurants in over a 110 countries around the world, 91% of which are franchised. We are especially pleased with our continue strength in emerging market led by high growth countries such as South Africa and Russia. Looking ahead, our new unit opportunities in emerging market are arguably the best in retail. With about two KFC restaurants per million people in emerging market, we know we have a long runway for growth. ","Moving to our more developed KFC market, we have very solid businesses in Australia and UK and we are also pleased with the progress we are making in the United States. KFC is in strong shape and well positioned for 2015.","At Pizza Hut, while we are disappointing with the full year operating profit and it will fall well short of our initial expectations, we are pleased with the progress we are making and expect us to continue in to next year. We sharpened our focus on value in the United States and have leveraged more competitive offers to drive digital activations. And consumers are responding. In fact, sales turned positive during the last few months of the quarter and our digital mix is now over 40% on our delivery in carryout business which represents more than five percentage point increase over second quarter. Our system is now fully aligned around competing more effectively and winning into digital and social world. You will see more evidence of this going forward.","Looking ahead, we expect to build up this momentum with a launch of further initiatives to drive same-store sales growth beginning in the fourth quarter. Our plan is to launch new advertising positioning, design to better connect with millennials. We've recently had good success with our Hershey's dessert cookie and bacon and cheese stuffed crust pizza. We plan to reinforce Pizza Hut's leadership, quality, innovation and superior value as we continue to implement a comprehensive turnaround plan. ","Globally, we are sharing best practices to drive sales growth and we are making focus to investments to accelerate our pace of new unit development, especially across the delivery and express channel. We expect to open a record 450 new international units this year for Pizza Hut and are counting on this number to grow significantly in the years ahead. ","Turning to Taco Bell. We are definitely well positioned to deliver on our expectation for a strong second half. During the quarter, we delivered same store sales growth of 3%, clearly outpacing the QSR category. Importantly, breakfast sales are sustaining with the 6% day part mix without the benefit of high launched level media weight. I would go so far as to say we are one of the very few companies in the history of the QSR industry to launch breakfast successfully and profitably in year one. Not only our breakfast sales largely incremental, but we are making money and sustaining it with margins of nearly 21% in the quarter. Without question, we now have a great platform to grow from. Remember, McDonald's breakfast day part is 25%. So this gives us an opportunity to grow on that day part for many years ahead. ","Going forward, we will introduce mobile ordering and payments in the fourth quarter and we have significant innovation plan in our core business to drive growth, balance of the year and beyond. With strong unit level of economics at Taco Bell, we are seeing an acceleration of development with over 100 net new units this year which represents a 10 year high. And we have even better development pipeline headed into 2015. We are confident we will ultimately achieve our goal of at least 8,000 Taco Bell restaurants in the United States. ","Finally, we are investing for the long-term and develop the great brands in India which will drive substantial future growth for Yum! KFC will be bigger in units than McDonald by the end of the year, Pizza Hut sales of deliver unit economies are getting stronger and more competitive with Dominos. And at Taco Bell, early results are encouraging with plans for accelerating the pace of development. ","Now to sum things up, in spite of our short-term issue in China, the fundamentals of Yum!'s growth model remains extremely compelling. As you know, there are three keys to driving shareholder value in retail. New unit development, same store sales growth and generating high returns. In terms of development, our new unit opportunity in emerging markets including China remains the best in retail and our opportunity to expand is huge. We have three iconic brands and while we have about 60 restaurants per million people in the United States today, we only have two restaurants per million people in the Top 10 emerging markets including China and India. This is a long runway for international growth and gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue our aggressive expansion for many years to come. We also see significant opportunity to grow units at Taco Bell in the United States and make it a truly global brand. ","Furthermore, we have over 40,000 restaurants around the world that have significant capacity to grow. And as I said, we are building momentum behind major initiatives around the world that would drive same- store sales growth in 2015 and beyond. Remember, in China, average unit volumes are well below where they were two years ago, and we expect to get back to these levels in more over time. We are making KFC even more contemporary, have huge upside at breakfast delivery and late night and are building off of our best operations in the world. ","At Pizza Casual Dining in China, we will continue to grow the core with constant innovation while we grow the breakfast and late night day part. At our KFC Division, we are sharing know how and getting better at advertising, innovation, value day part expansion mention and digital, which we expect will result in higher sales growth in the years ahead. We are particularly pleased with our progress in breakfast in Asia. The initial results of expanding our happy afternoon hour, through our learnings from Taco Bell, and the beginning of the US turnaround at KFC.","At Taco Bell, our breakfast day part is now established and already profitable. What's more, our dollar cravings menu is resonating, product and digital pipeline is full and ready for 2015.","And finally at Pizza Hut, we are making significant progress on the digital front and have a comprehensive turnaround plan now in place at our US business that we will expand globally. Additionally, we will be overlapping 2014 results which will give us the short-term boost in 2015. Meanwhile, our returns on invested capital are consistently been among the best in the retail industry. Over 90% of our restaurant outside of China are owned and operated by franchisees. We love the franchise model which will generate about $2 billion in franchisees in 2014. These franchisees provide us with a large, reliable and growing stream of cash, which combined with the profit from equity stores, enables us to invest in high return growth opportunities and return significant cash to our shareholders.","So let me wrap things up for Yum! brands. At our three global divisions, KFC continues to be delivering solid results, we are making solid progress at Pizza Hut and we are pleased Taco Bell is delivering on our expectations for a much stronger second half. We had an unexpected issue in China, but we fully expect to be on the path to a full sales recovery and continued aggressive growth in the years ahead.","Now let me hand it over to Pat Grismer, our CFO.","Pat Grismer","Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover three areas. Our third quarter result; our revised outlook for the full year and our capital allocation philosophy. For the third quarter, I'll highlight some key aspects of financial performance to add further dimension to our reported results.","Starting with China. David outlined why our same -store sales declined 14% in the quarter. So I'll explain how this impacted our restaurant margin which came in at 14.9% or 4.6 percentage point below prior year. First, same-stores transaction declined 17% which not only significantly de-leveraged our fixed cost but also made it difficult for our teams to manage restaurant level expenses, leading to inefficiencies in food and labor. Combined these issues to over negative margin impact of about six percentage point. Rollover pricing actions provided approximately four points of margin benefit but half of this offset by 10% labor inflation. Restaurant margins were also negatively affected by inventory write- off related to the disposable of OSI products. Collectively, these items account for the roughly five point margin decline for the quarter. ","Clearly, had it not been for the de-leverage and inefficiencies triggered by the OSI incident, we would have reported restaurant margins of over 20% for the quarter. We are confident that as we rebuild sales in China, margins will rebound as well. One of the thing I would like to point out about China's third quarter results, we continue to shift our new unit development program to a higher return investments. For example, year-to-date to Q3, 67% of KFC China development was in Tier 3 through six cities compared to 53% in 2012. Similarly, 36% of total China development with Pizza Hut Casual Dining compared to 23% in 2012. Over time this evolution of our development program will enhance portfolio margins and returns. ","Now moving to our Global KFC Division which posted its best quarter of the year with solid improvements in sales, margins and profit. System sales throughout was especially strong in emerging market, up 12% led by Russia, Thailand and Africa. International developed market also delivered solid system sales growth, up 6% led by the UK, Continental Europe and Australia. Profits grew an impressive 14% before the impact of foreign exchange, excluding a two point benefit from the overlap of franchise convention expenses. This compares to 8% profit growth in the first half of the year and demonstrates the strong momentum that we see in this business across both emerging and developed markets including our KFC US business which delivered 2% same-store sales growth in the quarter. ","Our Global Pizza Hut Division also posted its best quarter of the year, although still well below our ongoing expectations. While total same-store sales declined 1%, our US business which represents more than half the division's profit, actually turned same-store sales positive in the second half of the quarter. Despite this improving trend, operating profits declined 6% excluding a four point benefit from the overlap of franchise convention expenses. We are obviously not happy with these results. However, comparing this to the 17% profit decline we recorded for the first half of the year, it's clear that many of the turnaround efforts launched earlier this year including the digital initiatives which David mentioned, are beginning to have impact and are providing upward momentum in advance of a new brand advertising campaign in the US. ","And finally for Taco Bell. Again, their best quarter of the year. We've long said that Taco Bell in 2014 would be a first half, second half story from a profit, growth perspective. And the division's third quarter result certainly bares this out. Profits grew 14% compared to a 9% decline in the first half of the year. Importantly, restaurant margins swung from a 2.6 percentage point decline in the first of the year to 1.8 percentage point gain in the third quarter as targeted pricing actions and restaurants cost savings more than offset food inflation, which is unexpectedly escalated significantly over the past several months. ","Additionally, we are on pace to open nearly 200 new stores this year. Our strongest rate of development in more than a decade. Over 80% of these new restaurants will be franchised demonstrating the brand's attractive unit economics. ","The last financial highlight, I would like to draw your attention too is tax. Since the second quarter of 2010, we've disclosed in our SEC filings a dispute with the IRS regarding the valuation of intangible assets. I am pleased to report that we've resolved this matter in the third quarter. In conjunction with this, we made an initial cash payment to the IRS of $120 million, which was effectively fully reserved. Remaining cash payments due under the terms of our agreement are also fully reserved. In the aggregate, these additional payments are expected to be less than the amount we paid in Q3. Including adjustments related to this settlement, our third quarter effective tax rate was nearly 11 point lower than prior year as we lapped an incremental tax reserves that we recorded in 2013. We are pleased to put this matter behind us.","I would now like to shift gears and talk about our full year outlook. In China, sales remained difficult to call, however, based on current trends and expected recovery period of six to nine months, and the knowledge that this recoveries are rarely linear, we expect same-store sales to be negative for the fourth quarter. This is obviously disappointing, but I can assure that the team is working very hard to restore consumer trust, accelerate the sales recovery and rebuild margins responsibly. Importantly, we are continuing to build new restaurants and expect to open 700 new stores this year. Although, the current sales declines have dampened our new unit returns, these returns on average still exceed our internal hurdle rates. And because we expect sales will full recover, we are confident that our restaurant expansion program is not only extending our competitive lead, but is also creating shareholder value over the long term. ","Keep in mind; KFC and Pizza Hut are the leading brands in China with enviable competitive advantages. No other retailer has the scale, the development expertise, the advertising clout, the supply chain infrastructure or the people capability that we do in China. We believe that with the benefit of long-term macro tailwinds, the restaurant category in China will grow significantly over the long run and we are better positioned than anyone else to capitalize on this opportunity.","Outside of China, third quarter results at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are indicative of the momentum that we expect will deliver on our promise of second half results that are substantially better than what we delivered in the first half of the year. Trends are clearly moving in the right direction. ","Now when you added all up and include our updated 2014 tax rate of approximately 25% to 26%, we estimate full year EPS growth to be between 6% and 10% versus prior year excluding special items. As you would expect, the single greatest variable in this equation in China sale, which I said earlier, remain very difficult to predict. This recovery, combined with the fact that the OSI incident occurred in the middle of our peak summer seasons, figures very heavily in our full year results. We will provide an update on our 2014 outlook as well as 2015 at our Annual Investor meeting in December. ","Now, I would like to discuss our capital allocation philosophy. Our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash. Year-to-date, we've generated EBITDA of over $2 billion versus $1.9 billion in the same period last year. And importantly, we remained disciplined in how we use this cash. We concentrate our investments in high growth, high return businesses. And we re-franchise when we believe the franchise model creates more shareholder value. We have a good track record of doing this and this will continue. In fact, we've begun to re-franchise a portion of our equity position in Western Europe, where margins and returns have lagged our expectations. Additionally, as KFC restaurants in higher tier cities in China trend toward lower margin, we expect the franchise mix of these restaurants to increase gradually over time. We also have a good track record of returning all available cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. For example, over the last five years, we've repurchased 57 million shares representing 12% reduction in outstanding shares. And I am sure you read our recent announcement of 11% dividend increase. This marks the 10th consecutive year we increased our dividend at a double digit rate, one of only 12 companies in the S&P 500 to do so. With this latest increase, we also raised our dividend payout target to 40% to 45% of annual net income before special items. Our resulting dividend yield of about 2% compares very favorably to other companies with the similar growth profile. ","So when you consider the growth opportunity we have with our brand and the cash we return to our investors, we believe our company is set up to provide a compelling total shareholder return over the long run. ","So let me wrap things up. We are urgently working to overcome the temporary, negative impact that the China supplier publicity has had on our business. We are confident that we will bounce back in China and regain the momentum we saw in the first half of 2014. This combined with the momentum we are building outside of China, positioned us for an impressive 2015. Most importantly, we believe our double digit growth model will endure for many years to come. ","And with that I'll hand things back over to David. ","David Novak","","Okay. Thanks, Pat. We are reading to take questions but before I do, I want to point out that this will be my last earnings call as CEO, and the Greg Creed will be the CEO beginning January 1, which time I will assume my new role as Yum!'s Executive Chairman of the Board. We've been working on seamless transition together and I couldn't be more pleased to have a leader of great stature taking the helm. I have worked with Greg for over 17 years, he lives and drives our culture, he knows all aspects of the business call, he has worked on every brand, and he has been Yum!'s chief operating officer in the past, he has a great brand builder and what he has done at Taco Bell, I think has been absolutely sensational. The Board and I are absolutely convinced that he is just the guy to take the company to the next level. Greg will join me and take a lead at our December Investor Conference in New York. And with that, we are happy to take any questions that you may have. ","Question-and-Answer Session","(Operator Instructions)","Your first question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Hi, good morning. And first David, congratulations on your great run as CEO of Yum!, and good luck with your transition upcoming. My first question is really related to the China trends. And I know you mentioned the trends are starting to stabilize or improve there. I am just wondering if you could give a little bit more context on how deep some of the same-store sales declines were initially and perhaps what you are seeing more recently? And then related to that, what level of decline are you embedding in your fourth quarter outlook? ","Pat Grismer","Hi, David. I am certainly not going to provide specific numbers around what happened in any given month, but happy to speak to overall trends. Now first let me remind you, we had a very strong first half of the year where same-store sales were up 12%, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our brands. So even as we've been impacted here in the last quarter, we expect our brands to bounce back strongly. We remained very confident that we will see a recovery in what we estimated a six to nine months period because we saw in the month of September that sales were substantially better than they were in the month of August which was the month immediately following the publicity incident. So we are clearly recovering. We are also seeing consumer scores improving and that further reinforces our belief in this recovery. But remember, we are in the very early stages of this recovery cycle, so it's appropriate to be a bit more conscious at this stage when we are guiding sales. And we also know from our past experience that these recoveries are rarely linear. The other thing I\u2019d point out is that China's hardest same-store sales overlap this year is in the fourth quarter. So when you add all of those things together, our best estimate today, again based on current trends that we see in the business, is the same-store sales will be negative over the fourth quarter which as a reminder spans the months of September through December. But make no mistake, we expect sales to continue to improve across the quarter and again history tells us that our brands are resilient and we will be prepared to provide more color and context on this at our Investor Conference in December.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Great, thank you. And then maybe second and relatedly, is there any more color that you could share on what actions you are taking to restore trust with consumers? I know you mentioned the quality assurance campaign that you ran, but is there anything that you can share about what you are doing currently or planning to do for the rest of the quarter to restore the trends there? ","David Novak ","I think David, we basically have announced all of our action plans to continue to make our supply chain even stronger, and unprecedented things that we are doing to work with our suppliers. That's all been publicized. We had a quality assurance advertising campaign that was very brief, just lucky for now that we are clearly addressing the issue and that our food is safe to eat, which it absolutely is and has been and always has been. So that's what we've done. Right now, we are in the midst of just running our basic marketing programs that we've had. We are currently doing promotions around our rice based products, rice and chicken based products, and we are basically waiting for the business to come back. Like I said, the biggest thing we need is to give the time and that's exactly what we are doing as we are aggressively marketing the brand and hoping that time takes its course and which we are very confident the business will come back. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","Hi, thanks, and I will add my congratulations, David, I think by my calculation, you probably suffered our questions for 70 conference calls non stop. So I will lob in one more. Can you compare the rate of improvement in China sales this incident versus the prior? I think last time you lost some family business over concerns. So are consumers responding differently? Is there different kind of product mix? And also can you just map out the rate of improvement versus the prior incident in December of 2012?","Pat Grismer","John, as you know, two crises are ever the same. However, as we step back and look at how sales and consumers scores are trended in the two months or so since the incident, I would say that the trend is broadly in line with what we saw the last time, but again we are relatively early in the stage of this recovery and we continue to believe that we will see a full recovery in a six to nine months timeframe. ","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","Okay and then Pat, you had indicated sort of the breakdown of margins which was helpful. What in your mind was truly one time and maybe didn't do the math quick enough. You talked about some inventory or food waste. Can you just talk about what you thought was really discrete to the third quarter and what was just sales de-levering? And in the past you have been very good about moderating labor. Have you been even better and faster this incidence? Are you able to correct going forward at a more rapid clip correct labor scheduling to benefit margins going forward?","Pat Grismer ","Well, John, I would clearly characterize the extreme sales de-leverage as a one time event and this is not something that we would expect would happen regularly. And the impact to our business was quite severe just given how sharp and sudden the transaction decline was. And our teams did the best they could to respond to that situation. You know you never want to pull out labor too quickly because you don't know how consumer traffic is going to trend. And we want to make sure that the consumers who are coming to our brands are having a very good experience. Yes, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there were some inventory write-off that were quite substantial that translated into over half point of drag in our margins for the period just related to the product from OSI. So again I think that it was the transaction de-leverage that clearly was the big driver. And I would characterize that as a one time event. Again, have it not been for all the effects we saw of the OSI incident to our margins; we would have posted a margin and quarter of over 20%. And I think that's the better indication of how we are thinking about our business model longer term and what we are striving to get back as quickly as possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital. Your line is open. ","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. And congrats, David. Two real general investor concerns that we hear about and it might be too broad to comment today, maybe let say for the December Analyst day. And the first is that KFC and Pizza Hut brands in China are somehow impaired due to the result of multiple incidents happening. Are you seeing lower lows and some of these scores in a way that implies to you that these brands are getting hit harder and deeper with each of these incidents? And second, there is a concern that your some thread that connects these incidents, even though they don't seemed linked, maybe it's the fact the press is more active or there is an underline distrust at the food supply chain broadly in China but this implies that Yum! China has a higher risk of sales shocks going forward as well. Could you comment on those two concerns? ","David Novak ","I think the first one the research trends that we see are basically similar, so we haven't seen anything move one way or the other return. In terms of the impact in the future-- I can only tell you that we monitor and respond to social media 24x7 and we actually responded quickly this last time around and the sentiment turned positive a lot faster this time around. We really can't predict future. I would never be one to say that we could never have any incident like this again. And but I can tell you we get stronger from everything that we had-- ever happens like this we get lot stronger and stronger from -- we improve our processes that are already strong. Everything we can do to learn from and get better. We are really confident that the China is going to be a continue growth vehicle for us. We got 300 million people today going to 600 million people by 2020. This consuming class is going to grow, our brand are clearly the leading brands in China. Even as we take short-term sales process, our margins are still very good. We have very good business model as we go forward. I think what we've proven over time is that we are resilient enough and strong enough to weather storms like this. Now, hopefully we won't have another incident like this for a long time to come. Believe me, we are doing everything we can to make sure that-- sure that we don't.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. ","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital ","Great, thank you very much. David, congratulations.","I've got two for you. One, just specific to the China unit growth, you talk about this year being another year of that 700 plus. Just wondering whether anything that has happened over the past few months or perhaps the past couple of years leads you to change that view and we should think something materially different as we look to 2015, whether it is by brand or by tier or whether we are full speed ahead in terms of 700 plus for the next few years? And then the other question is just in your prepared remarks you talked about China and being obviously a very high growth company operated business model. The rest of the world needless to say is more franchise and slower growth. Are there any updated thoughts on whether you would ever consider separating the China business? It just seems like you are running two different tracks and they might be greater appreciation for people who would like to invest in one or the other but rather not both. Thanks.","David Novak ","We believe in our business model, it has served us well in the past, we think it's going to service well in the future. We think what we have right now is not a structural issue. We think we have a short term brand issue that we have to deal with. And our challenge is to -- in China is basically to recover and grow. That's 100% of our focus and a lot and I guess I have to rephrase it. I guess like 1000% of the focus that we have. The single biggest thing we can do for our shareholders right now is to put every inch of muscle, fiber, whatever you want to call it and turn this business around and get it back where we really know it's capable. And that's our focus. One thing I would tell every shareholder is that we always have a right to own philosophy. You have to earn the right to own. 90% of our business outside of China is franchise which I think you point out very well. China is primarily our equity business is where we put our capital end. And that's because we have great returns on invested capital and we've had cash on cash returns in three to five years. We expect that to be the same as we go forward. We think that will serve our shareholders very well. And we have that earn to right to own mentality and that's going to guide our thinking our structure as we go ahead. ","Pat Grismer","And Jeffrey to respond your first question around the pace of development. We have no reason at this stage to back off our commitment to continue to aggressive development. We will however continue to evolve our development program to pivot towards the higher margin, higher return opportunities as we have done for the last couple of years, increasing the weight of KFC new units in lower tier cities and increasing the weight of Pizza Casual Dining restaurant which again offers superior economics. But we remain bullish on the long-term growth opportunity in China. And we believe that we have the very solid business model that is currently under short-term pressure but it is going to bounce back and bounce back strongly. And provide the returns necessary to sustain the high rate of development. ","David Novak ","Greg and I are heading towards China in a couple of weeks. We are going to have the annual operating plan. We are going to hear what the team has to say. We have a very focused new unit tracking systems, where we look at returns and monitor returns on a quarterly basis and see other doing versus our internal rates of returns or CapEx requirements. We will sit down, we will have very, very discussion on that, with the shareholders remind that we have nothing to believe other than the fact that we continue our strong rate of development basis on what we know today. And I don't anticipate any new revelations. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open. ","Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets","Thanks and in addition to you David, please pass the congratulations on to Greg and look forward to giving him some hard questions going forward.","David Novak ","He is capable handler.","Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets","I can't imagine how frustrating this has been especially post restaging the KFC brand earlier this year. But you talked about staying the course, hunkering down, sticking to the basic motions. Just wondering, can you talk a little bit about that decision weighing that approach versus say going and buying back some traffic, getting people back in, reminding them how good the experience is. How do you think about those two approaches? If you could give us some color there that would be great. Thanks.","David Novak ","Well, first of all, we are working on marketing right now that really gets to exactly what you are talking about. Reminding people of the role that KFC plays in their life, the good time spent you had in the past, the good time you can have today and that we are contemporary and we are on the money in terms of what you are looking for in China as China ever change, so the marketing direction that we are taking I think is very similar to what you're suggesting that we do. When you look at value, value is a very important component of the basic quick service restaurant industry. We've got very good entry pricing today. We will have promotions as we go forward that will entice trial back into the business. We will -- we will be looking for massive retrial of the brands over time. And right now for example we are offering free drinks at KFC. So whether that's put into the right context now to get everybody in the country to come back tomorrow, I am not going to say that. But we are offering free drinks with a soup or rice from --rice purchases at this stage. So I think we are pretty aligned with the fact that retrial and getting last year's backend is clearly the goal and that's what we will be talking about at the KFC team.","Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets","Thanks, David. Pat, can I sneak in one real quickly? Just in terms of the margins to follow-up a little bit, are you seeing any major changes, like where is COGS inflation, how do we think about that? Also it is rare to see occupancy dollars down in that China business year-over-year. Was there anything one time that hit that line item as well? Thanks. ","Pat Grismer ","Nothing one time on the occupancy line but also in that category however would be rent large portion something, vast majority of our leases have variable component. So if sales come down and so do rent and so that was account for decline in absolute level of rent expense which fall for the occupancy other line. With respect to COGS sales, that's an area that's going to put a bit pressure on margins in the fourth quarter because we had three straight quarters now flat commodity cost in China, and we are expecting fourth quarter to show 3% food cost inflation. ","David Novak ","Thank you. Just one more point to that. Keep in mind that our advertising is also flat percentage of sales, so as sales come down that line will also be reduced. So thanks Keith. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Joe Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch","I wish you the best. A question on the China sales cadence again. I realize you expect improvement sequentially but because this incident was a second half incident I'm imagining the first half, second half performance in China was like dramatically different. So maybe to put it in some perspective, do you think the fourth quarter will be down less than the 14% full quarter decline in the third quarter?","Pat Grismer","Again, Joe, given we are at in the recovery process, we are not going to be any more precise and how we guide same-store sales. We do expect an improving trend consistent with our past experience. And we anticipate full recovery within a six to nine months period. And it just isn't appropriate I think at this stage to be any more specific or precise than that. ","David Novak ","We will know more Joe in December. Joe, we don't know, we don't know. And we will know more in December and we will update you in December with all the color that we have to provide you on that.","Joe Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch","Can I switch gears for a moment and ask one on Taco Bell. The 3% comp I think you mentioned a couple of points of price and a 6% breakfast mix. So doesn't that add up to the lunch dinner business being down pretty significantly at Taco Bell?","Pat Grismer","Well, there is no doubt that other day part are under pressure, consistent with what we are observing across the entire QSR category in the US. We feel very good about how the breakfast layer has added incremental sales to our business and has helped us to deliver same-store sales growth in the tough environment.","David Novak","I think the big thing is our margins were 21% when we launch breakfast. To me we are in different where these sales count. The great thing for us next year 4% or 5%, I don't care if they come from breakfast, late night, lunch, dinner, whatever. I don't care where they come from. We just need them. And what we have now as we have a lot more muscle in the KFC, in the Taco Bell box to go out and get those sales. I love the fact that we got 6% mix of breakfast and our margins are 21% and we know that McDonald has 25% of their business from breakfast. And it killed me for years driving by all those McDonald's that are full and before we even open up our doors. So I think this is like just taking our awareness and taking our usage of breakfast up over time is like the biggest new product we could ever introduce to grow the base business. And that the trade-off, the margin trade-off between lunch and dinner aren't that significant for us. So we are able to leverage the box and that's the name of the game. And when we talk to our franchises, one of the reasons why we really believe so much in breakfast as we thought this was essential for us so we would have more growth options as we go forward in the future. So I think it's just early days if you look at breakfast. Everybody thinks Taco Bell has a great late night business. Fourth meal, our Sunday, Monday, Tuesday breakfast is higher than our late night business. So we got -- we are building a pretty damn good business that's only getting better as we go forward. I am glad, Joe, that we have it in our arsenal. Now, we also launch a dollar craving menu which is being very well received. We launched that recently which we really pulls our value story. The thing about this is that these dollar cravings products are actually products that people crave, and they are really good value for a dollar. And so we think that's going to be a good one. And the other thing that we feel good about with Taco Bell, we are breaking new ground with mobile and digital and our social work is I think best practice not only our industry but for any consumer good as we go forward. So there is a lot of good news. I think the best barometer about breakfast is our franchisees are saying, stay on it. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. ","Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein","Thank you. So I actually wanted to ask about the China growth story as well which is opening 700 new units but actually the net growth looks a lot lower than that. So I guess the two questions are one is, ultimately I think that is what we care about when we are trying to figure out revenue growth is kind of net unit growth. And then also, is there any kind of mix shift going on there and is that what might have shown up in your occupancy cost, more closures in Tier 1 and 2 higher costs markets? And then I will have a follow-up. Thanks.","Pat Grismer","Okay. Thank you, Sara. First on the net units. Yes, we are concerned about net units. So it's not just a matter of gross but also looking at the closures. In fact, in closures there was a bigger story which was that disproportionate share of those closure were Little Sheep unit. So not reflection of the overall strength of our business model and the development opportunity with KFC and Pizza Hut. ","Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay, great. And then the follow-up was you said that you responded more quickly as time sentiment turned around more quickly on the China scandal and yet still expecting kind of the same six- to nine-month recovery period. So could you just talk a little bit about that? I know in the past, David, has said accurately that really time is your best friend but just this idea that you learned a lot from last time, you handled it potentially better this time and yet the cadence of the recovery is pretty much the same.","David Novak","","Well, I think that what we've learned is that no matter how much we love our brands and we do, I mean we love our brands beyond belief in our company, we have learned instead consumers have lots of options. They do not have to use us every single day and they can figure out when they want to come back. And what we've learned over time it really doesn't matter even almost a big, the issue there if there is a highly publicized event, it takes six to nine months to recover. Just because consumers are cautious when it comes to food intake. And I want to point out nobody was ill because of this, nobody-- no real tangible personal issue that took place because of this other than the fact that we were tainted by this. And it takes time and it was highly publicized and this one was really tough to take, okay. Because this was here we are going the safety behavior that we -- there is no process in the world I think it could overcome. And the fact of the matter is when I watched that CCTV event and I saw the coverage, you had McDonald's, Pizza Hut and KFC, mentioned in absolute equal amount and I would say it would be hard to argue that we might not --we thought they are more mentioned, okay. And it was like when I saw that I said oh, here comes six to nine months a problem that I was not at all surprised by this, okay. So I think that's just what we have learned. We have always said that with our business, we have a great business model. We have great brands, that we have the single biggest risk we have in our business is when we have any publicity around food safety issues. And now that's exacerbated with social media. We are getting better at responding to social media, but it's still out there. So if one of those issues that we are just going to have to deal with and hopefully we won't have future event.","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Amod Gautam - JPMorgan","Hi, thanks, it's Amod Gautam filling in and on behalf of John as well, congrats, David. The question was on productivity, could you remind us of when the productivity initiatives were put into place at KFC in China? And then secondly, where does that fall in terms of the priorities of the China team, where do they tell you they are in terms of margin initiatives whether food, waste or labor scheduling? Is there still an opportunity there?","Pat Grismer","You may recall last year we started to see significant productivity gains in the third quarter. So and the third quarter of this year we lapped those productivity gain and actually we added to them a bit. So the team remains very focused on sustaining those initiatives to drive higher levels of labor productivity. It remains a priority for them to continue to drive margins back to a level that they were couple of years ago. So even as we look to recover some sales pressure that team is not taking their eye off of the continued opportunity to drive high rates of labor efficiency. As a step going forward as we introduced newer technologies back of house that will provide next leg of opportunity on labor productivity.","Amod Gautam - JPMorgan","And if I could just add, how soon might that happen, the back of house technologies?","Pat Grismer","Probably in the next couple of years, next month.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. Your line is open. ","R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar ","Thanks. I had a question about the reach of the food suppliers' publicity in China. More specifically were there any noticeable differences in the same store sales results and the higher tier cities versus the lower tier cities and does the shift you have gone to over the last couple of quarters more towards lower tier cities helping the overall recovery and what I mean over the next couple of quarters?","Pat Grismer","We didn't see any meaningful differences in same-store sales performance or they impacted the publicity across city tiers for either brand. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open. ","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited","Good morning. I wanted to ask about your point, David, about the competitor set. So obviously you were mentioned, Pizza Hut, KFC, McDonald's, local brands were sort of swept up into this OSI issue as well. Can you just talk about your dialogue with the consumer, what you are seeing maybe in terms of your market share? Did they trade out into local brands; did they trade away from fast food in general? Just any color around your brand versus the competitive set would be very helpful. Thank you.","David Novak ","Okay. We have not been able to do a source of business study, okay that where we can really crack where people are going. So maybe the China team will have more color on that and we meet with them in the next couple of weeks. Be happy to share that with you when we have it. ","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited","","Okay, great, thank you. ","David Novak","Okay. I want to thank everyone for being on the call. There is no absolutely no question that we have a taken a tough blow but we performed well in adverse situation in the past and I am absolutely confident we will fully recover in China. And we will deliver strong sustainable growth in years ahead. As I hope we conveyed on the call, we are very confident about the future and Yum! is definitely well positioned to deliver on the three things we know drives shareholder value. The new unit growth, the same-store sales growth and the high returns which we are ever mindful of all three of these key dimensions of our business. I want to thank all of you for the nice congratulation. It has been a great joy and a great honor to be the CEO of this company. And I am really excited for our company to have Greg take the helm in January. And I look forward to working with him to help us continue to build -- we will be hopefully believes it is one of the best global companies in the world. Thank you very much.

","On our call today, we will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. ","Now I'll turn the call over to David Novak.","David C. Novak","Thank you, Tim. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report each of our divisions produced impressive sales and proper results driving 21% first quarter EPS growth excluding special items. This performance leads us to raise our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12% from our initial guidance of at least 10%. Our international business is clearly the growth engine that drives our company and comprises over 70% of our operating profit. Importantly, over 55% of our operating profit comes from high growth emerging markets. Yum!'s strongest businesses are located where the highest growth is expected to occur in the years ahead. This is a very powerful combination. We also continue to be optimistic about our ability to dramatically improve our U.S. brand positions, consistency and returns. While there is still much work to do, we expect significant progress with our U.S. business this year. ","Now let me take you through our key strategies. Let's start with China, where our strategy is to build leading brands in every significant category. Operating profit in China grew 14% prior to foreign currency translation. System sales increased 28%, driven by a 17% increase in units and same-store sales growth of 14%. These fantastic results give us even more confidence our category-leading brands are as strong as ever and well positioned for sustained profitable growth ahead. ","KFC now has 3,819 restaurants, with averaging volumes of $1.7 million in 800 cities throughout the country and continues to expand into new cities, as well as increase its penetration levels in existing markets. KFC is deeply rooted in China with its localized menu and broad appeal. Virtually all KFCs in China serves breakfast, which accounts for about 6% of sales. Nearly half our KFC restaurants offer delivery service and over half have 24-hour operations. These service and day part extensions are all in the early phases of development and provide tremendous growth potential for years to come, as we further leverage our restaurant assets. This is all made possible through world-class operations and is a testament to the tremendous people capability we have in China. ","Pizza Hut Casual Dining now has 662 restaurants and is opening successfully across multiple tier cities. Its strategy to offer tremendous variety, everyday value and refresh 25% of its menu twice per year has consistently driven sales and profit growth. Our brand positioning as Happy Restaurants with the Western casual dining experience is resonating with consumers and driving success. Pizza Hut is, without a doubt, the #1 Western casual dining brand in China. It's important to note that new unit returns for our 2 leading brands in China, both KFC and Pizza Hut, are the best in our business with cash paybacks within 3 years. We also continue to make progress developing our emerging brands in China. Pizza Hut Home Service now has 136 units in 15 cities; and East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, has 29 restaurants in 8 cities. ","We're also happy to bring Little Sheep, the leading hot-pot casual dining concept based in China, into the Yum! China portfolio. We acquired Little Sheep in February, and we're looking forward to strengthening its operating model and increasing its market leadership position. We're very excited about the long-term potential of this brand, and we'll make the necessary investments required to ensure its success. ","Now as you are surely aware, long-term economic trends are also working in our favor in China. Rising incomes are making our brands even more affordable for an increasing number of people, and the consuming class is expected to double over the next 10 years to well over 600 million consumers. With this as an overwhelming macro tailwind, our new unit development will continue at a high rate, and we expect to continue to grow same-store sales. As you know, our long-term model is to grow same-store sales at least 5% as we continue to drive record new unit development. ","Now moving on to Yum! Restaurants International where our strategy is to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere. In the first quarter, we grew operating profit 9% in constant currency. System sales increased 8%, it's driven by net new unit development of 3% and same-store sales growth of 5%. Importantly, 91% of our new units were opened by franchisees. We simply love the franchise business because we generate a steady flow of operating profit growth from franchise fees while our franchisees capitalize the business, which translates to phenomenal returns for Yum! shareholders. We also continue to have strong results in high-growth emerging markets. System sales in emerging markets at Yum! Restaurants International grew 13% and over 60% of our new restaurants were opened in emerging markets. ","We're especially pleased with our sales performance in Russia. Last year, Russia lead our entire system and same-store sales growth. This continues to be the case so far this year. We're rebranding KFC Rostik's to standalone KFCs and have increased -- and have the increasing confidence we can build a strong profitable business in Russia. ","We are also driving major growth in the continent of Africa, building up our base of 656 stores in South Africa. We plan to enter several additional African countries in 2012 in addition to expanding our business in South Africa. We expect to have restaurants at about 20 African countries by the end of the year. With over 1 billion people throughout the continent, we know we're just getting started. ","In addition to our progress in emerging markets, we're making solid progress in France and Germany. Our restaurants in France have the highest average unit volumes in the world for Yum!, and we continue to build our scale and increase television advertising. In fact, we expect to be on television 27 weeks this year, that compares to 7 weeks in 2010. France is also the first market where we're utilizing a business rental program to drive new unit development and returns. And we've taken this approach to Germany, where we should have the necessary scale to use television advertising next year. ","We have 136 KFCs in France and 77 in Germany today. Our challenge going forward is to secure great sites as fast as our people capability allows. So while France and Germany are certainly developed countries, they are clearly emerging businesses for Yum! brands. These 2 countries are on the ground floor. Today, our business in Western Europe is minimal, but the upside is enormous. McDonald's makes well over $1 billion in these 2 countries alone. ","Now on to India, our newest division, where we expect to open 100 new units this year. In fact, we're so excited about our prospects in India and its impact on the future growth of Yum! that beginning this quarter, we've broken it out as a separate division. System sales increased 34% in the first quarter due to aggressive new unit development and same-store sales growth of 8%. Even better, our business model is getting stronger every day, working in both large and smaller cities. Our new unit progress with KFC in India is very similar to what we saw in China during its first 10 years. And while we don't anticipate meaningful profit contributions from our India division this year, we are laying the foundation for this business to have a significant impact on Yum!'s profit growth in the future. ","In the United States, our strategy is to dramatically improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. The good news is, we're off to a great start this year with operating profit up 27% in the first quarter. Taco Bell lead the way with 6% same-store sales growth and this should only get better in the second quarter with the historic launch of the Doritos Locos Taco. ","Initial results from our first meal launch, primarily on the West Coast, have been encouraging, and we're optimistic about expanding breakfast to 200 more stores in the second half of the year and even further in 2013. We're also encouraged by an initiative called Cantina Bell, where we're testing a new line of products with exciting new ingredients like whole black beans, cilantro white rice and corn pepper salsa, inspired by a celebrity chef, Lorena Garcia. This initiative is designed to broaden the appeal of Taco Bell. Obviously, we have a lot going on at Taco Bell, and we're pleased with the progress that we're making. ","Our U.S. business is clearly in a position to improve upon our 2011 results, and it's really great to see all 3 U.S. brands, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut and KFC growing same-store sales and profit. We realize there is much work to be done, and we expect more consistent performance going forward. ","Before I wrap up, I want to update you on our biggest people capability initiative. We're in the process of training our RGMs around the world on how to take people with them to drive operational excellence. RGMs are identifying their single biggest thing in their restaurant that can improve operations and using our training guides to develop action plans with their teams to drive results. We recognize that operational excellence is the key to our foundation, and our goal is to make sure we are world class everywhere. This is the single most comprehensive effort we have going on at Yum! Brands that we're adapting and applying around the world. ","In conclusion, while the year is young, we're very pleased with our great start in each of our businesses. I'm encouraged by the positive momentum we have and confident in raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12%. ","Now let me hand it over to Rick.","Richard T. Carucci","Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to cover 3 topics: our first quarter results; some items to consider as we look into the balance of 2012; and a brief update on Little Sheep. ","We simply had an outstanding first quarter. Each division delivered strong sales and profit growth, driving 21% EPS growth, excluding special items. In China, system sales grew 28% driven by impressive new unit development of 17% and same-store sales growth of 14%. Operating profit grew 14% excluding foreign currency translation. Operating profit included $6 million of non-recurring expense in the first quarter related to the acquisition of Little Sheep. Offsetting this, our results were enhanced by the additional day from leap year, which provided about $5 million of incremental operating profit. ","As we look deeper into our China results, please keep in mind that our first quarter in China is only 2 months long and is heavily impacted by the Chinese New Year. There are several business features associated with the Chinese New Year. First, sales are typically strong around the holiday period. At the same time, consumers are usually a bit less price-sensitive than at other times of the year. And not surprisingly, landlords and retailers pushed to open stores before the holiday period. ","Restaurant margins in China were a very healthy 23.6% but down 1.5 points versus prior year. These margins were slightly better than our expectations given the high commodity and labor inflation in the quarter. Margins benefited somewhat from the Chinese New Year as the mix of value menu items was below the levels we saw in the preceding months. ","China development set a new first quarter record with 168 new units. Due to the early timing of the Chinese New Year, over 150 of these units were opened in January. That's just an incredible number, and it highlights the tremendous development in operations capability of the China team. It demonstrates the strong capability of our 900-person development team, both in real estate and construction. ","Opening 150 units in a month also requires putting 150 new restaurant general managers and 150 restaurant teams in place in a short period of time. Our operations and human resource teams did this seamlessly. I want to thank the China team for this very special Chinese New Year effort. ","At Yum! Restaurants International, we continue to produce solid sales and profit gains consistent with our ongoing growth model. As David just mentioned, we're constantly improving our competitive position in emerging markets while making significant progress in countries like France and Germany. Our restaurant margins were down 0.6 points. As we continue to execute our ownership strategies within YRI, we expect these margins to improve. In our emerging and strategic markets like Russia and France, we expect our margins to improve as we gain more scale. ","We will also benefit from the planned refranchising of our Pizza Hut U.K. Dine-In business. When this refranchising is complete, restaurant margins for Yum! Restaurants International should be in the mid-teens. Let me help put this in perspective. For full-year 2011, our restaurant margins at YRI were 12.4%. If you exclude the Pizza Hut U.K. Dine-In business, the YRI margins would have been 14.7%, an increase of 2.3 points. ","Finally, as David mentioned, we had strong U.S. performance. Operating profit grew 27% in the first quarter. I was especially encouraged by the fact that each of our U.S. brands delivered same-store sales, profit and margin growth. Russia margins were 14.4% for the quarter, an increase of 3.7 points over prior year. About 3 points of this increase was driven by good old-fashioned same-store sales growth. The bulk of the remaining increase was driven by the impact of refranchising. We currently expect full year 2012 U.S. margin improvement of about 2 points. Bear in mind, this is in a year where we have to overlap fourth quarter margins in 2011 that benefited from the 53rd week. To summarize, we are very, very pleased with our across-the-board strong sales and profit performance in the first quarter of 2012. ","Now let me provide a brief update on our balance of year outlook for 2012. Although we're off to a strong start and we are pleased with our overall outlook for the year, I do want to share some of the challenges and expectations we have in the balance of 2012. Our expected full year tax rate is about 26% prior to special items. This is almost 2 points higher than our 2011 effective tax rate of 24.2%. Our full year rate of 26% would result in a drag of about 3 points on full year EPS growth. We expect the year-over-year impact on tax to be severe in the second quarter due to the unusually low rate of 16.7% last year. This will materially impact our second quarter EPS growth. ","Next, I want to provide an update on our China margin expectations. Let me start by discussing our pricing strategy in China as our approach continues to evolve. Historically, our pricing actions have been implemented nationally and all at one time. Going forward, we will take pricing across our system at various levels and at different stages depending on the trade zone. This will allow our team to more effectively monitor the consumer reaction to pricing. ","In 2011, we had a 3% price increase at the end of January. With the phase in pricing approach, we have a relatively small impact from new pricing in the second quarter. As a result, we will likely see a decline in margins in the second quarter that is somewhat higher than what we saw in the first quarter. However, we are still roughly on track with what we outlined in our December meeting. As you may recall, we estimated that the first quarter margins would be about 2 points below last year. As the year progresses, we expect the combination of our cumulative stage pricing and moderating inflation to result in year-over-year margin improvement of up to 2% in the second half of the year. I'm confident the team will continue to generate annual restaurant margins of about 20%. ","As we look into the balance of 2012, I believe that this will be another year of improvement to our competitive position and our business model. Our new unit development opportunities are as robust as they have ever been. High return new unit development continues to be the foundation of our growth in China. As I said before, it's a pretty easy decision to pursue capital investments when you have average cash paybacks of less than 3 years. It's even easier when you know how much discipline our China team incorporates into this development project. ","Our ongoing model does not need the high level of same-store sales growth that we've recently experienced. We expect same-store sales to moderate at some point although it's difficult to tell when that will occur. The important point is during 2012, we are again building up day parts and initiatives that can help drive sales well into the future. ","For Yum! Restaurants International, our sales results have been mixed in Western Europe, and we expect this to continue at least in the near term. Our focus on our strategic growth markets remains driving profitable new unit development. ","In the United States, we expect strong second quarter sales at Taco Bell. The first quarter included only a few weeks of the Doritos Locos Taco sales. This has been an enormously successful product introduction and thus far, the second quarter sales of Taco Bell running higher than they were in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we expect same-store sales at Taco Bell to be in the high single digits or low double digits. ","In our U.S. business, the 53rd week provided $18 million of operating profit benefit in the fourth quarter of 2011. This benefit was offset with higher spending throughout the year, including franchise development incentives and higher-than-normal cost from restaurant closes. While the combined full year impact is modest, the 53rd week will have a significant operating profit headwind for the U.S. in the fourth quarter of this year. It will also negatively impact Yum! Restaurants International operating profit by about $8 million in the fourth quarter. ","International development continues to be quite strong. We opened 297 new units in the first quarter, and our new unit pipeline is solid. We are expecting to open over 1,500 new international units in 2012, including 800 at Yum! Restaurants International, 100 units in India and at least 600 units in China. This is the key growth driver in 2012 and 2013, and I am encouraged by this pace of development. ","When we combine all these balance of year factors with our strong first quarter results, we are pleased with how 2012 is shaping up. Therefore, we are raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12% for the year. Please note that in 2012, we do not expect nearly as large a financial benefit from the combination of ForEx tax and share repurchases that we have had in some previous years. We expect that almost all of our EPS growth in 2012 to be driven by operating performance. ","The good news is that we're off to a great start. However, it is early in the year, and we know that in a global business like ours, stuff happens. So I'm confident in the strength of our business. My experience tells me that we cannot assume the results like the first quarter will occur throughout the year. ","Now I want to provide a brief update on Little Sheep. As indicated on our fourth quarter call, with revenue of about $300 million, the Little Sheep business will add about 5% to our revenue base in China this year. In 2011, the Little Sheep business started strong, but struggled in the second half of the year. Operating profit was about $20 million for the full year. We are still in the process of getting our arms around Little Sheep as we transition this business into Yum! China. We will begin reporting Little Sheep numbers in our second quarter results. I want to reiterate, when you take into account transaction and transition costs, we expect only a modest profit benefit, if any, in 2012. However, we remain excited about having Little Sheep in our portfolio, and we believe in the long-term potential of the brand and we'll invest behind its future success. ","In conclusion, we are happy to start the year on such a positive note, and we expect to have a great year. This gives us even more confidence that 2012 be another year of double-digit EPS growth for our Yum! brand. ","Back to you, David.","David C. Novak","Okay, thank you very much, Rick and Tim. And what we'll do now is we'll open it up for any questions that you have on our business.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So many questions. First, on China. I mean, given your current success of getting units open, I mean, well above, I guess, the plan that was set the year ago. I mean, what is the gating or the mitigating factor that would prevent that unit growth from going up? Availability of real estate? Is it RGM capability of your development team? If you could just talk about what kind of capacity that you have in the system in terms of opening these units, especially as we begin to consider out-year expectations for unit growth in the division?","Richard T. Carucci","Let me just start with historically what we've said and what's occurred and then I'll get to what we expect in the future. Historically in China, it's really had to do with economic development and development of trade zones. And again, as we've looked at historic unit counts, they sort of plateaued for a few years, then they sort of jumped up and they plateau and then they've jumped up. It hasn't been a smooth, continuous increase. One of the jump-up years was 2011. And as we sort of said in the December meeting, that's really based largely on the China government 5-year plan and developing the city clusters. And then the other thing that would allow us to raise our number was the success of Pizza Hut Dine-In business. So those 2 factors really let us go from a run rate of 500 to about 650 in 2011. This year we said -- I just said we'd opened at least 600 units. We're obviously off to a great start. So our confidence level is quite high that we'll reach that at least 600-unit target. And it's really hard to predict when those numbers plateau and when they jump, John. I've been at this for a while, and even the China team is -- we have a hard time calling it in advance. What we have said is that our absolute numbers would grow even if our percentage goes down in terms of new units as a percentage of total. Interestingly, the January number was our highest percentage new unit openings in 3 years. So we obviously feel very good about our prospects. So the combination of the economic development plan, the factors that David talked about in his speech, the middle-class continuing to grow, people moving from the country to the cities, all those factors continue to make us very bullish that those numbers will sort of, I'd say, at least stay the same for a period of time, and, hopefully, at some point in the future, we'll have another bump up.","David C. Novak","Yes, the only thing I would add to that, John, in terms of long term and our ability to execute, which is always -- is the key, is that when you look at both operations and our development functions, we've got, I think, unparalleled capability not only in China, but I would say of any retailer in the world. When you look at operations, we have a highly educated RGM core. 90% of our restaurant general managers have at least a college education. Over 50% of our team members are students. We have 2 assistant managers in every restaurant ready to become RGMs. And we have over 3,800 KFCs now. We have over 600 Pizza Huts. So that's why we're able to open up all these stores so successfully. We're opening it up with very well-trained RGMs and well-trained teams. And in fact, our operating team in China looks at every store as a training store. So we're constantly developing the talent that can open up these restaurants successfully. Here's an interesting factoid, we've really started what we call a Whampoa Academy, which is our analog for a famous military academy in China where we're developing the -- what we think is the retail talent for China in this next century. We'd basically say the restaurant general managers or kids coming out of school that in 4 years, you can become an RGM, you can become a franchisee potentially for us or you can go work in another retailer and be totally well-trained. Well, in this past year, we hired 10,000 management trainees in 2011. That's going to increase to 15,000 in 2012. So we're really readying for the new store growth that's going to occur. Now I think on the development side, again, we got 1,000 -- Rick said we have over 900 people in our development function. 90% of them, which are based locally, that means they're out in the field, they know the communities, they know the cities, they know the trade areas. And our development managers have averaged being in our company for 8 years. So we've got a really smart, smart team, a great database, and we're establishing new beachheads, 50 to 60 new cities a year. And remember, we have multiple brands. We have KFC, we have Pizza Hut Casual Dining, Pizza Hut Home Services coming on, ultimately, East Dawning coming on, Little Sheep. So we're building the operating and the people capability to, hopefully, be able to accelerate our development over time. And as Rick said, we're obviously off to a great start this year. And I think the thing that I'm most impressed with is that we've got the operating and development capability to keep it going, plus the process and discipline and review processes that really make sure that we get the right sites and the right quality of sites. Each store is reviewed just like the very first stores we opened up in 19 -- whatever the year was, way back 25 years ago. It's approved by local -- the local team plus the RSC. They meet twice monthly. So we got unbelievable rigor around how to really open up great restaurants. So we're very bullish about China's development story in the future. And remember, I've always said this, the real story for China is development. The great thing for us is we got the harmonic convergence of development and same-store sales growth. And we think we're going to have that for some time to come.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And if I may, David, not to take up too much time out of the call, but when you look at China for the last 10 to 15 years, I mean, what opportunities might you have left on the table or maybe you should have done earlier, for example, I mean, whatever it is, of RGM training, of development, of how you're handling the brands and things like delivery, that you could perhaps apply to India in its very early days?","David C. Novak","First of all, I think that the China team arguably has done the best job of any retailer in the world. So the good news is, is that I think with Sam Su and the team we have there, we haven't left a whole lot on the table. I think what we've really embraced more fully in the last couple of years, which is, I think, unlocking a lot of transaction growth, same-store sales growth and building our base as we go into the future is that it is an everyday value proposition, making our brand more and more affordable for our customers. And we've always had great affordability, we even -- we're even more so now, and I think that's a huge advantage when you think about us being in the embryonic stages of building categories and building brands. I mean, if you look at McDonald's great success that they had originally, they broke the code when they had $0.15 hamburger. We all had those when we were kids. We're making our brands now as affordable as they can possibly be in China and we're doing it at great margin. It's -- we're building a great brand, building great trial, building the brand the right way. And I think that the good news that we have in India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, all these places is we now have what we call our emerging market group. They're going to China. In fact, they're going to be in China on June 6, and they're going to be there to really look at the China operating model and take that same model and apply it into those markets. And I know some of you may have had the opportunity to go to India. One of the things and reasons why India is doing so well now with KFC is that Niren Chaudhary and the team there, they spent a ton of time with Sam Su and his team. And I think they're doing a lot of the things that we did in China, great sites, operating capability, all of that is being adapted in India. And I think that China is now beginning to pick up a few things from India as well. So I think it's a great advantage that we have, that we can go to China and have such a stalwart example of how to really execute.","Richard T. Carucci","Just to add to that, John, I agree with David. I think when you're looking at a new country, the combination of brand building and unit economics is key. And fortunately, we have both those in India. I think the brand that we're building is KFC brands looking very strong, and we have the unit economics that we've talked about that are strong across the country. I think 2 specific other learnings that they took from China besides the things David talked about, one is that we're going to more cities earlier. I think that traditionally, when open up countries, we concentrate a lot in the capital cities and the biggest cities. And what we learned in China is that there's opportunities in -- when you have 1 billion people in a country, there's opportunities in a lot of cities. So in India, we're going to cities -- outside the major cities quite quickly. And the other thing is the quality of the people. I mean, and that was really from day one in India. But I know you just got back from there, the quality of the people that we have in India, not just at the management level, but the store level, is exceptional. And I know you always get a lot of confidence when you know the consumer is getting a great experience and then you have management that's as talented as we have there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Rick, you mentioned the first quarter is only 2 months long in China and then 2 weeks of the Chinese New Year being particularly important within that. And I think one of the implications of that is that this quarter is a far from perfect indicator of your business momentum there for good or ill. You have the benefit of seeing 4.5 months of 2012 so far, being able to see through the impact of changing promotions, value menus and whatnot. How would you characterize same-store sales momentum in China from where you sit, and what sort of range of same-store sales growth should we be thinking about for China in this year, 2012?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, as I said coming into the year, I think it's really hard to forecast same-store sales in the year 2012 coming off a year like 2011, which was so strong from a same-store sales perspective. On the positive end, you have momentum. On the negative side, you know you're going to be lapping some big numbers, especially as we get into the second half of the year. And we're not going to give a forecast for the second quarter. What I would say is traditionally, we'd let people know if there's a significant bending in the trend. And we're not sort of saying that there's a huge change in the trend versus what we saw in the first quarter. So we're obviously off to a very good start. I just want to also just keep framing for people that these same-store sales numbers were on top of just huge development numbers in the back, in the fourth quarter of '11 and the first quarter of '12. And I know we're used to sort of saying what are same-store sales, et cetera, but we look at system sales a lot and we've got 2 quarters of just unbelievably strong system sales. So while we obviously care about same-store sales, as David mentioned, we're even more concerned or more encouraged by the development that continues to occur in China. And my expectation is, as I sort of said in the speech, at some point, I expect same-store sales to -- growth to slow down, but I don't know when that will be.","David C. Novak","Yes, we really can't predict that. The only thing I think I would just build on this is that we're building a model in China that can incorporate a whole lot more average unit volume growth, okay? Our breakfast daypart is 6% of our business today. It's now national. But it's 6% of our business, okay? We have delivery, home delivery, business delivery, in half of our stores, and we have 24-hour service in half of our stores, all right? Embryonic stages. Value is something that we are doing now with our 6-1 breakfast, 12-1 lunches. So that's all geared towards making our product more affordable to this consuming class that's going to double in the next -- to 600 million people in the next 8 years. And then we're also continuing to innovate with rice and chicken-based dishes that are new and exciting and make us even more locally relevant. So the team is very set on leveraging that asset 24\/7, okay? And as we do that, we're at the embryonic phases of those dayparts and new segments. So I don't know when same-store sales growth is going to slow down. I can't predict that any better than Rick, okay? But what I do know is that the new unit opportunity we have is beyond even comprehension, okay? And then the same-store sales growth opportunity is clearly there as we leverage our asset. But our model needs, as we go forward, we want to continue setting records in new unit development, and we need 5% -- about 5% to 6% same-store sales growth. We think that, that's achievable from a long-term model perspective.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Further on China and what's going on over there. The macro is clearly slowing a bit. And you see it in housing, in PMI under 50, in durable goods and things like that. How is it filtering to your business, whether -- I don't mean necessarily just what's the comp look like, but what about behaviors in the restaurants? What are consumers doing differently, if anything? Are you seeing it differently in Tier 1 or 2 versus 3 to 6 cities? Are you seeing it in different dayparts or menu ordering? Kind of what's going on in the restaurants for you over there?","Richard T. Carucci","Well, clearly, given the results we have, we're not seeing much in the restaurants, right? So we had both really strong transaction growth, that 14% growth. I think it was 9% transactions and about 5% tickets. So we had nice balance there. We have not seen a change in attitude. As it's hard to read the macros in China. As we sort of said before, the housing -- they have a housing bubble in China. That is a real concern for people because they are worried about can they afford their house down the road. Some of the other GDP stuff doesn't bother us as much, and we've looked at that stuff. But one of the things that the Chinese government has tried to do is to become more dependent on consumption and make that a bigger part of their economy. It looks like they're being successful in that a higher percentage of the growth this quarter was consumption than past quarters. Confidence of the people had been stagnant for a while. That's actually picking up a little bit. So I'd say that the macro should -- I'd say, for us, the short-term macro stuff is mixed, but probably as much positives as negatives. And as David said in his speech, the long-term macros are still great for us, and that's in terms of being able to add units for a long period of time. So overall, we're actually comfortable with how the China economies performed.","David C. Novak","My only point is that when I read all these macro trends and I know that they're out there, and we're on top of them just like everybody else is, I haven't read anything anywhere, from any expert, that says the consuming class is shrinking, okay? And when people are talking about these macro trends, I'm not seeing the same people write about how the growing middle class is going to go from 300 million to 600 million people. This comes from outside sources, that's not Yum! Brands estimate. So I think when you're thinking macro, the overwhelming, the overwhelming macro trend that should affect consumer businesses in China is the fact that there's more consumers, okay? I mean, that's a pretty overwhelming trend. So Michael, I know you got a good consumer goods background, you might want to consider that one.","Tim Jerzyk","Yes, Michael, I would just add one thing. There's -- everyone sees the macros from all their economists and whoever they want to source from, but the one thing that I started to look at a little bit more frequently is the performance of our Pizza Hut Casual Dining business, which as you know, has a much higher guest check. And I think that's showing some really amazing things. Obviously, we've done some great things with the concept several years ago, and the brand is a leader by far and the consumer has responded to that. But in Q1, with 19% same-store sales growth, it lapped the 13, which lapped the 13-year before that. So we're talking about 45 points of comp growth over the last 3 years. And the last quarter was the most -- was the strongest. I think that is also somewhat of an indicator of the strength of the consumer in China.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the increase in the consuming classes is undoubtedly helping you guys, the -- one of the other side of that is the labor inflation side. I just wanted to understand that a little better, especially in light of what will presumably be moderating same-store sales in the future. It's been about -- labor inflation has been about a 200 basis point headwind for your for the last couple of quarters. Might that step up if comps come down to, let's call it, mid or high-single digits in a more normalized environment? Or is there any reason why you might be able to manage that down despite the lower leverage level?","Richard T. Carucci","Well, as we've sort of said before, we sort of see labor inflation as continuing for quite a period of time. And we sort of said when they set up their new 5-year economic plan, we expect that in the mid-teen level. And we just think that's probably going to occur for a period of time. It's actually come down a bit from the high points that we had in the back end of last year. So we think that's a normal occurrence. As we sort of said before, it's a dual-edged sword. We'll get the higher cost that we have to manage. We'll have to pass some of that forward in the form of pricing to consumers. But the consumers have more money to be able to afford our products. And that contributes to the growing middle class that David talked about. So if we look at that, it's just sort of a thing that's going to continue for us. We think it's going to continue for our competitors and everyone else. So we just look at that as sort of part of the background.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Understanding that you have a lot of interesting drivers to grow the AUVs across all your units in China, I'm still trying to better understand the comp performance of new units versus maybe more mature units. Are new units rolling into the base at much higher comp rates in the existing base as you build the brand beyond Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, or are you generating these similar double-digit comp trends in stores that have been around for a while given this positive consumer backdrop and your own company-specific initiatives that you continue to implement?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, it's not that easy to figure out, actually. First of all, just for background, again, for some others, our new unit volumes are generally 250,000 to 300,000 below our average unit volumes. And that's been going on for years in China. Now in terms of the rate of growth, on average, our new unit volumes are probably going a bit higher because they have been in the smaller-tier cities and in the central and west, which has been sort of outgrowing the rest of the country. But it's very hard to isolate units because we continue to cannibalize ourselves with new units on top of new units. So in the old days, you could sort of figure that out. Now it's actually extremely complex to figure out. So I think the way I think about it is think about those growth as similar, and that the margins are the same as the existing base. But they're smaller on average unit volumes as you go to, one, smaller-tier cities; and the second, more infill units.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one more quick one. As far as Pizza Hut in China, trends appear to be accelerating there, definitely saw that in this quarter. I was wondering if you could touch on anything outside of the positive macro backdrop that's maybe taking place at the brand there at Pizza Hut.","David C. Novak","Well, I think the big thing we have there that we've talked about in the past is we're changing out the menu every 6 months, 25% of the menu. We've got the value proposition there: Eat like a rich man, eat like a poor man. We have daily half-off specials on entr\u00e9es, which I think is quite successful. We're leveraging the asset. Our afternoon tea time continues to grow. We've brought in new proteins. We're actually selling steak now with the new pan technology, with the display cooking, and that product is doing well. So I think the team is really fully embracing the fact that we want to be the casual dining chain in China with multiple proteins and daypart leverage. So we have afternoon tea time. We will be testing other opportunities to leverage the asset throughout the day as well. So a lot of good news happening there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just want to get a better sense of how you think the U.S. profit performance could play out in the balance of the year. And, obviously, a strong profit growth in the quarter you just reported. If I look to the -- the balance of the year and the comparisons for the next 3 quarters, on a combined basis, really looked somewhat similar to what you just cycled in Q1 when you had -- account for the extra week. So my question is, was there anything unique from a profit perspective in Q1? And then as you look to the balance of the year, are you thinking similar type growth of -- similar type rates of profit growth are possible, or how are you thinking about that?","David C. Novak","Well, let me repeat a couple of things that I put in my speech just to try to look at what could happen in different quarters. I think first of all, on the second quarter, we mentioned that Taco Bell sales strengthened from the first quarter. So -- now with Taco Bell being a big driver of our U.S. business, we'd expect a pretty strong second quarter in the U.S. And then in the fourth quarter, we have the headwinds from the 53rd week, which was not insignificant. It's $18 million headwind in the fourth quarter. So that will skew what happens from a quarter-by-quarter basis. Obviously, you can't expect to grow 27% every quarter from an operating profit standpoint, but we're pretty bullish on the full year for the U.S. at this point.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney with the Hedgeye Risk Management.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","Actually, 2 questions. In the second half, you talked about a 2% improvement in margins in China. What's the same-store sales assumption that you have with that improvement in margins?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, we don't have a specific same-store sales assumption. The biggest impact we sort of said, we expect sales to moderate. But the impact is really -- inflation was very, very high in the third and fourth quarters last year. We got behind from our pricing standpoint. We think this stage pricing will start to have an impact in the second half of the year, plus we expect inflation to moderate in the balance of the year. Again, to put things on perspective on the inflation side, on the commodity side in particular, we said going into the year, we expected 6%. We had 10% in the first quarter. If anything, we're gaining more confidence that 6% is the high end of what we expect from commodity inflation. So we have that benefit plus the cumulative pricing coming in that should help the margin in the second half.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","But you do have an assumption for same-store sales for the back half, correct?","Richard T. Carucci","Okay, we just said less than what they were so far, but nothing we're going to share at this point.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","And then another company, consumer company, mentioned that volumes were soft in China because of the cold weather during the Chinese New Year. Would you agree with that statement, or did the weather impact your margins in China during the new year?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, we are rarely weather forecasters, or talk about the weather unless it was extreme. And so we didn't think it was worth calling out.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One on China comps, and then I promise, one that's somewhere else in the world. But on the China comps, can you talk about the composition of them? In other words, as you cycle the value platform last year, are you seeing incidences off -- ordered off of that volume menu declining, stabilizing? Can you talk about the impact of the non-traditional food at KFC, i.e. the more Chinese-centric food, can you talk about the role that's playing in comp store sales, some way to understand maybe how those 2 elements in particular have played out, and maybe how you think about them for the balance of the year?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, I don't have a great breakdown of the second part of your question in terms of the Chinese food yet. We'll obviously learn more as we get more time into the year. We're obviously very pleased that we have the variety. And we think that's one of the competitive advantages we have in China. So we love the fact that we have the food innovation, but I can't sort of speak to the specific impact that, that's having. Regarding the first part of your question on mix, again, in the fourth quarter -- well, just for background again, we introduced value in sort of towards the end of the first quarter last year and then more heavily in the third quarter last year. That's when you had the biggest shifts. We sort of said at the end of last year, we were sort of low double-digit as a percentage of people offering -- ordering off the value options. That percentage went down fairly significantly around Chinese New Year. Again, as we sort of said, people are less price sensitive. Early indications is it's going back about to the low double-digit range, which is sort of in line with our expectations. But we still have to see how that plays out.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's great. That's very helpful. And then on the Pizza Hut U.K. sale, you talked about in the notes that you got some bids on the business, and that's what created this revaluation or the charge you took. So is the expectation that you'll sell all of it this year, based on those bids, some of it this year? And then could you just remind us again the size of the business? I know you gave us the margin impact, but what's the absolute dollar size of both revenues and maybe operating profit contribution of that business?","Richard T. Carucci","It's not a big operating profit contribution. As we sort of said is when we refranchise, we'll make as much money as we're making today. So it won't be -- it will probably be flat or accretive on the profit standpoint. It's about, I think, 400-something restaurants, 450, in that range. So roughly $0.5 billion of revenue would be the size of it. In terms of expectations, we expect to sell the entire Dine-In business this year. And so we're going through the process now. So we'll see how that plays out. But that's our goal this year, is to complete the sale during 2012.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John West from Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's actually Jason. Just 2 fairly quick ones. One, could you clarify, Rick, on the guidance on U.S. margins, you said about 2 points of improvement this year. Was that for restaurant margin or EBIT margin?","Richard T. Carucci","Restaurant margin.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just secondly, going back to India, just the discussion there on sort of the similarities and differences versus your China expansion. I know in China, one of the important competitive advantages you guys have was owning the distribution model, which allowed you to get into the smaller cities a little earlier than others. Can you talk about in India, how you distribute products, is it similar to what you did in China, or is it more traditional kind of third-party partners?","Richard T. Carucci","We used third-party partners. Distribution is a challenge in India, so it is something that because of the infrastructure they're not as developed as China was at the same stage of development, it is harder to get product around. Well, that's really just the function of the roads and the infrastructure, not the quality, we believe, of the distributors. So we do use third-party distributors. China is really the only country in the world where we own our own distribution system. We didn't think that was necessary in India.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line Deepa Mochene [ph] with UBS.","Unknown Analyst","I have a few questions on Yum! India. Basically, the 8% SSD growth, what will be from transactions and what would be from the ticket group?","Richard T. Carucci","I don't know that, Deepa [ph].","Tim Jerzyk","Yes, we can -- we don't have it handy. I can certainly get back to you, if you call me after the call, or e-mail me, I'll get you that information.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, sure. Do you have any idea of what the price increases you have taken in the first quarter in Indian market?","Tim Jerzyk","No, same thing. Same -- I would say the same thing. Just give me a call or e-mail me after the call, and I will get you that information.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, sure. And another question on the same-store sales growth. Is this 8% growth exceeding your expectations, or is it below your expectations?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, this sounds flippant, and I don't mean it be. As we're in this stage of where we are in India, what we care about is really healthy unit economics, healthy brand and new unit penetration. So we want to make sure that there's not a problem with same-store sales, but that's why we couldn't answer some of your questions, is that we're not as focused in on it at this stage of where we are with development. Honestly, we're happy with -- anything positive at this stage is good.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, sure. And just to follow-up on the same thing actually. The 8% same-store sales growth, I think majority of it would be coming from your KFC business rather than the Pizza Hut business. You can correct me if I'm wrong, but SSD for the Pizza Hut business would be much more lower than the 8%?","Tim Jerzyk","No, it actually was pretty balanced. I don't know exactly from a first quarter perspective, but the trend across the 3 brands have been solidly positive, that's KFC, Pizza Hut Casual Dining and Pizza Hut Home Service. They've all been running solidly positive same-store sales growth.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, sure. And what has been the industry of same-store sales growth, if you have any idea, or QSR in the first quarter?","Tim Jerzyk","No, we don't. Same thing, I can get you that information. Just send me an e-mail at tim.jerzyk@yum.com.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sara Minotaur (sic) [Senatore] from Sanford Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It's Sara Senatore. I like the last Minotaur though. So, actually, so, one obligatory question on China, and then I wanted to move to a different region. So China, just go back to the line items in the margins. The questions are, one, occupancy costs, again, like those seem to be rising pretty fast and yet even though a lot of your growth is coming in lower cost cities. So just trying to understand that, if that's like sort of an inflationary index that's attached to your rent rate? And the other piece there, is there any part of the labor cost that is a function of how fast you're growing units, like staffing up or redundancy?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, I mean, obviously, there's something there. We've always been increasing units at a pretty high rate though. So the extra unit impact probably had some impact in the first quarter, but nothing we could really measure. We felt it a little bit in the back half of 2011 as well. But I don't have an exact figure to be able to give you on that, Sara.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then the occupancy question?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, I'm just looking at the numbers now.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So then while as you're looking, if I could ask about Western Europe. I know you mentioned it was mixed. Is that Germany and France where you're growing so aggressively, or are you talking about other markets? And then is it safe to say that's because of the macro environment?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, it includes France and Germany where overall, our results have been pretty good, but you do see, I will use the word choppiness. You'll see some weeks up, some weeks down. That's always a little bit of a troubling sign for us, and more recently that we've seen some weakness there. So the trends in Continental Europe from the same-store sales play have been more negative than positive the last -- over the last month or so. So that's what we're really calling out. Again, for our business there, we still care about the profitable new unit expansion, but it is something that we're keeping an eye on. And on the occupancy side, I have nothing that sort of jumps off the table at us. In general, on occupancy, we are facing -- as a percentage, it didn't really go up. So we felt okay about that. In general, as we renew leases in the top tier cities, we are seeing increases that -- in the occupancy there. But we are getting better mix in terms of more and more of our new units are coming into the lower-tiered cities which is helping go the other direction. This is why the percentage is staying, roughly the same.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of questions, one is a follow-up on that last one specific to the China margin and the components. I know you mentioned you're still talking about 20% roughly for the full year. We were obviously very impressed by the fact that food costs were down in the first quarter 20 bps despite the 10% inflation. Yet on the labor side, it was up 190 bps on what was, I believe, 17% inflation. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about perhaps the mix changes related to the value menu, or whether there were other initiatives that may have helped the food line and whether you think that kind of even flat or modest leverage is sustainable? I know you talked about kind of a new pricing structure, but if there's any color on that or perhaps what your best guess would be with this strategy in terms of pricing for the rest of the year? And then I have a follow-up.","Richard T. Carucci","Yes. Well, regarding the first quarter, it's exactly what you said, Jeffrey. It was the mix of the value menu was significantly lower in the Chinese New Year period than it was in the months that preceded it. So that's really what allowed us to have the phenomenon you talked about. Going forward, we're not going to have that benefit, but on the flipside, we expect to see lower commodity inflation. So we'll get results that may be not that far away from that, especially as also the pricing comes into play, to your point. So my guess is that the commodity, as a percentage of sales, when you take those into account, it will be modest changes versus 2011.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. In terms of best guess on the pricing front with this kind of new tool, is there any -- at this point in time, based on inflation perhaps easing a little bit and labor you said easing relative to the back half of last year, kind of what you'd think about pricing?","Richard T. Carucci","Well, and I just -- we think we'll -- because if you just sort of do the math, you'd figure roughly similar margins this year as last year when you add it all up, you need a couple of points of pricing to make that work if you look at the overlap from last year. So -- and we're not going to give exactly what we're going to do from a pricing standpoint for competitive reasons, but our strategy has been to lag inflation but then eventually cover most of it. So that's sort of the approach we're taking. And I think this is just sort of a different way of meeting that objective in terms of what we think is just the smarter tactic of doing it.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Understood. And then, Rick, just separately, as you think about kind of longer-term, obviously you got every year to the 10% annual EPS. And I know you talked at your last Analyst Day with your internal models a few points more than that, and obviously you've achieved very consistent growth, what I believe is in the low teens, for the past decade. So I think you mentioned at the analyst day that you'd be surprised if you didn't achieve at least 10% for the next decade, which is obviously a very bullish call on the long-term growth. But I'm just wondering, as you think about the mix components of it, would you think that, that growth rate would inch higher, I would assume with China being a larger percentage of the mix and growing faster, or would you highlight any, perhaps, offsets to limit such an acceleration, whether it be an increase in your investment or other reasons why as the mix shifts to the higher-growth markets that the earnings flow through would similarly shift to the higher teens relative to what you've been running considering the growth trajectory?","Richard T. Carucci","Well, clearly, the mix is a benefit, and that's one thing we've been highlighting for quite a while to your point, Jeffrey. The one mitigating piece I touched briefly in my speech is, we've gotten -- if you add up ForEx tax repurchases, et cetera, we've had pretty large impacts in certain years on those combined. And as you look forward versus if you looked at the average over the last 10 years, I'd expect the impacts of those to be less. So we sort of said going forward in our model, and we even gave a model for 2020, we expect a couple of points from financial strategies going forward. Whereas in the past, they've averaged higher than that.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. But other than that, it wouldn't seem like there will be any impediment, or you wouldn't have any issue with letting more flow through if the mix moves the way we're expecting?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, we're not holding back from our shareholders, Jeffrey, so if it flows, it flows. But our model has been pretty -- it's surprising when you think about how much we've changed. But our model has been pretty consistent as we've looked at it because the mix changes have offset what we talked about on the financial side. And so therefore, our operating profit growth is generally higher than it was before. And we expect that to probably continue. But the EPS impact has been about the same when you add it all up.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. Two quick ones. First, what do you think the weather impact was in the U.S.? And then also, obviously, the Dorito Taco Locos had really good momentum. And just based on some of the test markets that they've been in, how long would you expect that momentum to continue, you think through the rest of the year and into next year? What do you think about that?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, I think it's a hard one to call, I mean, the good news is, from our standpoint, that the launch went even better than the test market when -- and I think part of that is the team did a really good job on the social media side. And if anything, we've brought forward consumer, so it's hard to say, therefore, what the lasting impact of that will be. I think -- so I'll let David comment some more. On the weather side, and this is almost a religious thing with us, unless it's extreme, we don't talk about it internally or externally. What I would say is that the industry was pretty strong in the first quarter and that some of that may have been weather related, and some of that could just be the economy was looking better overall. So the industry did improve in the first quarter versus what it was in the quarter before that. So that could be an indication.","David C. Novak","I think that Taco Bell has been focused very much on sustainable growth plan for the future. I think as we look at Taco Bell, we take a lot of heart in the fact that our operating capability continues to get better and better. We score in the top tier in our industry on speed of service and accuracy. So that foundation is there and improving. Marketing concept, brand building, we just launched a new advertising campaign to really capture the charismatic appeal we have with the youth target audience with the Live Mas campaign which has been very well-received, very well tested. We think, well, that will get better and better as we go forward. From a product perspective, when we look at the core, this reinvention of the taco with the Frito-Lay, we think we're at the beginning stages with nacho cheese as the first flavor. Obviously, Taco Bell -- I mean, or nacho Doritos has a number of other flavors, we think we can generate innovation on the taco platform. Which frankly, we really hadn't had for 50 years. I mean the taco has been basically the same the last 50 years until we just made this innovation. So now, on our core product, we have a platform that is proprietary and one that we can innovate off of into the future. So that's exciting. The other thing we're doing is we're focused on broadening out the appeal of the brand. We're currently testing Cantina Bell, which is a line of products that was developed by Lorena Garcia. We think this is going to extend the breadth of the appeal of the brand, make us more mainstream with both male and female target audiences. So we think that's very important. And then we're leveraging the asset with breakfast. We're in 800 stores in the West Coast. We're going to add 200 more stores in the second half of the year. We expect breakfast to grow. So that literally -- those are significant platforms that we're working on to grow our business on a sustainable basis. Our goal internally, and I talked a little bit about this, is to add that extra $150,000, $200,000 of sales to Taco Bell and get to 8,000 stores. We think we can be a significant new unit developer in the United States as we improve our unit economics. So that's the goal. This year, we obviously have a lot of ammo that we're firing, and we expect to have an excellent year this year. The real key for us is to build off these platforms that we're developing so we get sustainable growth into the future and get to that -- where we can really get the new unit pipeline going again.","Operator","And your next question come from the line of Keith Siegner with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Rick, I have a question about the U.S. margins, I mean clearly, this is good number. And I know you said it was largely driven by the same-store sales growth. But thinking about the refranchising and the fact that some of these Taco Bells have not been up to system average, like if you could quantify a little bit more for us maybe what the benefit was from refranchising on the margins year-over-year in this quarter? And then it's really helpful to hear kind of the fully adjusted numbers for YRI, ex U.K. If you were to try to give us something similar for the U.S., if you hit 16% company-owned for Taco Bell and 5% for Pizza Hut and KFC, what might U.S. company restaurant margins look like at the end of that program?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, well, first of all, in terms of the impact of refranchising for this quarter's margin is about a point on a year-over-year basis. And so a lot of the impact from refranchising has already occurred through the -- because we are largely done with Pizza Hut, we're mostly done with KFC, so it's now Taco Bell. And the Taco Bell stuff we're refranchising versus the average margins for our system is a bit lower but not a lot. So I don't expect a lot more impact going forward from refranchising on margins. We'll get a little bit of benefit just as we complete the program, but not a huge amount on a go-forward basis.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you talk about the KFC China same-store sales performance? You have 13% versus Pizza Hut up 18%, and whether those check and transaction numbers you gave us are kind of similar across both brands? I guess the question is, why do you think Pizza Hut was so much stronger than KFC?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes, Joe, I think it just comes down to what David talked about Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut, to me, in China, and we don't talk as much about it, but it just had a phenomenal run the last couple of years. I mean, it's added a variety, it's added value. It's just clicking on all cylinders right now. So I would just say it's really the almost extra special performance of Pizza Hut Dine-In as opposed to its fundamental differences somehow between the categories or so forth. Obviously, they play in different categories, but I think it's probably just Pizza Hut performing in an unbelievable level.","David C. Novak","I think you got one that's A1 and another one that's A2, okay? But they're both As.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on pricing. The 5% check increase in the first quarter, can we assume that, that's mostly price? Actually, it sounds like some of it is mix based on what you've said already. And I didn't understand completely what you were saying about the staging or zoning strategy. Is that going to defer some of the pricing plans in China?","Tim Jerzyk","Yes, Joe, the pricing that we would have carried into -- or would have had for Q1 would have been the 4 -- approximately 4 that we took last fall, and then half of the 3 from last year. So basically, about 5.5 points of price in Q1.","Richard T. Carucci","And just in terms of the -- of what I call the phase-in pricing, I think there's 2 elements to it. One is that there's more differentiation between trade zones. So we're going to increase the number of options that we have by trade zone. And the other is instead of taking one increase everywhere, we're going to take roughly in a number of stages, maybe up to this 5 to 8 range across the country. And we just think that, that's just better from a -- being able to read the customer standpoint, PR perspective, et cetera. So we think that's just the better way to do with.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Rick, when you say 5 to 8 range, is that the number of zones or the pricing?","Richard T. Carucci","Sorry, that is the stages it will take us to cover the whole country, basically.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Do you think it would still price mid-single digit for the balance of the year?","Richard T. Carucci","Well, it depends on what happens on the inflation side, et cetera. So as I sort of said at the beginning, we need a few points to get to sort of the margin numbers we talked about.","Operator","And your next question coming from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham research.","Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Many, many of my questions have already been asked and answered, so I'll dig a little deeper and touch on some other things. First on the share repurchase, you did about $78 million in the first quarter. I believe $800 million is the target. Is that still the number to target for 2012?","Richard T. Carucci","Yes.","Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, good. Next, on the -- on Africa, you talked about it a lot at the analyst day, obviously, it's a big market. Can you give us a sense just x South Africa, is there any competition whatsoever on -- and when you think about Africa versus when you went into China a long time ago, is it less of a competitive set at that stage of development?","Richard T. Carucci","When we first went into China, there was also very little competition. So I guess similar. But no one's even talking about Africa besides us right now that I've seen. So to your point, I think the competitive situation is quite open. It's more challenging because you have multiple countries. But clearly, we think that if we get the political stability and the economic growth that seems to be materializing, it's a great opportunity for us. But as we sort of said before, don't count -- outside of South Africa, don't build that into your growth model the next few years. This is something for our 2020 vision that we sort of talked about.","Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Great. And lastly on Pizza Hut in the U.S., another strong quarter. Was it driven by the continuation of the dinner boxes? Do you see the category growing as quickly as you're growing? Any context on the renewed Pizza Hut momentum would be great.","Richard T. Carucci","We think we outperformed the category by about 1 point or so, I think, in the first quarter. And I don't think there's anything major different than what we've been doing in the past year or so to drive it. The team, I think, has done a very good job off staying relevant with the consumer.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Bryan Elliott with Raymond James.","Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just real quick, food and labor inflation in the U.S., Q1?","Richard T. Carucci","Well, for the full year, we sort of said we'd have commodity inflation of 2% in the U.S. So we ran a little bit higher than that in the first quarter, but we don't think we're going to have much of a difference on the full year number at this stage and...","Tim Jerzyk","Inflation is low, low single-digit. But the food inflation is -- definitely will be the highest in Q1 and tail off from that, Bryan.","Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And labor, have you seen any changes yet with the economic conditions firming a bit?","Tim Jerzyk","No, not really.","David C. Novak","Okay, well, I want to thank everybody for being on the call. Let me wrap it up by just saying that while we recognize the year is definitely young, we're definitely please with the great start that we have in all of our businesses. Special kudos to the China team and Taco Bell team. We're really encouraged by the positive momentum we have going forward, and we're confident in raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12%. And as you know, we're very focused on a track record of consistency, and we're very focused on making this another year where we put another notch up there for us.

And good morning, everyone. It's been a little over two years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then.","Focus on our four growth drivers, increased collaboration and a new mindset are clearly fueling improved results. In aggregate, for the year, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 5%, with 2% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth excluding Telepizza units.","Additionally, 2018 was a year of significant milestones in bold restaurant development. We now have over 48,000 restaurants in approximately 270 brand country combinations. ","Together, with our world-class franchisees, we opened on average 8 gross restaurants per day. Or in other words, one restaurant every three hours.","As for the fourth quarter, I'm thrilled to share details of such a strong finish to a solid year. Items to note include a tremendous quarter at Taco Bell where same-store sales grew 6%, another impressive quarter at KFC where same-store sales grew 3% and a continued slow and steady improvement at Pizza Hut US with 1% same-store sales growth.","Now, into the final year of our transformation, we continue to focus on our four key drivers to accelerate growth. As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of these four key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our distinctly relevant and easy brands, as well as unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will discuss bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. He will also discuss our 2018 results, 2019 guidance and progress towards our transformation commitments.","I\u2019ll begin with our three distinctive, relevant and easy brands. In the fourth quarter, KFC division delivered system sales growth of 7%, with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 5%.","For the year, systems sales grew 6%, with 2% same-store sales growth and 5% net new unit growth. The unit growth in 2018 exceeded our expectations, delivering a record 1,134 net new units this year. This achievement in unit growth was broad-based with particular strength in China, Russia, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. ","KFC also saw widespread contribution to its 3% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with notable strength in markets like Africa, China and Iberia. Africa continued to deliver results with 7% same-store sales growth in the quarter. This sustained momentum is the result of intense focus on value, backed by the introduction of the Zinger, an international fan favorite, and premium innovation like new Dunked Burger.","In addition, China reported 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter. This stemmed from transactional-driving promotions like the Christmas Bucket and Crazy Thursday deals.","And last, but not least, our Iberia market delivered 6% same-store sales growth in 2018. Campaigns based on consumer proximity, using delivery aggregators and that centered on the Mega Box Five Products for Five Euros drove the growth.","Importantly, each of these markets grew same-store sales growth, while accelerating net new unit development. Iberia, for example, opened 35 net new units, a 26% increase in units year-over-year.","Now, to the US where we finished 2018 with our fifth consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. We started off the year with introduction by continuing our Taste of the South series with Smoky Mountain BBQ. We then followed this up with the debut of our Crispy Colonel Sandwich in April.","In the fourth quarter, the team built on these platforms and debuted distinctive marketing and product innovation. The ","First, Southern-inspired Hot Honey Chicken was offered in a tenders basked or sandwich style. Second, and most notably, Chicken and Waffles featuring Mrs. Butterworth's syrup was a huge hit.","KFC\u2019s bold and cheeky marketing uniquely accentuated the delicious pairing to help KFC US deliver its strongest month of same-store sales growth for the year.","With continued focus on value and innovation, we\u2019re excited for what 2019 had in store for this always original brand.","Moving on to our Pizza Hut division, which celebrated its 60th birthday in 2018 by reaching a milestone of over 18,000 restaurants worldwide. This was in part due to our strategic growth alliance with Telepizza. David will give you more details on the alliance in a few minutes.","I want to note that we closed the transaction in December. And while there is no significant P&L impact on the quarter, certain Telepizza units were included in the Pizza Hut division restaurant count.","In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut division yielded system sales growth of 2%, with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 10% for the quarter or 2% excluding Telepizza units. For the year, system sales grew 1%, with flat same-store sales growth and 10% net new unit growth or 2% excluding Telepizza units.","If you joined us during our investor and analyst day, we mentioned being proud of the foundational improvements we have made, but dissatisfied with the current system sales growth of our Pizza Hut division.","For both the US and international business, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive.","International Pizza Hut systems sales grew 3% in the quarter due to a 5% net new unit growth, excluding Telepizza. We were pleased to see profits and same-store sales growth progress in the fourth ,quarter including in Mexico and Brazil. But, overall same-store sales were flat as dine-in sales continue to weigh on overall results.","As we mentioned during the third quarter earnings call and in New York at our investor day, the gap between dine-in general sales and off-premise is significant, with both the US and international seeing a roughly 10 point differential.","About 40% of our units outside of the US are dine-in restaurants, with predominantly dine-in sales and about half of these units are in China. We are leveraging best practices from our strongest international markets to provide targeted, alternative asset solutions.","In 2018, we found success in our off-premise focused asset options, including Delcos, fast casual Delcos and express units.","Combined, these modern off-premise focused restaurants represented 90% of total net new units in 2018, with particular success in India, Indonesia, Japan and Poland. The addition of nearly 1,300 Telepizza units will accelerate the transformation of our estate to a more off-premise focused asset base.","In the US, systems sales increased 1% in the quarter, with 1% same-store sales growth and a net new unit decline of 1%. We\u2019re encouraged by the operational foundation that's been put in place and continue to make strides to improve the brand\u2019s position.","Over the year, we acquired QuickOrder, our third-party online service provider. Running our own e-commerce platform will enable us to more quickly provide breakthrough products and convenience services to our customers that will allow for better franchise economics over the long-term.","In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut US continued its emphasis on value. The $5 lineup which features favorites like medium one top pizza, garlic knots, wings, and our new cinnamon mini rolls, helped improve traffic and provide the pipeline for future product innovation.","Our partnership with the NFL has brought attention to these value concepts and improved the distinctiveness of our messaging. Pizza and sports go hand-in-hand and our partnerships with the players and teams should continue to bring the marketing to life.","Now, on to Taco Bell, where 2018 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth, once again outpacing the industry, a remarkable feat.","Fourth-quarter system sales grew an impressive 9% with system sales growth of 6% and net new unit growth of 3%, a testament to the strength of their leadership team and partnership with their franchisees.","During the quarter, we doubled down on value in the US, with double versions of customer favorites including the Triple Double Crunchwrap and Double Chalupa. Then fan favorite Rolled Chicken Tacos finished the quarter of strong.","Taco Bell supported the quarter's value and innovation with distinctive brand moments as well, including celebrating our sixth annual Friendsgiving, with an exclusive dinner at our innovation center and launching the Taco Bell Taco Shop, our online retail channel that features some fantastic holiday themed swag that sold out in days. Both of these events generated top-tier media buzz.","As we entered 2019, Taco Bell remains focused on being a category of one for everyone. In addition to a relentless commitment to value and innovation for which Taco Bell is known, in 2019, Taco Bell aims to make it even easier to assess for access with our customers.","In fact, this morning, on the first anniversary of our strategic partnership with Grubhub, Taco Bell officially announced the national launch of Taco Bell delivery in over 4,000 restaurants across the US.","Fans looking to enjoy their favorite menu items at home can jump on to TacoBell.com or go directly to grubhub.com or the Grubhub app to place their order. This launch is an important milestone on our journey to make the Taco Bell brand easier to access, and I want to thank the Taco Bell system and the Grubhub team for making this a reality.","For Taco Bell International, there was a lot to be excited about as well. We took National Taco Day to more than 25 markets to generate awareness and drive sales. We leveraged US product innovation, like the Naked Chicken Taco in India and Korea and Naked Chicken Chips in the UK.","We have solid local innovation like the Crispy Potaco in India and we even have delivery available in 15 markets and our testing kiosks in several countries.","Unit growth is gaining momentum, with continued profitable growth in India, Spain and new markets like Peru. ","In the UK, development was also strong, including our first three stores in London where we announced our reentry into the market in a way only Taco Bell can with the help of Big Ben\u2019s chimes.","In 2018, our franchisees committed to over 1,100 international units under development agreements, augmenting our strong pipeline for future growth. This is only the beginning for Taco Bell International and I'm excited to see the brand grow and expand.","Now, on to our unrivaled culture and talent. As you all recently saw, the Board of Directors and I unanimously decided to promote David Gibbs to president and chief operating officer.","David is a longtime Yum! veteran and he\u2019s been instrumental in shaping our global strategy, accelerating the pace of global new unit development, executing our transformation and laying a strong foundation for future growth. In his new role, he now has direct oversight of each of the brands with the brand leaders reporting to him.","I couldn't be more pleased for David take on this role and I look forward to his continued contribution and leadership.","David and I, along with the Board of Directors, have taken a fresh look at our structure and long-term bench as we continue to focus on accelerating our growth.","Coming out of that review, we feel great about the level of talent we have throughout the global organization and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. ","This includes the recent promotions of Tony Lowings as CEO of KFC and Vipul Chawla as president of Pizza Hut International.","Additionally, we made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage for Yum! by investing in select new world-class talent.","First, and as we've already announced, we\u2019ll be hiring a CFO as David assumes his new duties. David will maintain his CEO responsibilities until a new CFO is in place.","Second, with technology increasingly at the forefront of our strategic planning efforts and given its importance to all four of our growth drivers, we\u2019ll also be hiring a new senior leader reporting to me who is focused on global, digital and technology strategy.","This new role will lead to a coordinated cross brand global effort to better leverage technology, to drive sales and better economics for our franchisees.","And finally, over the coming quarters, we\u2019ll also be looking to opportunistically bolster our brand leadership teams.","In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we are doing around the world, with world-class leaders focusing on our for key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum!.","We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value.","And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs.","David Gibbs ","Thank you, Greg. And good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiative and two of our four growth drivers \u2013 old restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability.","First, our 2018 results. I'm thrilled that we met or exceeded each component of our guidance, particularly reaching the high end of the original range for net new unit growth, which I\u2019ll talk about more in a few minutes.","Our consolidated same-store and system sales growth rates improved throughout the year, ultimately achieving 2% and 5% respectively.","In fact, I'd like to note that system sales growth ex-FX was 6% at KFC and 6% at Taco Bell, both impressive accomplishments.","As a reminder, two items weighed on our core operating profit results. The timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising and the revenue recognition accounting standard change. As a result, and in line with our expectations, core operating profit growth for the full year was flat.","As we anticipated, the second half of the year was better than the first. Fourth quarter system sales growth of 6%, same-store sales growth of 3% and core operating profit growth of 5%. Each a peak quarterly result for the year.","Taco Bell was a major contributor to the quarterly improvement, with a 9% system sales increase driven by an impressive 6% same-store sales growth.","Not to be left out, KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, ended the year on a high note with 3% same-store sales growth and 5% net unit growth, driving 7% system sales growth in the quarter.","Before moving on, just a quick update on the impact of our Grubhub investment on EPS. Net for the full year, the mark-to-market of our Grubhub stock had a positive $0.03 impact. In the fourth quarter, the mark-to-market had a negative $0.41 impact.","We\u2019re very excited about our strategic partnership with Grubhub in the US and the national launch of delivery today with Taco Bell and later this year with KFC. We will continue to update you on the mark-to-market adjustments each quarter.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our guidance for full-year 2019. Consistent with our communications during our investor and analyst day in December, we anticipate net new unit growth of approximately 4% and same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%.","Our full-year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single digit growth in 2020 and beyond.","This upside is primarily a result of three factors. First, the rolloff of special media spending in 2018 due to the Pizza Hut transformation agreement. Second, rolloff of the KFC US acceleration agreement expenses. And third, the expected recovery of the KFC UK business.","There is no change to our guidance from estimated run rate net capital expenditures of $100 million and G&A of 1.7% of system sales in 2019.","Regarding our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, since we issued this guidance in 2016, we have seen continued strong performance at both KFC and Taco Bell, though clearly weaker than originally anticipated performance at Pizza Hut.","Thus we remain on track to deliver this goal, owing to the benefits of our diverse portfolio.","As a reminder, the $3.75 does not include any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items we might incur nor any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment.","That said, I\u2019d like to provide a little more color on two of these items. At this time, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019, and on top of the $3.75% guidance, to be approximately $0.06. We also estimate the impact of FX rate movements to be a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016.","This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecasts, which will undoubtedly vary over time. We plan to update you on our FX estimates quarterly.","Now, turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders.","First, being more focused means we are maniacal about our four key growth drivers as they are the key to achieving our bold aspiration of 7% systems sales growth.","Second, we are pleased to report we have reached our goal of becoming at least 98% franchised, with 856 company units as of the end of 2018. Putting this effort into context, from fourth quarter 2016 through 2018, we transferred over 2,300 units in exchange for $2.8 billion in pretax proceeds with over 160 individual deals to 3C franchisee partners who are excited about our future. These partners are committed to providing consistently bold value and our brand strategies, are capable, able to deliver great customer experience and operational standards and, finally, have capital both to grow new units and modernize existing assets.","Third, we remain on track with our commitment to being more efficient, reducing G&A to 1.7% of systems sales in 2019 and run rate net CapEx of $100 million as I mentioned earlier.","As for our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the three-year period, 2017 through 2019, we remain firmly on track.","During 2018, we repurchased 28 million shares for $2.4 billion at an average price less than $85. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.2 billion through the first two years of this program.","Additionally, we are pleased to have recently announced our quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 for 2019, representing a 17% increase.","While on the subject of capital, we\u2019re very encouraged by the debt market support for our business model and capital structure. Despite broader market volatility during Q4, we successfully issued $1.45 billion in notes through our Taco Bell whole business securitization. As you know, the securitization market is just one of the multiple markets we access.","The transaction was well received and over 2.5 times oversubscribed. It was upsized and reflects some of the tightest spreads ever obtained through a whole business securitization.","Proceeds were used to refinance existing securitization debt and fund a portion of our capital return. ","Now, let\u2019s discuss our growth drivers, beginning with unmatched franchise operating capability. At the KFC division, overall customer satisfaction scores increased by 3% during 2018. We have continued to invest in our franchise know-how by rolling our operations college across the globe to build capability.","The taste of our food is a key differentiator for KFC. Therefore, we are increasing our focus on the role of the cook and enhancing standards around the core.","And lastly, we are continuing to make it easier for our customers to enjoy original recipe through the continued rollout of click and collect kiosks and delivery.","Our goal is to have 5,000 restaurants with kiosks and over 70% of our restaurants offering delivery by 2020.","Just as promising, these enhancements are occurring at the same time our franchisees upgrade and modernize existing assets.","At Pizza Hut US, the team and franchise partners have made improvements in three key areas of the customer experience. First, by delivering a hot fast and reliable pizza. We have improved our average delivery time by three minutes and increased customer satisfaction scores.","Second, since the kickoff of Hut Rewards and updates to our mobile app in late 2017, we have been squarely in the digital game. We have over 12 million active users in the loyalty program and hope to be adding more as our off-line channel gains momentum. It\u2019s an impressive achievement, considering we rolled out the program in the second half of 2017.","Pizza Hut also announced during the fourth quarter that, for the first time ever, Hut Rewards members can earn points for in-store purchases. The brand truly doubled down last year with 2 points awarded for every dollar spent.","At Taco Bell, Julie Masino is doing a fantastic job leading the US division and working with our franchise partners. Their focus on excellent execution is generating operating profit growth, while offering customers faster service and a better experience.","In fact, the speed of service has improved three seconds at lunch and two seconds at dinner, Q4 year-over-year. Unlocking transactions and sales growth during peak service hours, which helped drive over 4 million additional transactions during the quarter.","Their results show that our franchisees have really embraced our initiative of easy and we're excited for what 2019 holds for this cult favorite.","Next, let\u2019s talk about bold restaurant development. During 2018, we opened 3,021 gross restaurants and 1,758 on a net basis, excluding Telepizza, which I will talk about next.","This is truly a step change in pace, representing an approximately 50% increase in net new unit growth from 2016. This is perhaps the clearest example of how focus and a new mindset, which you've consistently heard us discuss, can generate improved results.","There is no single driver of the increase, but rather a holistic approach toward unlocking profitable franchisee-led development, supported by improved unit level economics.","We\u2019re very proud of the teams and franchisees that are making this happen and believe that, by leveraging our scale and expanding our capabilities, we can continue to improve franchisee unit economics, which we all know drives unit growth long-term.","Before we move on to unmatched franchise operating capability, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. This landmark deal places Pizza Hut in the number one position within the category across Latin America and Iberia in terms of unit count, confirming Pizza Hut's position as the world's largest pizza restaurant company.","As the deal closed in December, it had no significant impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. 1,282 Telepizza units are now included in our new master franchise agreement with Telepizza and are included in our overall unit count and have begun paying a fee to Pizza Hut. Of these stores, we anticipate between 100 and 150 may close due to overlap.","Finally, there is an ancillary agreement for another 126 restaurants that are not included in the master franchise agreement.","These non-MFA restaurants will effectively pay a small fee to Pizza Hut, but will not be included in the unit count unless and until they are converted to the Pizza Hut brand. ","Post-closing, our estate transformed to nearly 90% off-premise focused assets within the Telepizza regions. We are excited for what this means for development as Telepizza has agreed to add least 2,500 units to the alliance over the next 20 years.","To summarize, the transformation we started in 2016 is already making Yum! a stronger company, franchisor and investment. We achieved our goal of 98% of restaurants being owned and operated by franchisees and they're on track to deliver our commitments for the transformation.","With three category-leading brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale, expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout 2019.","Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger of UBS.","Dennis Geiger","Great, thanks for the question. David, congratulations on your promotion. Just wondering if you could just spend a bit more time talking about the accelerated unit growth potential for the business going forward?","Another good quarter and good year of growth. Maybe just a bit more on the confidence going forward, which regions may be, to some extent, if you could talk high-level, that comes from \u2013 is it going to look a lot like it did in 2018? And just whether or not there are any other macro challenges and certain parts of the world had any kind of impact on your expectations?","And then, I guess, just the last part of that, obviously, Telepizza just closing now. But just given the experience thus far, just checking in on your appetite to do more acquisition and conversions potentially in the future across brands. Thank you.","David Gibbs","Well, thanks, Dennis. Yeah, I think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story. So, let me give you a little more color on it.","Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4% as that's clearly the most likely outcome that we see. Embedded within that guidance as normal is tailwinds and possible headwinds. ","From a tailwind standpoint, and getting at your question about regions of growth, we are really encouraged by the fact that we're seeing widespread development. If you look back at years passed, a lot of our successful years in development, none of which reached the levels we reached this year, were driven by China. But this year, China has played a much smaller role in us achieving what is a record for Yum! on units. That's because, around the world, we are seeing good unit-level economics, which is driving our franchisees to build more stores. We're spending more time supporting them in this effort and making sure that we\u2019re picking the right locations with more sophisticated market planning tools and being as efficient as possible with our capital spend. So, we've got some great tailwinds and as the development program is becoming more widespread and cuts across really just about every market that we operate in.","As far as possible headwinds for 2019, we have this transition of the Pizza Hut dine-in estate to more of a delivery-focused estate and, obviously, that involves closing and opening stores. And during that churn, we may see more closures perhaps than we anticipated in the short-term at Pizza Hut. So, that's something as a possible headwind that we'll keep our eyes on.","And then, I guess, the other possible headwind, for those of you who listened to the Yum China call, is their guidance for 2019 would imply a deceleration in unit development for them, although their guidance was consistent with their guidance from last year. So, another thing to just keep an eye on is the number of units coming out of Yum China.","And then, I think there's a final point on development. Not considered in the guidance, likely not a big issue, is what I talked about with Telepizza. There's a potential for 100 to 150 units \u2013 that's our best guess right now \u2013 to close between Telepizza and Pizza Hut where there is overlap in a particular trade area.","Obviously, there's going to be a lot more work that needs to be done to dig into that, identify exactly which stores would stay open and how that all plays out. But at the same time, I also highlighted there's 126 units that are not in our unit count today because they're not in the MFA, but our Telepizza stores that have the potential of being added to our unit count.","So, those two things potentially could roughly offset each other. They're not really considered in the guidance. But as we learn more about those stores and the overlaps and the additions, we'll obviously update you on this quarterly call.","As far as your final question on the Telepizza transaction and do we have more of those in the hopper, what I would say is we are really pleased with the Telepizza acquisition. The management of the Telepizza business is first class. We love having them now as our master franchisee in the Yum! world and we think that is a template for more deals that we can do. And we know that all of our brands are out there looking for deals like that. ","So, a lot of people that want to join the Yum! system and we hope to take advantage of that, be selective in adding the right people, but certainly something that we hope to have more news for down the road.","I would just end on the development front by saying there's strong momentum in the business. Our tools for development are getting more and more sophisticated as we can parse data to figure out to where to put stores to be the most profitable, and it's widespread momentum. And as you've seen so far, the surprises tend to be on the upside. So, we're excited about development going into 2019.","Keith Siegner","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Thanks. Good morning. Can you just talk a little bit more about the strength in the Taco Bell business? The QSR industry trends just were not that strong in the third and fourth quarter, but Taco Bell is clearly a standout. Is your breakfast business performing exceptionally well? Is that where you're taking share? Or if you could just maybe describe again in more detail the pockets of strength in the Taco Bell business as you see it?","Greg Creed","Yes. Sure, Brian. I think to reflect on what David said, this is the seventh year of positive same-store sales growth for Taco Bell. So, the success of Taco Bell has been in place for a long time. Obviously, we had an acceleration in the back half of the year. We had 6% same-store sales growth for the back half and, obviously, a 9% system sales growth is a great number to finish the year on.","There's no silver bullet. That team, led by Julie Masino, is just doing a great job across the board. We are known as the value leader. We are known as the innovation leader. As David said, we're running great operations. The assets are in great shape. The franchisees like their restaurant-level margins. And so, I think when you add all that up, you just get a performance \u2013 a consistent performance for the seven years that Taco Bell has delivered and we believe will continue to deliver.","So, the brand is in great shape. Even the delivery advertising which will launch today, I had a chance \u2013 we were at a Taco Bell a couple of weeks ago. I've seen all the marketing around the advertising supporting the Grubhub launch. It's as good as any work I've ever seen come out of Taco Bell. So, if we can accelerate our growth in delivery, I think that's all positive. So, they're just doing everything right led by a great executive team and a great president.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel.","Chris O'Cull","Yes, thank you. My question relates to the Grub partnership. Greg, are there any differences in the consumer experience between Taco Bell because of their partnership with Grubhub compared to maybe other fast food chains that have relationships that aren't as close to their third-party provider? And then, also just wondering why KFC has been a little slower to rollout delivery than Taco Bell and whether you believe it can be as impactful to KFC as Taco Bell?","Greg Creed","It\u2019s like everything. You have to put the foundations in place before you let the, I guess, the horses loose. In this case, getting POS integration in place is really important. And so, obviously, we've spent a lot of time with Taco Bell and Grubhub getting the POS integration done. That's now complete and that's, obviously, why we're launching it. Working on the KFC team to make sure that integrated first.","We don't want to go out and blow out without the integration because we know, with great integration, it improves speed of service, it improves order accuracy, it does everything that the customer wants. And so, you can say we've got a little slow. I would say we've gone a little slow early in order to accelerate going forward.","So, I'm very excited about the launch day for Taco Bell. I'm very excited that more KFC restaurants will come onboard before the end of 2019. And all indications are, certainly in the early days, higher check, incremental transactions, all of that bodes well for both brands in the US.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles of Cowen and Company.","Andrew Charles","Thank you. And, David, congrats on a well-deserved promotion. I know you've talked about Telepizza's neutral impact expected to 2019 EPS, but can you walk us through the mechanics of this? Presumably the system sales will grow with roughly, as you finalize at 1,100, 1,200 new stores, is the expectation that this will be offset by a pronounced deterioration in the effective Pizza royalty rate or, separately, can we expect elevated franchise and license expenses or elevated G&A to lead to the EPS neutral impact?","David Gibbs","The impact on profitability being neutral is really from the fact that we are contributing into this alliance some of our Pizza Hut's franchise stores today and, therefore, we're reducing the royalty we collect from those stores. So, we get less royalty from the stores we're contributing, we get the royalty from the stores that Telepizza is contributing, and effectively, from a rounding standpoint, it's neutral. We do think, long-term, it will be accretive because we think it will accelerate the rate of our growth. And to your question about G&A, obviously, most master franchise agreements, the master franchisor, in this case Telepizza, actually carries the G&A to manage the business. That's why we take a lower royalty. So, we don't expect any increase in our G&A. In fact, it would be the opposite. Our G&A over time will go down covering those areas as Telepizza gets up to speed on the business.","Keith Siegner","Thanks. Operator, we have time for one question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort of Bank of America.","Gregory Francfort","Thank you. And just, David, can you talk about \u2013 as you've taken on the new responsibilities \u2013 what your key priorities will be and where you see the biggest opportunities for the business?","David Gibbs","Yeah. As I shift to more of this President and Chief Operating Officer role, my priorities are the business priorities. We've transformed this business to being more a franchise business. Obviously, franchise unit economics are at the center of everything we do and I want to make sure that we're transitioning the way we approach the business, and we are seeing evidence of this everywhere we go, so it's not a concern. But I want to make sure we complete this journey to being a world-class franchisor, putting our franchisees, their unit economics, front and center at everything we do. So, I'll be spending a lot of time in the field with our field teams and with our franchise partners as I get up to speed in the new role in 2019 doing just that.","I think the business is in great shape, obviously. I don't have an agenda for massive change. We are on the right path. And I think Greg and I and the entire Yum! and brand leadership teams are really excited about putting a bow on a good 2018 and moving into 2019 with some momentum.","I'll turn it over to Greg now for just a few closing comments.","Greg Creed","Thanks, David. So, first of all, I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. We are proud of what our teams and our franchisees accomplished in 2018.","Combined, we opened up more than 300 more organic restaurants in 2018 than we did in 2017. We closed [indiscernible] transformative deals that should drive profitable system sales growth for our franchisees, Grubhub, Telepizza, QuikOrder.","We made material progress on all of our 2016 transformation goals, including, as we have said, completing our refranchising program.","I'm pleased to add that we closed out 2018 on a high note with Q4 being the best quarter of the year in terms of same-store sales growth, system sales growth, and core operating profit.","So, heading into 2019, we remain confident we are going to deliver on becoming a more focused, more franchised, and more efficient, all of which will deliver more growth and further strengthen our powerful and unique business model. Thanks for joining us on the call today.","David Gibbs","Thank you, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
