(Operator Instructions).","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor to Francesca Luthi, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.  You may begin.","Francesca Luthi","","Thank you, Kevin.  Good morning, everyone.  We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results with you today.  Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Rob Pollack, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Peninger, our Chief Financial Officer, and Chris Pagano, our Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer.  ","Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results.  Both the release and corresponding financial supplement are available at Assurant.com.  ","All prior period financial information presented in the release in the financial supplement and on this call reflects the new accounting guidelines for deferred acquisition costs, which the company adopted as of January 1st, 2012.  ","We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Rob and Mike with Chris participating in the Q&A session.  ","Some of the statements we made on today's call may be forward-looking.  And actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements.  Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports including our 2011 form 10-K, third quarter 2012 form 10-Q, and upcoming 2012 form 10-K.  Each is filed with the SEC.  ","Today's call will also contain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company's performance.  For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at Assurant.com.  ","Now I will turn the call over to Rob.","Rob Pollock","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning everyone.  ","In 2012, we accelerated growth in the specialty areas we are targeting for expansion.  And align resources to best support these opportunities for the future.  We also prudently managed our capital.  Our strong balance sheet continues to provide great flexibility.  We did this in a year when our results were significantly affected by Super Storm Sandy.  As we start the new year, we are well-positioned to grow profitably.  ","I'll highlight our three key metrics, discuss capital flows, and offer some comments on our progress at each business.  Then Mike will talk about specific results for each of our segments.  ","Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI was 10.4% for the year.  This includes $163 million of after-tax catastrophe losses.  ","Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI increased by 13.8% for the year reflecting a combination of our earnings and re-purchase activity.","And revenue defined as net earned premium and fee income increased by 2.4% in 2012 driven by strong contributions from specialty property and solutions.  ","Turning to capital management, we secured $580 million in dividends from our operating companies.  This was about $40 million more than the operating income from our businesses in 2012.  We returned $472 million to shareholders through stock repurchases and common dividends.  Since our ITO in 2004, we've increased our dividend every year.","During the fourth quarter, we did not implement a new share repurchase program because of Sandy.  It was the largest flood event our business has experienced.  By the time we were able to report an estimate of total losses, we had entered our earnings blackout period.  Despite this interruption, we did buy almost $11 million shares in 2012 representing about 12% of our shares outstanding at the end of 2011.  We continue to view our stock as attractively priced and repurchases as a prudent use of capital.  ","Now I'll turn to the businesses.  Assurant Solutions expanded in several targeted areas.  In 2012, our net earned premiums from service contracts increased by over $120 million.  Our domestic vehicle service contract business was a primary driver as we continue to benefit from the rebound in auto sales that started in mid-2009.  ","We further strengthened our position in Latin America, a key market for Solutions.  In the fourth quarter, we signed a ten year agreement for service contracts with Novo Mundo, one of the largest retailers in Brazil with more than 180 stores.  ","At the same time, we continued the phased rollout of our Telef\u00f3nica partnership and are now servicing their mobile customers across five countries in Latin America.  ","In addition, we recently expanded our relationship with Sprint by launching a mobile device protection program for Sprint's wholesale network partners.  ","Solutions sales pipeline is robust.  And the business is very focused on achieving its' 14% ROE goal in 2014.  ","At Assurant Specialty Property, we made tremendous strides in 2012.  The investments we've made to better serve homeowners and clients from loan tracking all the way through claims adjudication were evident in our response to Sandy.  Our employees quickly brought relief to our policyholders impacted by the storm.  The swift deployment of our frontline team insured that claims were processed and paid quickly. ","Focusing on customer service and supporting our clients helped us further expand our lender placed business in 2012.  Despite a shrinking overall mortgage loan inventory, we were able to increase the loans we track nearly 3 million to over 31 million loans in total.  We're well-positioned to gain more as portfolios move between servicers in the months ahead.  ","Our multi-family housing business, another target area, achieved double-digit revenue growth in 2012.  Our resident bond products, which complement our renter's insurance offerings helped us cross-sell our products to existing clients and in turn to their residence.  We'll well-positioned to capitalize on the trend of renting versus owing in the U.S. housing market.  ","We're also pleased with our progress at Assurant Health.  Despite a challenging fourth quarter, we grew sales for the third consecutive quarter.  We completed the rollout of our network agreement with Aetna with a more competitive products sweep and a broader choice of network providers, we've experienced double-digit sales increases in many key Aetna markets.  And we saw a pickup in small group sales that we believe reflect our improved competitive position.  Those increases combined with the continued success of our affordable choice and supplement products helped us grow the total number of insured lives by about 6% in 2012.  ","We will evolve our strategy as new rules related to new rules related to healthcare reform unfold.  Currently for example, we're evaluating our options and fine-tuning our strategy related to healthcare exchanges.  While preliminary regulations were issued in November, many open questions remain related to timing and availability.  As we adapt, we remain confident that our long history in the individual healthcare market and deep customer insights uniquely position us to succeed.  ","Finally, we were pleased by our strong results at Assurant's Employee Benefits.  Several years ago, Benefits strategically focused on voluntary and the shift of small business benefit plans from employer funded to employee paid offerings.  We responded by diversifying our product sweep, enhancing our distribution, and rolling out easier to use enrollment and administrative platforms.  ","In addition, we strengthened our dental network in 2012 with our United Concordia arrangement.  We now offer the largest dental PPO network in many markets.  The success of this approach is evident in our 2012 results.  Voluntary drove about half of benefit sales and over a third of its premiums.  ","While the economy still presents challenges for small businesses, we believe that our voluntary products and capabilities have us well positioned for success.  Overall, we're pleased with our progress in 2012.  We see many opportunities to focus on market segments where we can compete differently.  Examples include mobile, multi-family housing, voluntary benefits, and affordable healthcare.  Achieving steady improvements across all of our businesses is our focus in 2013.  ","And with that, I'll turn to Mike for more detailed comments on the fourth quarter and the outlook for this year.","Mike Peninger","","Thanks, Rob.  ","I'll start with Solutions where net operating income for the quarter reflected $28.1 million of previously disclosed charges for U.K. intangible impairments and workforce reduction primarily in our domestic credit and European operations.  Absent these items and a non-recurring tax benefit of $3.5 million, net operating income declined in the quarter as weaker domestic results offset continued growth and favorable experience in Latin America.  ","Several factors contributed to the decline in the U.S.  The previously disclosed loss of a mobile client effective last October reduced net earned premiums by about $22 million in the quarter.  ","Second, we incurred expenses of approximately $5 million in our mobile and vehicle services businesses to enhance our technology platform and support new business growth. ","And finally, we saw less favorable underwriting experience in our service contract business.  ","These factors increased our domestic combined ratio excluding disclosed items to 98.7% for the full year, above our long-term target of 98%.  While quarterly experience can fluctuate, we expect the combined ratio to return to the target level in 2013.  ","In 2012, we saw improved performance in our international operations led by Latin America.  Absent disclosed items, European underwriting results also were better.  Canadian results remained strong.  And we made additional progress in China.  ","Overall, Solutions international combined ratio excluding the disclosed items was 102.4% for the year, a 160 basis point year-over-year improvement.  In 2013, we expect an additional 100 to 200 basis point reduction primarily from profitable growth in Latin America and additional expense initiatives in Europe.  ","Our pre-need business remains an important contributor to Solutions' overall results.  Fee income increased more than 30%.  And sales were up by 14% for the year.  These results reaffirm our strong relationship with SCI and the value of its broad funeral home network. ","Across Solutions, we expect modest increases in both net earned premiums and earnings excluding disclosed items in 2013.  This will be driven by a combination of profitable growth and expense management initiatives.  ","Looking ahead to 2014, Solutions continues to target a 14% ROE.  Achieving this goal will require further progress in international especially in Europe.  Improved results in the U.K. during 2013 is a critical step.  In the fourth quarter, our U.K. operating loss was about $4 million excluding disclosed items.  Based on the actions we've taken, we expect lower losses in the first half of the year followed by a small profit in the second half of 2013.  We believe we are on track to deliver on this commitment for the U.K. and to continue to improve our overall European results.  ","Fourth quarter earnings in specialty property were depressed by Sandy.  Excluding the impact of the storm, results were strong.  Revenue increased by 13% as our loan portfolio continued to grow.  Fourth quarter and full year results also benefitted from better non-catastrophe loss experience, which is consistent with reported industry results.  ","The growth in written premiums was driven by previously disclosed loan portfolio addition and approximately 650,000 of loans newly added in the fourth quarter.  Prior coverage on about 200,000 of these loans was flat cancelled, so they began producing premiums in the fourth quarter.  ","An existing client acquired 300,000 more loans this January, which will increase premiums in the first half of this year as prior coverage will also be flat cancelled.  ","As a result of the loan activity late last year, our placement rate in the fourth quarter increased by 2.87%.  While this is very high by historical standards, it's important to note that absent the impact of the new loan portfolios, the rate would have remained consistent with the third quarter.  We expect placement rates in the near term to fluctuate reflecting the state of the housing market and the changing composition of our track loan portfolio.  Over time, we continue to expect placement rates to decline.  ","As a percentage of our portfolio exposed to hurricanes grows, we continue to manage risk prudently.  In January, we replaced about 60% of our total 2013 re-insurance program at rates comparable to last year's program.  We'll provide an update on the completed program in June.  ","The impact of our next generation product continues.  Feedback from clients is positive in the 14 states where it's already available.  And by the end of the second quarter, we expect to implement it in 14 more states.  And we'll continue the rollout to other states through the end of this year.  ","On the regulatory front, our discussion with the New York Department of Financial Services continue.  But we do not have new information to share at this time.  ","In Florida, we've had discussions with the Office of Insurance to introduce the features of our new next generation product.  And now expect to file in the first quarter.  ","On the federal front, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published its mortgage servicing guidelines in January.  These were in line with Dodd Frank and largely consistent with our current practices.  ","There's been speculation about potential new arrangements for Fanny Mae, but no changes have been announced.  We continue to believe that an addition to our new product, we have the capabilities, expertise, and infrastructure to offer solutions to the government's sponsored entities as they work to control the costs of their programs.  We'll provide you an updated view of the business once these regulatory matters are resolved.  In the meantime, we continue to believe that returns for the business will be attractive, albeit lower in the future.  ","For 2013, we expect specialty properties revenue to increase slightly from 2012 due to growth in our lender placed portfolio and multi-family housing.  Our overall results will continue to be influenced by placement rate trends, premium rate changes, loan portfolio activity, client renewals, and catastrophe losses.  We expect our expense ratio to remain approximately level with 2012 as we continue to improve efficiency while further improving client and customer service.  ","At health, changes in the minimum loss ratio rebate liability significantly affected fourth quarter net operating income.  Due to favorable loss experience on certain blocks of business, we increased our MLR rebate accrual in the fourth quarter.  The accrual reduced our net operating income by $9.7 million after tax.  In contrast, we made a refinement to the MLR calculation that increased net operating income by about $4.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.  ","Several other factors contributed to the drop in net operating income for the quarter.  Net earned premiums declined reflecting the continued shift to lower premium products in our individual business and fewer small group insured lives.  ","Also, as we have priced business with the MLR targets in mind, loss ratios are beginning to move up.  Throughout 2012, health continued to tightly manage expenses and reduce its' capital.  General expenses excluding commissions declined by 11% in 2012.  Due to the low capital intensity of the business, health also was able to contribute approximately $160 million of dividends to corporate in 2012.  ","In 2013, our loss ratio should continue to trend up toward MLR targets.  Our effective tax rate will remain elevated due to limitations imposed by healthcare reform on the deductibility of compensation and certain other payments.  We'll continue to look for opportunities to further reduce our cost structure to offset these pressures.  But the rate of reductions will be slower than in the past.     ","Recent sales momentum is encouraging.  And we expect to continue to increase in the total number of insured lives in 2013, although the market remains very dynamic.  ","Taking all these factors into account along with the absence of the substantial 2012 real estate investment income, we expect a decline in health's earnings in 2013.  Nevertheless, we remain optimistic that our relentless focus on creating affordable solutions for our consumers will allow us to take advantage of the potentially large market opportunity created by healthcare reform.  ","Employee benefits posted strong results for the fourth quarter.  Net operating income increased 18% over the same period in 2011 due to favorable results across major product lines.  Dental experience was especially strong.  And disability incidents and recovery rates remained relatively stable throughout the year.  ","Our results also demonstrated growing momentum in the voluntary benefit space.  In order to provide greater insight into our progress, we are now showing voluntary net earned premiums and sales in our financial supplement.  ","Continuing in our efforts to focus resources, we sold a small subsidiary of benefits that provides disability advocacy services during the fourth quarter.  This sale will reduce both fee income and expenses by approximately $8 million per year.  But will not impact net operating income.  ","Overall, we expect 2013 revenues at benefits to be roughly level with 2012 as the continued strength of our voluntary offerings are tempered by limited growth prospects for traditional employer paid coverage.  ","We plan to lower our reserve discount rate for new long-term disability claims incurred in 2013 by 50 basis points to 4.25%.  This will have about a $4 million bottom-line impact.  The new discount rate combined with lower investment income will lead to a reduction in segment profitability in 2013.  To partially offset these pressures, benefits continues to closely manage its' expenses and capital.  ","Moving to corporate matters, our capital position is strong.  We ended the quarter with approximately $530 million in deployable capital in addition of our $250 million buffer.  As Rob noted, following Sandy, we did not repurchase additional shares in the fourth quarter.  Going forward, our capital deployment strategy remains the same.  We expect to balance returning capital to shareholders with ongoing investments, both to support organic growth and in acquisitions.  ","For 2013, we anticipate operating and company dividends to approximately equal operating earnings.  As always, dividends will be a function of growth in the business, rating agency or regulatory requirements, and investment performance. ","Despite low interest rates, our investment portfolio continued to perform well.  Our conservative management and low asset turnover helped moderate the pace of the yield decline in our portfolio.  However, yields will continue to decline absent changes in the macro environment.  ","Overall, we are pleased with our 2012 results and progress in creating long-term value for our shareholders.  ","And with that, we'll ask the operator to open the call for question.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  ","The floor is now open for questions. (Operator instructions).  Thank you, and our first question will come from line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Rob Pollock \u2013 President & CEO","","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Good morning. I guess first question in terms of the outlook for top line at property. I mean, you note slight increase, but you talk about a few potential factors around placement rates, premium rates. I\u2019m curious if you factor in \u2013 or what changes you factor in related to those with the slight uptick for top line growth?","Rob Pollock \u2013 President & CEO","","Yes. So, I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll let Mike add some collar.  Obviously the movement in loan portfolios is driving our top line growth, Chris.  And, you know, as Mike pointed out we already know we\u2019ve got another portfolio coming in in the first quarter. I\u2019ll let Mike talk about the mechanics of how different portfolios can come in, but this is driving things, I think it fits in very well with our strategy of being aligned with market leaders. And, you know, we think we\u2019re well positioned as portfolios continue to move around.","So, you know, despite that overall inventory of mortgage loans being down, we are growing. Mike, do you want to\u2026","Mike Peninger \u2013 CFO","","Yes. I\u2019ll just add a couple things. I mean, we\u2019ve announced several loan portfolio additions over the course of 2012, and then the ones that come in \u2013 that I mentioned coming in this quarter, you know, when you get the flat cancel business that, you know, sort of immediately comes on to your books and drives up written premiums in a particular quarter.  ","Other portfolios, and we had some, I think earlier in 2012 we had 1 million loan portfolios, and another 2 million, and those are coming at renewal.  So, those gradually build up over time.  So, we try to factor all those things going on, and then make reasonable assumptions about the other factors that drive the growth.","Rob Pollock \u2013 President & CEO","And there\u2019s just a great, as you know, variability depending on the portfolio, because some of the ones Mike mentioned had a placement rate of about 1% obviously, you know, higher quality loan portfolios. Placement rate of some of the others are quite a bit higher.","Mike Peninger \u2013 CFO","And I\u2019ll just reiterate, the growth in our placement rate was, as Rob said, driven by the changing composition.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Understood.  And then does \u2013 the premium rate changes, does it contemplate anything beyond what we know from California?","Rob Pollock \u2013 President & CEO"," ","Not specifically. You know, as I said we would certainly if we, you know, get future things that would meaningfully impact our forecast, we\u2019ll give you an update. But I certainly reflect the new product we\u2019ve rolled out that Mike mentioned, and you know, that \u2013 we\u2019ve certainly made assumptions on what might happen there related to servicers making decisions around deductibles, or coverage amounts, Chris.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then I guess you\u2019ve obviously been very successful getting cost out of the business. So, I guess I\u2019m surprised that you kind of continue to see expense management opportunities in most of the segments in 2013.","So, I wanted to see if you could maybe give us an update of the run-rate cost reductions that you\u2019ve taken out of the business to date, and what the incremental opportunity, you know, could be here as we move forward?","Mike Peninger \u2013 CFO","I\u2019ll start, and maybe Rob can [inaudible] if he wants. I think, sort of a business-by-business story, Chris, and we\u2019re constantly working that.  And you know, at [inaudible] for example, probably a notable example, where we\u2019ve been working at it for a couple of years. We\u2019ve got some of the easier things, and then as you farther, you get into a more complicated changes like simplifying the systems environment et cetera. ","In property, you know, they\u2019ve had cost driven by the substantial growth that they\u2019ve had to, you know, add staff to handle that and maintain the customer service levels. So, now you know, they\u2019re working, their still getting that kind of growth and you know this helps some dampen the impact of that.  They\u2019re also investing in their systems and looking for opportunities to become more efficient.","And then in Solutions, you know, I think there they took some actions in the fourth quarter. They continue to look for opportunities to streamline their business too. But I think you really have to look at the expense story as an over \u2013 a business- by-business on.","Rob Pollock \u2013 President & CEO","I think that\u2019s right. And, you know, I guess what I\u2019d add is, that movement of resources to the important areas and away from things that, you know, for instance that Domestic Credit Business.  We know that business is going away, we took a lot of expenses out in the fourth quarter, okay.  And, you know, we want to make sure we\u2019re putting our resources on the best opportunities.","Mike Peninger \u2013 CFO","Yes, and I think \u2013 I guess another couple of examples there is in benefits for example, where they\u2019ve essentially taken resources out of that traditional employer paid business, and moved them into the voluntary business. In Solutions, you know, I commented on some of the expenses we incurred in the quarter to build out our technology platform, and (NYSE:VFC) and in Mobile. And so we\u2019re trying to fund some of those things by, as Rob said, redeploying resources from other areas in the company too.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and then last one; I guess last quarter and some prior quarters, you\u2019ve given some insight into share repurchases through the first few weeks of the given quarter.  Wondering if you could give us an update for 1Q to date?","Rob Pollock \u2013 President & CEO","Sure, let me just start and I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris who can provide all the details. But, one of the big things is, you know, we mentioned we didn\u2019t implement a new repurchase program, because we were blacked out, Chris.  And, you know, that blackout will remain in effect through next \u2013 sometimes next week I guess, just because of the earnings blackout.","I think more important, is to think about, you know, if you sit and look at our business, our businesses generate a lot of free cash flow, and I think we have a history of prudent capital management.  And I\u2019m going to let Chris talk a little bit about, you know, just how all that comes together.","Chris Pagano \u2013 Chief Investment Officer & Treasurer","","I think, and again, the fourth quarter situation notwithstanding, there\u2019s \u2013 absolutely nothing\u2019s changed with our respect to capital management.  We continue to execute on our priorities, capitalizing the existing businesses, looking to deploy capital in profitable growth opportunities either organically or through acquisition.  And then, return capital to shareholders there through dividends of share repurchase.","We continue to believe the shares are undervalued, and that share purchase is a prudent use of deployable capital.  And as we begin 2013, we feel very good about our ability to execute on those priorities, $530 million of deployable capital. As Mike mentioned, early estimates are that we\u2019ll be able to dividend operating earnings up to the holding company throughout the course of the year. ","And also the ability if we need to on an opportunistic basis access the debt markets in something in the $300 to $400 million if that presented itself.  So, we feel very good about our flexibility, but again, most importantly long-term nothing\u2019s changed about capital \u2013 our view on capital management and its role in creating long-term shareholder value.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","","Our next comes from the site of Jimmy (inaudible)","Jimmy [Inaudible]","","[Inaudible] questions. First one on just the weak performance in the extended service contract business in the U.S.  Can you give us some details on the causes of the weakness, whether it\u2019s concentrated at the one product, or a specific distributor, and the chances of it continuing?","And then secondly on capital deployment; do you expect any other users for capital deployment other than the share buybacks?  And if you are looking at deals, what type of hurdles they\u2019ve have to meet?  Given your stock prices, I\u2019d assume that deals would be unlikely, but maybe you could talk about that as well.","Rob Pollock \u2013 President & CEO","Sure. You know, just in a general, and then I\u2019ll let both Mike and Chris comment.  You know, we will have variability and results from quarter to quarter on the service contract business.  We still expect to be at that 98% combined ratio next year. So, I wouldn\u2019t, you know, there\u2019s nothing there that we see as anything particularly problematic.","Mike Peninger \u2013 CFO","","Yes, I\u2019d agree with that. You know, we look at our experience sort of client-by-client in the service contract. And, you know, we had a handful of clients that had, as Rob said; we saw some ticks-up in their loss ratio. ","But, part of managing this business is to, you know, look at the loss experience as it emerges, and you know, have regular dialogue with the clients, and implement corrective actions when we see things going off track. So, that\u2019s sort of the process we\u2019re going through now.","Rob Pollock \u2013 President & CEO","And then on the capital deployment front, you know, I think Chris summarized well that, you know, there\u2019s no difference in how we\u2019re looking at things, but I\u2019ll let him expand on how we view our capital and deploy it.","Chris Pagano \u2013 Chief Investment Officer & Treasurer","","Yes, I think the key to capital deployment and the various uses of our deployable capital is discipline. And we have certain targeted growth areas in each of the segments where we look to \u2013 are looking at opportunities on a regular basis.  We have specific hurdle rates by business, depending on the risk profile of the opportunity.","And then, again, when the opportunities are not there, we are willing and have demonstrated the ability to, and the willingness to return capital to shareholders.  We\u2019ve, you know, returned about 1.5 billion over the last three years in the form or share repurchase, another 200 million of dividends. ","So, again, I think that\u2019s an indication of our discipline here.  We look at a lot of deals. The pipeline is active. We are regularly sourcing, having conversations about growth opportunities, regularly sourcing, having conversations about growth opportunities, but absent those opportunities meeting our financial requirements, we are going to return the capital to shareholders.","Jimmy [Inaudible]"," ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to the site of John Nadel, with Sterne Agee.  Your line is open.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach"," ","Good morning, everybody.  Rob, I want to start with, perhaps, maybe more of a strategic question for you around the lender place business.  If I look at your full year results in specialty property, it is clearly driven by the force place business; it was a very strong year, even reflecting the higher catastrophe losses as your ROE was about 27%.  So my question is this, given all of the various state and regulatory pressures, the focus around this business, have you considered trying to preempt some of these pressures by submitting proactively for premium rate reductions in conjunction with your next-generation product filings?","Why not, instead of reacting, getting out in front of this issue and show folks if it is Fannie or if it is others, that you recognize that the returns are probably unsustainably too high and you are willing to bring them down without someone forcing your hand?","Rob Pollock","Yep, okay.  I think, first, John, rating is a state-by-state process, and it is based on A, our experience and what we expect is going to be an indication of experience moving forward.  So I think that is quite important.  Second, as Mike mentioned, we know that our risk profile is increasing.  We just looked at our storm activity this year where we are going to have severe, but infrequent events and we have got to make sure that our premiums reflect that.  That being said, our next-generation product provides a lot of flexibility to allow premium rates to be lower and that can come from a majority of different factors.  Again, I go back to the other comment Mike made, we  understand that returns will be attractive in the business but they are going to be lower, which I think is a reflection of the issue that you have raised that we are trying to be responsive to.  ","So, saying all of that, we have the capability and expertise that are winning business in a market that overall, probably is declining.  So I think that is just indicative of the model that we have.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Yeah, no question.  Obviously, you have some great relationships out there - [inaudible] and others so, that makes a lot of sense.  Then, I guess related to that, Rob, have you guys specifically been at the table with Fannie Mae or Freddie or the FHFA, I think it is?  Can you give us any color on the discussions, if at all?","Rob Pollock","Remember, John, we talk to these guys all of the time, okay because they are looking at how the programs work, we have capabilities.  There are a lot of technical points around how these programs work.  We have been in, we have talked to them and we talk to them regularly.  We think we have that new program that we have talked about, our next-generation product - that can respond to many, many of the issues being raised in the market.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Rob, does that next-generation product, where there is a lot more flexibility to get the premium levels down, is that premium level down because deductibles might be higher, or is that premium level is down because the actual rate on line is down?","Rob Pollock","Well, first, the first is obviously the case that if they choose to have deductibles higher, things can change; they can change coverage amount.  But remember in that next-generation product, we are introducing some more sophistication, so there is different geographic ratings.  What that would imply is that there are some geographic areas things may go up a little, but others they are going to go down; it is all dependant on the particulars, John.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, and then separately, one quick one on the health side.  I recognize that the visibility remains cloudy around this business, but your outlook indicates we should expect that earnings are down in '13 versus '12, when we adjust 2012 for those real estate gains, so can you just clarify for us what the baseline 2012 earnings number is, and can you give us any help around order of magnitude decline?","Rob Pollock","I will let Mike talk a little, but I want to go back to when Healthcare Reform was enacted, we changed our strategy, and what did we tell people?  We said that fundamentally, we have a strategy, we think the strategy is a winning strategy that can deliver returns that will be attractive to shareholders when healthcare is fully implemented.  Why?  Because we believe this is a specialty business in the individual side of things, will continue to be and that we have unique skills that we can bring to the table.","Remember, as Healthcare Reform is implemented, there are different changes along the way that are going to cause bumpiness in the results.  Mike, do you want to just comment on this?","","Mike Peninger","Yeah.  I think, John, obviously you take off the real estate income that we talked about in the fourth quarter.  Quarter over quarter you had the mechanics of the MLR causing some noise, so if you looked at the full year, we probably - it does not spread evenly.  Part of the reason, again, one of the challenges in forecasting this, is that our rebate liability is made up of a lot of separate calculations - we have talked about that before.  You have credibility of experience that is always informing your calculations, too, so that can introduce a certain amount of volatility.  We had an excellent year in 2012, too.  Experience, generally, was pretty good.  As we move forward, you have got credibility changes in the formulas that are going to impact our results, you have got upcoming changes around guarantee issue that go in at the beginning of 2014, and as we price for the MLR targets, that is going to drive our lost ratios up, too, so you have got a lot of different things going on.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Just to be more clear, what is the 2012 baseline we should be thinking about, Mike?","Mike Peninger","Obviously, so many moving parts, but about 25, about 35 million.  I am just not sure.","Rob Pollock","It is primarily taking out the real estate income, John.  That would be the main one.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","One more quick one, I am sorry.  The 300,000 loans that are coming on in 1Q, can you give us a sense on the placement rate on that, since it is a flat cancel?","Rob Pollock","I believe that will be a placement rate that is relatively high.","Mike Peninger","Higher than the block.","Rob Pollock","Yeah, I think that one is going to be a little bit higher.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Higher than what?  I am sorry.","Mike Peninger","Than the block, in general.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Got it.","Rob Pollock","One last one that I would add on healthcare that Mike has mentioned in the past, is that the provisions - and Mike talked about this  around non-deductibility of expenses, John, will be another contributor to healthcare results being challenged next year.","Mike Peninger","That will show up in the tax rate for the segment.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay.  Very helpful.  Thank you for all of the answers.","Operator","Well go next to the site of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.  Your line is open.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners"," ","Thank you.","Rob Pollock","Morning, Mark.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Morning. ","Actually, I want to go back to one of John's questions.  I guess, maybe one health, is it possible to give us a dollar value of the impact to health, from purely the phase in the credibility feature changes that will go between '12 and '13?","Rob Pollock","Off the top of my head, no, but again it is something we could look at.  It is very complicated.  Mike mentioned these 400 different calculations, and just in the fourth quarter, you get things moving over and under that target medical loss ratio, it can suddenly have you putting up a rebate that you had not anticipated.","Mike Peninger","One of our challenges is that we have business spread over the whole country, so when you are doing these separate rebate calculations, you do not have total credible experience in very many of those cells, so as experience builds and becomes more credible, then you can sort of factor that into your MLR calculation, but whether that experience is good or bad will determine the amount of the adjustment.  So, there is just a lot of complexity under the covers, here.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Okay.  On solutions and the 14% ROE target in '14, which you still expect to achieve, my question is, does something more dramatic have to happen as you get later to '13 or into '14 on either the combined ratio improvement side or on the capital allocation?  I am just trying to think about how you get there.","Rob Pollock","Yep.  First, I just go back and look at the progress we have made over the last several years, which the overall ROE has improved within solutions, and we think that we have outlined a pathway to get there.  So, we have that combination of the growth, we have embedded business on the books that will earn out, that we think we have aligned the site on the profitability, so that will be one.  You are going to see us continue to manage expenses; that would be a second way we will get there.  Third, we are always looking for capital efficiency, and will continue to try to do that.  So, I think it is going to be all of these factors and combination helping us get there.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Okay.  Maybe just on the expense side, obviously you are cutting expenses in health, pretty dramatically - you are cutting expenses in solutions - I guess the expectation for corporate is actually a bigger loss, rather than what you have been experiencing, and I am just kind of curious if you could just walk through the activities that are happening at the corporate segment that is driving a higher cost load, visa vie, cutting expenses everywhere else.  What are the investments in the activities that are occurring there that we should be thinking about?","Rob Pollock","First, I think if you look at the numbers that we have put out, I think the corporate level expenses are rather flat, year over year, maybe up a couple million.  Obviously, there is a number of things related to just being a public company, but in addition to that, we trying to fund some small incubation and growth initiatives, such as solar etc. that we might bring out to others.","I think that is really the driver in any increase, Mark, is really those investments to help fund the growth.  We are trying to look at some different opportunities - solar is one example that we have talked a little a bit about, but we are seating a certain amount of experiments around the company and each of the businesses to try to look for more opportunities in the market, and we think that is a prudent use of a relatively modest amount of capital to help keep fuel for future growth.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Okay.  Maybe just one more, if I may.  On specialty property outlook, you kind of suggested that expense is relatively flat, or expense ration - I cannot recall exactly what you said - but is there any guidance or feel that we should get in terms of the average rate assumed in that guidance number between '12 and '13?","Rob Pollock","That is kind of what we talked about in the prior question, Mark.  The rate assumptions in the guidance are sort of state by state, reflecting experience, and then also combined with expected growth in the loan portfolio, but no overall average - down five, down seven, down three, no overall, overriding kind of outlook.","Rob Pollock ","","No, it\u2019s going to be a function of where the policies show up. ","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Okay.  All right, thank you. ","Rob Pollock","","Mm-hmm. ","Operator","","We\u2019ll go next to the site of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.  Your line is open. ","","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research Equities","Thank you, and good morning.  To follow up on John\u2019s question about your discussions with Fannie Mae, there have been press reports about a consortium.  If there was a consortium with the attributes that have been talked about in the press, would that be something that you would want to join or would be able to join?  ","Rob Pollock ","","Well, you know, first we don\u2019t speculate, but you know, again, I think our next-generation product addresses a multitude of uses that can help any of the GSEs get lower premiums if that\u2019s their choice.  And the flexibility around that and being able to \u2013 remember, the servicers are our client.  We can provide the servicer with infinite flexibility on how they deal with that portfolio of theirs that can produce lower premiums on GSE loans, depending on the particulars.  ","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research Equities","Okay.  Thank you.  And as a follow up, last year you had given kind of a steady state estimate of placement rates and as the  housing market improves, you know, I think the mortgage insurers have seen new notices of default come down 25, 30% year over year.  I\u2019m just wondering where you think that steady state placement rate will shake out because I think you said overtime you do expect it to decrease. ","Rob Pollock","","Well, that\u2019s right.  We do expect it to go down and, you know, I think what we looked at overtime was returning to levels we\u2019ve seen in the \u201806\/\u201907 timeframe.  Now, again, that was our best thinking at the time.  We also know, however, it\u2019s going to fluctuate, you can see that in the portfolios we\u2019ve brought on the books.  ","I think another important trend that we\u2019ve tried to outline is, you know, we also think that placement rate is being impacted as voluntary carriers are leaving the more cat-prone areas.  So we don\u2019t have a full clear line of sight on that yet, but we\u2019re working on it and we know that, you know, our placement, as Mike mentioned, is going up in the more cat-prone areas.  ","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research Equities","Thank you.  ","Rob Pollock","","Next question. ","Operator","","We\u2019ll go next to the site of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James and Associates.  Your line is open.  ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates","Hey. ","Rob Pollock ","","Good morning, Steven. ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates","Hey, good morning.  I want to return to health if I may with two questions.  The rebate, remind us, this is a catch-up for what periods, for what quarters? ","Rob Pollock ","","The rebate is accrued for 2012 experience, so at the end of the year, we\u2019re holding, you know, how much of the \u2013 the premium we earned in 2012 that we\u2019ll have to rebate.  ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates","Okay.  With that, looking at Assurant Health, the loss ratio for the full year was around 74%.  I guess my question is, I know there\u2019s going to be some difference between the GAAP MLR and your regulatory MLR, but I guess my question is once you get full credibility, maybe this is another way of asking John\u2019s question, but once you get the full credibility, where would that be if you had, you know, the full 80 \u2013 the full 80 MLR on a regulatory basis? ","Rob Pollock ","","Yeah, I think we\u2019ve talked about that being in the, you know, medium 70s or 75, 76, somewhere in that range and that\u2019s a function, you know, of we have business that, you know, subject to the MLR guidelines, we have our Affordable Care products and you know, some business that\u2019s not so it\u2019s sort of a blended.  But you know, I think you\u2019re going to see us move up into that, you know, 75, 76, 77 kind of range would be probably equating to the 80% MLR target. ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates","","Okay.  And then, I didn\u2019t realize that was the ultimate.  I thought that was for this year.  And then if I may, the \u2013 you\u2019re affordable choice product, is that MLR exempt? ","Rob Pollock ","","By and large, yes.  I think it is, yep.  Again, you know, the \u2013 if you look at when we set the strategy up, we talked about the PPACA products, which are subject to the MLR and ones that aren\u2019t.  We started from a very small base of the other products.  We\u2019ve had nice growth there, but still a small percentage of our overall block.  That business is not subject to the MLR and I think that points out what Mike said.  I think when he talked about that, you know, 75 to 77, that\u2019s on the Affordable Care Act product that are subject to the rebate. ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates","Okay, and then the Affordable Choice plans that you sell will have that lower \u2013 will have the total [inaudible]? ","Rob Pollock ","","I mean, we\u2019re going to get \u2013 our reported overall loss ratio is going to be a blend of MLR products and non-MLR products.  ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates","Okay.  That\u2019s what I wanted to know.  Thank you.  ","Operator","","We\u2019ll go next to the site of Mark Hughes with Suntrust. Your line is open. ","","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","Good morning.  The placement rate on the new 300,000 loan block, how does that compare to the 650,000 that you brought on this quarter, or fourth quarter? ","Rob Pollock ","","I don\u2019t think we have full line of sight on the 300,000 we\u2019re adding yet, Mark.  ","Mike Peninger","","Well, we do think, as we said earlier, it\u2019s going to be higher than the Black\u2019s average.  So it\u2019s not like a, you know, we\u2019ve had a couple of portfolios that have had placement rates that are more like the 1-percenters or something.  This is going to be higher than that.  ","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","Yeah, with the 650, did you say that 200,000 of those were flat canceled? ","Rob Pollock","","Correct. ","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","Within the 300,000 loans, how many of those are going to flat canceled? ","Rob Pollock ","","Those are going to be flat canceled as well. ","Mike Peninger","","All of them. ","Rob Pollock ","","So that will impact our premiums, you know, start \u2013 depending on exactly the date of the flat cancel. ","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","Right, so actually a higher number of flat cancels in this new block? ","Rob Pollock ","","Right. ","Mike Peninger","Right.  Once we take over the business, it will all come flat cancel.  ","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","Right.  And then you mentioned a couple time, portfolios passing between servicers in the months ahead.  Is that to say there\u2019s a lot of visibility you\u2019ve got for incremental pickups? ","Rob Pollock ","","Exactly.  In other words, you know, we \u2013 if you look over the course of \u201912, we won some portfolios through RFP.  But you know, our alignment with leaders has really helped us.  If we look at the general trend that\u2019s going on, you know, and put this over perspective, in the \u201808\/\u201909 timeframe, a movement from specialty to money center bank.  Now we\u2019re seeing a movement away from money center bank to specialty server and our alignment with the leaders has us positioned as those movements occur.  ","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","And do you still go through the RFP process in those cases? ","Rob Pollock ","","Not when it\u2019s just a loan portfolio that, you know, the servicing rates might be purchased by another servicer.  ","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you very much. ","Operator","","We\u2019ll take our final question from the site of Seth Weiss with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.  Your line is open.  ","Seth Weiss \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Good morning.  I have a question on free cash flow emergence going forward, specifically within health and specialty property.  I know that the health given was 160 in 2012 and you mentioned capital efficiencies in that business.  So if you could think about how the \u2013 help us think about how we could think about that for 2013?  And then specialty property, I know that the long-term visibility is a little bit less than the placement rates, the fluctuate around, but can you let us know how to think about capital release in that business, maybe as it relates to the total risk in force coming down as placement rates come down over the next few years? ","Rob Pollock ","","Sure.  So let me start and then maybe Mike can comment on property.  But on the health side, an important thing to remember there is first, on all these businesses, we capitalize to AM best ratios but because of where health \u2013 our health business was and the evolution, we didn\u2019t take any dividends for several years even though we made money.  This year, if you look at the money we took out, we took out several years\u2019 worth of earnings as a result of that because it has been sitting there and the rating agencies were comfortable with the progress we made that that made sense.  You know, Mike, you want to talk about how to think about capital on the property side? ","Mike Peninger","","Yeah, in property, we\u2019ve talked about, you know, the capital in the business or the equity being, you know, in that 50 to 55% of premium and so as the \u2013 and one of the drivers of the capital equipments is the premiums.  So as premium were to moderate, you know, capital potentially can come out, although it has to be due to changes in exposure, you know, that\u2019s what fundamentally \u2013 the premium is sort of used as a surrogate for exposure, so as exposure is reduced, then we can take the capital out of the business.  ","Seth Weiss \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, understood.  So if we think about it that way, the next-generation product also will have a little bit of [inaudible] benefit as exposure comes down with the reductions in premium related to that, right? ","Mike Peninger","","Correct. ","Seth Weiss \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great.  Thanks.  And just one mechanical follow up on specialty property and loans tracked, if we look at 31.2 million loans tracked, that encompasses the \u2013 just the 200,000 that are flat canceled, there\u2019ll be 450 on top of that which will emerge overtime, right? ","Rob Pollock","","No.  ","Mike Peninger","","I think the full 650 go into the loan count, the way we do the calculation. ","Rob Pollock ","","Right.  So I think that what\u2019s not in that 31.2 is the ones that are going to be added in the first quarter.  ","Mike Peninger","","Right, but also, if you\u2019re trying to reconcile, you\u2019ve got attrition, you know, in the existing portfolio, so we start with the 30.8 or whatever it was.  We add 650 and then we get some attrition and that\u2019s how we end up at the whatever, 31.2 or something.  ","Seth Weiss \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","I see.  And just out of curiosity because I know you\u2019ve added a bunch of new portfolios over the last 12 months, is there a way to think about the gap between those that are still rolling on with the renewal process, Chris? ","Chris Pagano","","Well, the loans go onto the system, that\u2019s what we\u2019re tracking.  You know, it\u2019s policies related to those loans that come on over time.  ","Rob Pollock ","","It\u2019s really the placements that are going to occur on the loans, which is a good point you\u2019re driving that, that we will still have  pickup in some placements on some of the portfolios that were flat canceled.

You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter 2018. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com.","We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.","As a reminder on May 31st, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group, or TWG. Beginning June 1st, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results, the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March and related costs.","Dividends on the preferred stock issued as part of the deal financing are an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. In addition, starting August 1st, the mortgage solutions business is no longer included in operating results, given the sale.","Some of the statements made today maybe forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.","During today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone.","Overall, the third quarter was in line with our expectations. This marks the first full quarter since closing our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We are pleased with performance thus far and we're starting to jointly develop new offerings to capitalize on our leading position in the global automotive market.","We remain focused on completing our global integration and are on track to deliver on our commitment of $60 million policies of run rate operating synergies by the end of next year.","Results for the quarter also included solid organic growth across Connected Living, Preneed, and multifamily housing. We believe this momentum will help sustain profitable growth.","As we pre-announced we incurred more than $50 million of after-tax losses related to Hurricane Florence, well within the retention limit of our reinsurance program.","I want to thank all of our employees who supported our policyholders in their time of need.","Let me now share some recent highlights for our three business segments. They underscore our ongoing success building strong partnerships with leading brands, our focus on innovation, and customer excellence.","Starting with Global Lifestyle, the segment posted solid earnings for the quarter, particularly in mobile, where new subscriber growth more than offset higher loss experience and lower trade-in volumes. Mobile revenue increased 12% as Global Protection programs launched last year continued to gain momentum. In total, we now protect more than 44 million devices worldwide. And we continue to gain traction in the mobile marketplace.","Most recently, in September, we worked with Apple to launch AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss. This represents Apple's newest and most comprehensive option in its family of device protection plans available on their stores, online, and select resellers like BestBuy. The offering provides coverage for hardware service, accidental damage, theft and loss, as well as software and technical support, something we believe continues to be a growing need for consumers. This comes on the heels of several other device programs we helped launched globally in the last two years to enable our carrier and cable partners to offer access to AppleCare services. While still very early, performance has been tracking our expectations.","Also on the one-year anniversary of our partnership with KDDI, we expanded our relationship by introducing an enhanced mobile device support program for all of their Apple customers in Japan. This includes four years of coverage for mechanical breakdown, accidental damage and loss and theft. We are encouraged by the success with KDDI and look forward to finding new and unique ways to serve them and their end-consumers.","Global Automotive business also continues to generate strong top-line growth, with more than 47 million protected vehicles worldwide. As the industry evolves, we're making targeted investments to expand our connected car capabilities.","During the quarter, we made a strategic investment in Mojio, a leading technology platform and software service provider for connected cars, as we explore digital protection and support solutions for vehicle owners and automotive partners. We are finding ways to enhance our vehicle protection offerings with real-time telematics data and remote diagnostic information. This is in addition to connecting vehicle owners and their cars with numerous on-demand services. Overall, we see opportunities to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connected lifestyle of consumers.","Turning to Global Housing, this segment generated solid results excluding catastrophe losses. We continue to evolve and strengthen our specialty property offerings where we have leadership positions and differentiated capabilities. Our lender-placed insurance franchise remains strong and generates substantial cash flow. We recently renewed two significant clients with multi-year agreements and continue to make progress with our operating system migration. As we close out 2018, we believe lender-placed earnings will stabilize next year, after several years of market declines.","In multifamily housing, we continue to generate strong growth with a nearly 11% increase in revenue this quarter and we now protect 2 million renters across the U.S. During the quarter, we became the exclusive provider of renters insurance to Village Green, one of the nation's premier property management companies providing our suite of renters' products and services to their more than 25,000 rental units in the U.S.","Over the last several years we have steadily built out our capabilities and offerings in the sharing economy space. We have focused on three key areas. On-demand mobility insurance mainly an auto peer-to-peer and car fleet sharing shared accommodations primarily in the vacation rental market and shipping insurance.","We now work with around 30 clients including some of the most sought after brand names in this sharing economy market like Etsy, GMs car sharing program Maven, and Flexdrive. Well, not yet a significant driver of revenue or earnings, we believe this is an area of growth potential we have developed to recognized brand, due to our innovative and adaptive approach.","Overall, we believe these specialty offerings will help support profitable growth for Global Housing in the years ahead.","And finally, Global Preneed. The segment posted record earnings driven by recent growth in sales and total assets under management. Our specialty products in the alignment with SCI in North America and other market leaders in Canada are key differentiators.","We've recently expanded our offerings to include ancillary products such as support and assistance to world executive tours and those navigating the state planning process. Overall Preneed continues to produce strong returns and robust cash flows.","Turning to our consolidated financial results, we currently measure our success against three key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share, and operating return on equity all excluding catastrophe losses.","Beginning in June, these metrics include results for TWG and related acquisition financing. For the first nine months of 2018, Assurant's net operating income increased by $58 million or 19% year-over-year to $371 million, driven by contributions from TWG, a lower effective tax rate, and organic growth.","Operating earnings per diluted share was $6.37, up 13%. Annualized operating return on equity excluding AOCI was 11%, up 60 basis points since year-end mainly due to growth in earnings.","At the end of September holding company capital totaled $473 million after returning $119 million in share repurchases and common dividends in the quarter. We also recently announced a new $600 million share repurchase authorization. This brings our total available authorization to $776 million as of November 2nd. As always, our buybacks are subject to market conditions and other factors.","We are committed to managing our capital prudently, maintaining balance sheet strength, and sustaining our track record of investing in the business to support long-term profitable growth. All of this while returning excess capital to shareholders over time.","As we approach the end of 2018, we continue to expect Assurant net operating earnings excluding reportable catastrophes to increase 20% to 25% from last year.","As we look ahead to 2019, we remain focused on continuing to grow earnings and cash flow. To do so, we are fostering even greater collaboration across our lines of business to leverage our newly expanded global scale and expertise. This will be especially important as our lifestyle and housing markets converge around the connected consumer. We see opportunities to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness across our global operations through simplification, standardization, and deployment of technologies such as artificial intelligence. And technology investments, we've made this year will support an even better customer experience across channels globally.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our third quarter 2018 results and outlook in greater detail. Richard?","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you, Alan, and good morning everyone.","Let's start with Global Housing, where net operating income totaled $19 million for the third quarter compared to a net loss of $110 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $120 million of lower tax. Third quarter included $67 million of losses related to wind and flood damage from Hurricane Florence and an increase in reserves for claims from Hurricane Maria.","As a reminder, we incurred a total of $187 million in cat losses in the third quarter of last year. Excluding catastrophe losses, and the tax rate change, net operating income declined by $8 million year-over-year, driven by less favorable non-catastrophe loss experience and expected declines in lender-placed.","We also incurred additional technology expenses as we reinvested a portion of our tax savings with additional investments planned for the fourth quarter.","Growth from our Affinity partners and property management companies and multifamily housing and more favorable non-cat loss experience from other specialty property products like International Dwelling partially offset the decline.","The risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses excluding cat losses increased to 83.2% from 80.7% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to less favorable non-cat loss experience from other weather-related claims and water damage in lender-placed insurance, a trend we expect to continue through year-end.","We also incurred higher expenses in the quarter to support new business. With the sale of mortgage solutions and the expansion of other specialty property offerings, we are reevaluating Global Housing's profitability metrics for our capital-light businesses. We expect to share our conclusions with you along with relevant segment targets at our upcoming Investor Day in March.","Moving to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premium and fees were down slightly in the third quarter, reflecting the sale of mortgage solutions on August 1st. Excluding mortgage solutions, revenue was up 9% driven by growth in our commercial property products and multifamily housing. Revenue also increased from the absence of catastrophe reinstatement premiums which were paid in the prior-year period. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in lender-placed premiums mainly from lower real estate owned volumes and declining placement rates.","The placement rate for lender-placed dropped 15 basis points year-over-year or three basis points from the second quarter in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall strength of the housing market and a higher mix of low placement loans. We expect placement rate declines to continue to moderate.","As we preannounced fourth quarter results will include claims from Hurricane Michael. We continue to process claims and based on our view today, we believe losses will likely be in the range of $75 million to $105 million pretax. This is below our cat reinsurance prevent retention of $120 million. Excluding catastrophe losses, we expect Global Housing net operating income for this year to increase, driven by the benefit of a lower U.S. tax rate. While earnings will be lower absent tax, we are encouraged by the progress we've made to refocus our housing portfolio and moderate lender-placed declines. In addition, we expect to continue to grow revenue and earnings in multifamily housing and other specialty offerings over the long-term.","Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment earnings increased to $76 million for the third quarter. This included $29.9 million from acquisition of The Warranty Group. Net of $2.5 million primarily related to intangible amortization. This also includes $5 million in realized operating synergies in the quarter.","We also saw solid organic growth in Connected Living mainly from new mobile programs launched in 2017 and ongoing expense management efforts within our extended service contract business.","Effective tax rate was not a driver in the quarter because the net benefit from tax reform was nearly matched by a one-time gain in 2017.","Lifestyle growth was partially offset by continued declines in financial services driven by discontinued partnerships, as we reposition our offerings within the banking sector.","Turning to revenue, net earned premiums and fees were up $700 million year-over-year primarily due to the $626 million contribution from TWG. We saw continued growth in the North American auto business predominantly through the national dealer distribution channel.","Organic growth within Global Lifestyle was driven by higher service contract volumes from our third-party distribution channel within global auto and strong subscriber growth for mobile programs which started in 2017. Lower mobile trade-in volumes and a depreciation of the Argentine peso partially offset this increase.","Turning to the segments profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses improved to 97.2% from 99.2% due to catastrophe loss experience and the favorable impact from the TWG acquisition. As a reminder, in the third quarter 2017, we incurred losses mainly in our auto business of $7.7 million related to Hurricane Harvey compared to $1.4 million of claims this quarter related to Hurricane Florence.","The pretax margin for fee-based capital-light businesses was 5.3% in the third quarter or 6.5% excluding TWG earnings. This compares to 3.8% in the prior year period. Overall the improvement was driven by higher profit from global mobile programs started in 2017 and realized expense savings in the extended service contract business. Less favorable U.S. loss experience and lower contributions from Europe partially offset the increase.","As noted last quarter, the Connected Living margins reflect the inclusion of the TWG business mainly more service contract offerings with lower margins.","Overall for full-year 2018, we expect continued organic growth in Global Lifestyle driven by mobile and global automotive. Global Lifestyle earnings growth this year will reflect the TWG acquisition and organic growth along with the benefit of a lower effective U.S. tax rate. Organic growth should be mainly driven by mobile, partially offset by declines in financial services.","Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $70 million in net operating income. This was an increase of $4.5 million year-over-year. Results included a $2 million benefit from the lower U.S. tax rate net of some reinvestments in the business. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings were up from greater investment income due to both higher invested assets and interest rates as well as growth in the business. Revenue in Preneed was up 8% for the quarter. Growth was driven by prior period sales of pre-funded funerals and the Final-Need product across U.S. and Canada. Base sales increased for the second consecutive quarter from expansion of our Final-Need product with new distribution partners. To a lesser degree, results benefited from greater volume of pre-funded funeral offerings in Canada and the U.S. As a reminder, last year sales were adversely impacted by the significant hurricane activity in the quarter.","We are pleased with Preneed strong results, but expect to see earnings moderate in the fourth quarter, given seasonality and higher mortality as we near the winter months. For the full-year, we still expect Preneed earnings will increase modestly for the impact of tax. Business from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings should drive this expansion.","At Corporate, the net operating loss was $19 million a year-over-year increase of $6 million. Approximately half of the increase was due to higher employee-related expenses as well as some additional technology investments. The other half was related to an adverse impact from the lower effective tax rate.","For the fourth quarter, we expect the corporate loss to increase from third quarter levels, similar to historic trends. Continued investments in our artificial intelligence, the Connected Home and the Connected Car should also be drivers. As a result, we believe that Corporate operating loss will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million for the full-year as previously discussed. This includes the adverse impact of lower U.S. tax rate at roughly 20% with some investment. This will be partially offset by continued expense management.","Turning to capital. We ended September with $473 million in total holding company capital or about $223 million of deployable capital. Dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle, and Preneed totaled $139 million and this included $75 million from the TWG entities. We also received $35 million for the August 1st sale of mortgage solutions.","Looking at outflows, we deployed $83 million in share buybacks and $40 million in dividends. This is comprised of $35 million for our common stock and $5 million for our preferreds. In the fourth quarter through November 2nd, we have purchased 333,000 shares for approximately $34 million.","For the full-year 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings. This is mainly due to excess dividend capacity from the reduction of our deferred tax liability and full-year dividends from TWG. Excluding this deferred tax liability and dividends from TWG, Assurant dividends are still expected to be aligned with their segment earnings, inclusive of catastrophe losses.","As always, our dividend outlook is subject to customary regulatory capital requirements, rating agency considerations, and the profitable growth of the businesses.","In summary, we're pleased with our performance this quarter and we remain focused on delivering on our full-year commitments, a strong financial position as well for continued profitable growth in 2019.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. Our first question is coming from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning, Kai.","Kai Pan","Thank you. Good morning, Alan. So my first question is on your homeowners business, if you look at past three years your cat losses have been -- you have three consecutive years of cat losses above your long-term average. I just wonder can you reflect on your volatility versus your expectation, your reinsurance program, and would you consider down the road separating out this business because that results have been masked with the progress you're making on the warranty business.","Alan Colberg","Yes, no Kai, so few thoughts on this. So first of all I think we feel very good about the reinsurance program we have in place, you saw last year which was a very extreme weather year that the program worked well. We were not really that affected by the company other than the losses we took and so we feel like we've done a good job of protecting our customers, our policyholders, our shareholders with the program.","Over the years, we've been gradually reducing our retention so that our exposure has gone down significantly and as we've added other lines of business like The Warranty Group and with the growth in Connected Living and Mobile a much smaller portion of our earnings is cat exposed today. But certainly the last few years have been more volatile for storms than in the past and we will be revisiting our reinsureds program what's the right retention point as we go into the repurchase cycle for that in January.","Kai Pan","So do you think this is still core business for you to keep in the foreseeable future?","Alan Colberg","Yes, absolutely. If you look at Global Housing, we've gone through a few years of market declines and lender-placed which are now largely behind us. We're positioned as we've said for flat earnings in lender-placed next year excluding cat which is very positive and we've got strong growth across the balance of Global Housing. So we feel very good about that business as we look to 2019 and beyond.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. My second question on the Lifestyle margin 5.3% this quarter, this improvements from last year's results but you highlight that The Warranty Group probably dragged the margin by 1, 1.2 points and you also highlight some less favorable loss experience in Mobile and Europe, could you quantify sort of like the margin impact from those like on your core business outside The Warranty Group?","Richard Dziadzio","Good morning, Kai. It's Richard and I think you phrased it correctly. I mean -- we -- overall it's an improvement from last year 3.8%. So positive news there, but we do note, we have noted in the past that when we bring the TWG business in, the margins were a little bit lower. So that does bring it down relative to what it had been as you mentioned, it ultimately ends up being a business mix we have, and then also as we called out there was some impact from Europe and some losses but fairly, fairly small overall in the mix.","Alan Colberg","Yes, and Kai, I would add, I think over the last few years we've been very pleased with the margin growth that we've seen in Lifestyle. We did allude to in this quarter we had the normal seasonality the third quarter usually is the worst loss experience in Mobile. And in Europe what we're working through in the U.S. we control our supply chain. In Europe in Mobile we work with partners and so that's had more challenges for us and so we're working through solutions as we head into 2019 to have more control over our mobile supply chain in Europe.","Kai Pan","Okay. Is your 9.5% margin target for the segments still achievable over the next few years given now you have TWG in the mix?","Alan Colberg","Yes, we're going to have an Investor Day in March where we will refresh what the right way to think about that is. If you recall a couple of years ago, we changed the target from 8% to the 9.5% we have now as a result of the way one of our contract changes happened. So we'll revisit all of that but I think the main headline for us is we've had good growth in margins over the last few years and we're going to remain focused on growing the margins.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Nadel from UBS.","Alan Colberg","Hey good morning, John.","Richard Dziadzio","Good morning.","John Nadel","Yes, good morning. Yes, now I think it would be great for you to sell your lender-placed business at the cyclical placement very low. Anyway, Alan, the new Apple program, can you go into that in a little bit more detail, it sounds like -- it sounds on the surface from your description like it's pretty incremental maybe even significant but I just want to understand that better?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So maybe we have many partnerships across the Connected Living space, one that we're proud of and is important to us is Apple that really began years ago in Brazil when we worked with them to really launch a trade-in program in that market, they were an important part of our progress and success in Japan. And off of that we were able to build enough I think great relationship, credibility that they chose to work with us as their partner in really extending and deepening AppleCare.","So we've included our capabilities into AppleCare, we're now distributing it through them in their stores through apple.com. So it's going to be significant broadly the relationship we have with Apple and we continue to grow it in various markets around the world.","John Nadel","Okay, that's helpful. The second question is just lender-placed, it looks like the placement rate is slowing -- the decline in the placement rate is slowing down and I think you guys have been talking about for a while that that's stabilizing at some point here in the relatively near-term. If we think about though your 2019 outlook for earnings for that segment or for that business ex-cat, can we see earnings for lender-placed to grow if the placement rate actually does stabilize and wouldn't the driver there be the migration to the single operating platform, I think you had expected that there'd be pretty significant cost savings from that?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, good morning, John. It's Richard.","John Nadel","Hi, Richard.","Richard Dziadzio","I think you hit on a lot of good points there, I think as we said in our statements a little bit earlier, we do see the placement rate decreasing or a decrease in the decrease so to speak, so it was only three basis points over the last quarter. So we see that continuing to moderate as we go forward. We're not calling an inflection point because obviously it depends on a lot of macro events, how the housing market is doing.","Having said that I think you did hit on the fact that it is decreasing that we're in the process of implementing a single source platform over the next few years, that will start coming in and start helping as we go along. So we do feel that we're turning a corner and the large part of the decreases is behind us. So we're feeling really good about the business.","John Nadel","Okay. And then last one and then I'll get back in the queue as I'm just thinking about the Corporate $250 million capital buffer, I'm wondering whether that can be reduced if I think back many years ago on the rationale for that buffer, I think you related at least in part maybe in large part to some of the pandemic type of risk that existed when you guys were still in the health and the employee benefit businesses, so am I right in that sort of recollection and any chance you can re-evaluate whether that cushion can come down?","Alan Colberg","Yes, John, I mean I think if I take a long-view we're very proud of the way we've managed the capital of the company for both our creditors and our shareholders. And as we work toward Investor Day next March, we are looking at how we think about capital, how we think about what's the appropriate buffer where we hold it and so I'll defer that question in March, but we have work underway to how best to think about that to protect our creditors and our shareholders and grow our company.","John Nadel","Okay, but that that's seems to go.","Alan Colberg","Yes.","John Nadel","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.","Alan Colberg","Hey good morning, Jimmy.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. Hi so first I had a question on just your expense savings program and if you could just discuss progress on that and just the expected trajectory of expenses in next few years, how much of the cost savings you expect to fall to the bottom-line and by when?","Richard Dziadzio","I'll take it. Okay, good morning, Jimmy. Yes, so in terms of overall expenses, I mean we continue to drive hard on managing our expenses, our overall headcount et cetera. As I mentioned in the remarks, we were on track for our synergies with TWG, we took out $5 million, looking forward to at least $10 million for the end of this year, and on a run rate basis being half of the $60 million we talked about across the enterprise, we're working on things like procurement and facilities et cetera and being very careful about how we are spending and making sure that whatever we spend, we're creating value.","In terms of the saves back in Investor Day, we had talked about $100 million of gross saves in last quarter we reported that we were halfway to that mark. We continue to advance. So this quarter I would just say we're a little bit above that mark and continuing to move forward and in terms of the goal that we had set there for being a $100 million at the end of 2020, we're well in track for that.","Alan Colberg","Yes, and Jimmy you can see some of the benefit of it flowing through the P&L for example our pretax margin that we're talking about earlier in Connected Living, some of that growth is coming from these expense initiatives. You can also see it in Corporate where our loss for this year, if tax adjusted is effectively the same as last year and we're a much bigger company this year. So we've been able to grow the company without adding corporate expense. So we're seeing significant benefits already coming through the P&L even as Richard said we're still in process on these.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then on the acquired Warranty Group business have you've been able to look at it little bit -- take a little bit more deeper look at it. Have your views on any of the financial metrics that you gave out changed positively or negatively?","Alan Colberg","No, what I would say is I think we're very pleased with the Warranty Group the integration so far. The client feedback has been strong both our clients and their clients about the fact that we're a stronger deeper company you can help adapt and build new products for the evolving auto market. We've said the deal we expected to be modestly accretive on 2019, by the end of 2019 run rate synergies; we're still on track for that, we're still on track to meet our cost savings commitments. So I think we feel very good about it and it really has strategically strengthened us in the auto market.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then just lastly on the Preneed business, your earnings are higher than they've been I think in the last several years on a quarterly basis and part of that was just very high investment income. So just any insight into what drove that? And is this sustainable level of earnings, I understand there's seasonality in earnings typically declined in 4Q but other than seasonality, if you think that this being a sustainable level of earnings in that business?","Richard Dziadzio","Well we see some, thank you, Jimmy. We see some good momentum in the business as we said. Sales were up quarter-over-quarter. We're bringing in new clients and we're very pleased about that. The product offering is being accepted well by the marketplace. So that organic growth is helpful obviously Preneed is more of a longer-term business and those profits are spread out in the future. But in this particular quarter we had not only effects of the past, good news coming through, but we also had higher overall assets in the business and higher overall interest rates really just reflect, what's happening out there in the markets. So we do feel that there's good momentum going forward despite some seasonality that that we get sort of in the winter months.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning, Mark.","Mark Hughes","Thank you very much. Good morning, Alan. With Apple, sounds like a nice expansion of the relationship, how much more is there to go, how meaningful is your penetration with Apple versus other suppliers perhaps is this are we going to continue to see further expansion?","Alan Colberg","Well you know it's early in the U.S. relationship with Apple and we will hopefully execute that well. So far as I mentioned is performing to expectations. And our focus really is been to evolve our products and services if the market evolves, so as you've heard us talk about before we've gone from the original handset protection into things like premium tech support and on-board phone diagnostics and more recently with an extended warranty in Japan on the phone. So I think there's a lot of runway broadly in mobile with our various partners around the world.","Mark Hughes","Yes, manufactured housing and other you mentioned international dwelling, could you expand a little more on that, was the big growth number at least within that category in the quarter? Just refresh us on what you're doing there and is this kind of growth sustainable?","Richard Dziadzio","In terms of the international area in manufactured housing that's really going to be dwelling, where we have partnerships with clients and offering that insurance there. And then, more domestically we do have an increase in commercial property we have a small program there small size type premiums and starting to get a little bit of growth there is as well.","Mark Hughes","Is this sort of traction that can be sustained with this a book roll or something that might have driven growth in this quarter or this something that the relationship should help drive volume -- similar volume growth in coming quarters?","Alan Colberg","No, Mark, I think the way I think about this is we're running various pilots as we try to look for example I referenced in my remarks the sharing economy that's part of what I think close to what you're referencing and it's early but we are building new relationships, new distribution partners, and we feel like we've established our brand and we'll see how successful these programs are over time but so far we're gaining good traction.","Mark Hughes","Last question you sort of touched on this, Alan, but if I think about 2019 you definitely walk us through a lot of new programs, a lot of new initiatives emerging products. And obviously those involved investments, when we think about how all this stacked up for 2019 is that a margin expansion year, is it an investment year, how do you think about next year?","Alan Colberg","Yes, Mark, what I would say is we will provide a full outlook for 2019 as part of our Q4 earnings call in February, but we do feel very well-positioned for continued profitable growth and we look forward to a good 2019 as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Campbell with KBW.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning Chris.","Christopher Campbell","Hey, good morning. I guess just a few questions on Global Housing just to start off I guess so how much capital is freed up as the LTI placement rate declines?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, good morning Chris. There obviously is a little bit of capital freed up as it -- I would say declines but again I come back to the earlier comments that that decline is getting smaller and smaller. So we don't see big releases because that business I would say is in a good -- is getting to be in a really nice place with only three basis point decrease in placements rates this year. You can see actually in the top-line and the net earned premiums not a big move there. So we're really not looking at the release of capital from property to increase the overall I would say ROEs with the company that's going to come from the profitable growth across housing and across the capital parts of lifestyle business like Global Auto.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. And then just a question on the Global Housing guidance. So there is some, there is some qualitative statements in there Global Housing savings by year-end 2018 and into 2019. Have you've been able to realize cease through some numbers on that yet just in terms of what you're thinking as saving on the expense base there?","Richard Dziadzio","I would say this sort of again I'll come back to Alan's earlier comments about we'll do outlook and be more specific about 2019 when Q4 comes around. But as we look at Global Housing, we see that we do have an expense ratio that's elevated as the revenues have come down and we haven't yet put in all the platform. That will come in over the next year so we do see that expense ratio coming back down over the next few years, I would say more gradually than rapidly in 2019.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, thanks, that's very helpful. And then just pivoting to Global Lifestyle and thinking about the new AppleCare relationship, how should we think about premium growth and then the margin performance particularly as this relationship develops and potentially expands?","Alan Colberg","So we normally don't give any specifics on clients and the performance of the given client. What I would say about Lifestyle broadly, we've had a longstanding commitment that we can on average grow that businesses earnings by 10% per year. Now it's not 10% every year sometimes it's more, sometimes it's less. And if you go back to 2013, when we first put out that commitment, we've delivered on that and we feel well-positioned to continue to deliver on that in part because of expanding relationships like with Apple and KDDI and Comcast and others that we've talked about.","Christopher Campbell","Got it. And then just as you\u2019re thinking about like all the cat -- going back to Global Housing for a second, if you\u2019re thinking about like the cat, is there anything else that you can do on the reinsurance side potentially to save cost especially as you're bringing in some new products?","Richard Dziadzio","I think its Richard. As Alan mentioned earlier, we have over time I guess I would say brought down the retention rate, the market obviously is very receptive to our placing reinsurance. I mean we've worked with the reinsurance market for a long period of time; we have some good stable reinsurers in there. So I think just as the relationship we have with them, the knowledge they have with our business will helps us get very good pricing in the marketplace when we do that. But we are thinking about as we go forward, what is should our retention be, should we bring it down, what our aggregate. So there\u2019s we've got some pretty smart people in the company that spend a lot of time thinking about exactly how we should position it and we'll give more guidance on that as we go forward.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, thanks for all the answers. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Richard Dziadzio","Okay, thanks.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Nadel with UBS.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning again, John.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning again, thanks for the follow-up. I think Alan if I go back over the past couple of months, it seems like the tone shifted just a little bit in terms of whether you guys could participate in buying back stock directly or as part of TPG sale. I'm just wondering if there's any clarity on that given obviously you guys are in great vision to be able to do that if they decided to sell more stock?","Alan Colberg","John, what I would say about TPG is as I've said there they've been and we expect them to continue to be economically rationale as they sell their positions. We were encouraged by their first two sales that happened earlier. And as we think about the future, I'm not going to speculate on what they might do or what we might do. But I think they'll continue to be economically rationale.","John Nadel","Yes, no, I\u2019m not asking for you to speculate on what they'll do obviously they will do whatever they do but I'm just curious whether from a legal perspective or structural perspective I guess and you guys participate to the extent that they -- that they decided that they want to sell.","Alan Colberg","Yes, legally we could. But again or let's just see how this plays out, but I think so far it\u2019s played out well.","John Nadel","Yes, and then second question little bit more delicate, Alan, but let me phrase it this way, there's a couple -- a couple of months ago maybe there was some speculation that you guys were maybe approached by a large foreign insurance company and there was some specificity around what that company may have offered, I'm not looking for you to confirm whether an approach actually took place unless of course you want to. But what I am interested is the thought process you and the board might go through, if such an approach did take place and I'm thinking about this primarily given the longer-term growth story, you're laying out is pretty attractive global vehicle, mobile, renter's just to name a few and then all the new product expansion that you guys are investing in today. It just seems your top and bottom-line growth over the next several years, if not longer be pretty strong and I just want to understand how you and the board would balance that longer-term growth outlook against the near-term potential offer.","Alan Colberg","Yes, I appreciate that. First we never comment on market rumors I won't comment on that. We do feel very well-positioned as a company. We've driven profitable growth the last couple of years. We are well-positioned in many lines of business, continue to grow. I'm a Director we have a fiduciary duty to create value for our shareholders and if somebody did approach us with an attractive offer we obviously would take it appropriately.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Alan Colberg","Hi, Kai.","Kai Pan","Thank you for the follow-up. Yes I just one follow-up on the AppleCare. Do you have any early indication of the take up rates, how does that compare with your typical mobile offerings?","Alan Colberg","Again we normally don't go into specifics of any given client program what I would say is, it is performing as we expect.","Kai Pan","All right, I think I'll give a try. Thank you so much. Good luck.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Kai.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Alan Colberg","Hi, Mark.","Mark Hughes","Yes, good morning. Thank you. And just on the capacity retention maybe even this is more of a comment but you see some of the Florida specific carriers that have reduced their retention. It would be interesting as the investor and analyst to see kind of the tradeoff of lowering your retention and what that would mean to quarterly earnings reasonable case could probably be made that it would end up being a net positive for the value creation, let's call it the multiple that the market would be willing to pay for your stream of earnings with lower volatility a lot of big diversified companies have made the decision that that cat exposure and these volatile quarters are just not worth it. I think over the long-term, they probably are, but the -- it would be, it would be interesting to see what the tradeoff would be on that front. So just and I know that's a decision you make internally but it seems like a lot of folks have gone in that direction. Anyway so no question there just a little pontificating. Thank you.","Richard Dziadzio","No, Mark. It's Richard just to respond to your statements. I would say I think you're spot on with them. And we have as I mentioned earlier working groups working on exactly that to think of I think about it as we do have a cursor to set in terms of exactly what risk we accept, what risk we lay off and what is the stability of the earnings overall. We've brought it down our earnings are more stable.","As Alan said, in an earlier question, our company is getting bigger and so the exposure we have to catch is getting smaller just by definition, particularly as multifamily grows and lifestyle grows. So we definitely are looking at all of those things and but I would say if we -- if we look year-to-date through Q3 even with Hurricane Florence we had a little bit sub 92% combined ratio, so even there that's a nice ROE for the business overall.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Alan Colberg","All right, thanks Mark. I want to thank everyone for participating in today's call. We're pleased with our results so far this year and we look forward to updating you on progress for our fourth quarter earnings call in February and we are going to hold an Investor Day now scheduled for March 14th in New York and more details will be coming on that in the coming months. In the meantime please reach out to Suzanne Shepherd or Sean Moshier with any follow-up questions. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode throughout today\u2019s call, until after our prepared remarks and then we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  ","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Melissa Kivett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, Ms. Kivett. ","Melissa Kivett","","Thanks, Lauren, and good morning, everyone.  We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2012 results review.  Joining me for Assurant\u2019s conference call are Rob Pollock, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Peninger, our Chief Financial Officer and Chris Pagano, our Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer. ","Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter results.  Both the release and corresponding supplemental financial information are available at Assurant.com.  ","Please not that all prior period financial information presented in the release supplement and on this call reflects the new accounting guidance for deferred acquisition costs, which the company adopted at January 1, 2012.  ","We\u2019ll start today\u2019s call with brief remarks from Rob and Mike, and Chris participating in the Q&A.  Some of the statements we make on today\u2019s call may be forward looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements.  Additional information on the factor that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday\u2019s news release as well as our SEC reports, including our 2011 Form 10-K, available at Assurant.com.  ","Today\u2019s call will also contain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company\u2019s performance.  For more details of these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and the financial supplement posted on our website at Assurant.com.  ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob. ","Rob Pollock","","Thanks, Melissa, and good morning everyone.  We are pleased with our results in the first quarter with each business increasing earnings compared to the first quarter of 2011.  We also continued to return capital to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital position.  ","We measure our performance against three important financial metrics.  First, we reported an annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI of 14.6% during the first quarter. ","Second, growth in book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was 3.5% during the quarter.  ","Third, revenue, defined by net earned premiums and fee income, grew by over 1.5% year over year to 1.9 billion.  Despite economic challenges, we are producing profitable growth.  ","In Solutions, the areas identified for growth are service contracts, pre-need, international and mobile, which we previously described as wireless.  The term mobile recognizes the proliferation of smartphones and tablets in the lives of consumers.  Pre-need and our domestic mobile and service contract businesses are delivering returns above our ROE targets.  In international operations, profitability improved and we continue to see revenue grow in Latin America.  ","In China, we were pleased to add a prominent client, Jang Su Five Star Limited, a wholly-owned affiliate of Best Buy.  We expect this partnership to generate more than 100,000 million in annual revenue in three to four years.  ","Moving to Europe, the continuing financial crisis has triggered greater levels of austerity and a recession.  Although our results there have improved, we are taking a hard look at our performance versus expectations to ensure we can achieve our return targets in what we believe will continue to be a difficult environment.  ","In Specialty Property, we maintain the number of loans tracked, despite the overall shrinking market.  We were able to do so by winning new loan portfolios for tracking and by our clients acquiring additional loans.  We continue to expect placement rates to return to more normal levels as seriously delinquent loans start to resolve.  ","Assurant Health continues to make great progress in implementing it\u2019s strategy.  We\u2019ve been successful in expanding our distribution this year, and are pleased to announce a partnership with American Family Insurance Company.  ","American Family\u2019s broad network of agents will now exclusively sell our individual health policies to their customers.  We have a specialty strategy that can be successful no matter now the Supreme Court rules on the Healthcare Reform case.  We are focused on meeting the needs of individuals with a range of affordable product offerings.  At the same time, we are finding ways to operate more efficiently.  Small employers, the primary customers of Assurant Employee Benefits, continue to face challenging economic times.  We are further tailoring our business model to focus more sharply on voluntary products, which are increasingly important to our customers and their employees.  ","We believe our specialized voluntary enrollment and customer service capabilities already give us a competitive advantage in the small employer market.  We are investing in tools and technology to expand this advantage.  ","With that, I\u2019ll turn to Mike for more comments on the quarter.  ","Mike Peninger","Thanks Rob.  I\u2019ll discuss a few quarter highlights and priorities for each of our business segments starting with Assurant Solutions. ","During the first quarter, Solutions\u2019 growth in net earned premium and fees was again led by Latin America and we also saw growth in our domestic service contract business. The profitability of our domestic mobile pre-need and extended service contract businesses was above our ROE targets. ","The international combined ratio improved by about 230 basis points versus the first quarter of last year after adjusting for a nonrecurring premium tax benefit in Canada, with all international regions contributing to improvement.","Solutions\u2019 annualized ROE in the first quarter was just over 12% after adjusting for this disclosed item and we were pleased with the continuation of the improvement we saw last year. ","Profitability is, however, still short of the overall 14 to 16% ROE target for the business.  A major driver of the short fall continues to be Europe, which as Rob indicated, is an area of particular focus. ","Let me offer a few comments on our results there beginning with the U.K. where we\u2019ve taken many actions to improve profitability. ","We\u2019ve adjusted prices, modified contract terms, and discontinued the sale of several products. While results have steadily improved, we still do not expect the U.K. to reach breakeven profitability until mid-2013. More broadly in Europe, the poor economy has made it difficult to write new business in our other countries. We\u2019ve reduced expenses to reflect the lower growth outlook. ","The major 2012 priorities for Solutions are to continue the profitable growth in our targeted areas that we saw in the first quarter, while accelerating improvement in European profitability. We expect these efforts, along with rigorous expense control, to lead to an ROE in our target range of 14 to 16% for Solutions in 2014. ","Specialty Properties results in the first quarter were strong, aided by growth from new loan portfolios and very mild winter weather with no significant storm activity. ","Recently, we were awarded 2.1 million new loans in a competitive bidding process and expect to move them onto our system in the second quarter. Premium production will begin in the third quarter.  Our policies will replace existing policies at renewal, so implementation will be completed by the third quarter of 2013. These loans, today, have an average placement rate of about 1%. ","We were pleased by progress in our multi-family housing products, which achieved double-digit growth in net earned premium and fees as our SureDeposit acquisition continues to perform well. ","Assurant Health continued its focus on reducing operating expenses and expanding distribution. For the first quarter, expenses were down year over year by $17.4 million as we continue to simplify our operations and improve our service to customers and agents. Compared to the same period a year ago, total individual medical sales were up due to growth of health access and supplemental products. Our new network agreement with AETNA Signature Administrators and marketing agreement with American Family should improve sales of all of our individual products. ","At Assurant Employee Benefits, net operating income improved primarily due to better life insurance mortality experience. Disability incidents rates improved slightly from the elevated levels we saw in the fourth quarter but recovery experience remains challenging. ","We continue to see significant lengthening of the Social Security decision making process for disability claim adjudication, which negatively impacts our results. ","Our dental experience was slightly better than last year, as the trend for improved loss ratios continued. ","Overall, earned premiums declined due pricing actions on an assume block of disability insurance and the loss of a disability client. However, the voluntary business, again, demonstrated growth. ","Our strategic focus on distribution through key brokers and our expanded offerings continue to improve sales of voluntary products. ","Moving on to corporate matters, we ended the first quarter with $600 million in total holding company capital after returning roughly $115 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We continue to believe that our shares are attractively priced. ","Our investment portfolio continues to perform well. We remained focused on preserving the portfolios overall book yield in the low interest rate environment, and we continue to monitor events in Europe where our exposures are modest and manageable. And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Rob.","Rob Pollock ","Thanks Mike.  I want to spend a few moments to provide you with comments on our lender placed business in light of the regulatory inquiries. ","Let me start by outlining our key messages.  We utilize consumer focused processes in our notification of borrowers when there may be a potential lapse in insurance. Of the properties identified with the potential lapse, our process resolves 85% of them. This ultimately has resulted in an overall placement rate of less than 3% of the loans tracked. ","Unlike conventional carriers we cannot underwrite or exclude individual properties. Major catastrophes are frequent.  But when they do occur, the claims we pay on behalf of homeowners could be significant. Industry models have projected increased frequency in cost of catastrophes, particularly along the Eastern seaboard. ","Along with other factors, this is causing conventional carriers to raise rates and limit exposures, which impacts our business. ","To update you on developments in New York, we continue to cooperate with the Department of Financial Services, along with other companies, we will participate in their upcoming hearings. ","Overall, we continue to effectively run the business and focus on the needs of our customers and clients. Last week we rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to recognize our 120th anniversary and affirm the enduring values of Assurant; common sense, common decency, uncommon thinking, and uncommon results.  Those values are also reflected in our track record of adapting to changing markets. Our priorities are clear; to make Assurant more efficient, to focus on long-term profitable growth, and to generate superior returns for our shareholders. ","And with that, we can move into the Q&A portion of our call. Operator first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","(Operator instructions).  Our first question comes from Edward Spehar with Bank of America.","Rob Pollock","","Morning, Ed.","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Good morning, everyone.","Rob Pollock","","Ed.","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hey, a few questions.  First, clarification, the partnership with American Family, is that the Aflac American Family?","Rob Pollock","","No, it\u2019s American Family in Wisconsin, and in Madison, Wisconsin, Ed","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.  And then the second question is with regards to Europe and Solutions, the concern about the profitability there, is it the concern for the extent of, you know, the decision about whether or not it makes sense to stay in those markets, all or some of those markets?","Rob Pollock","","You know, when we look at Europe, we have had a few problems that we outlined in the UK.  We\u2019re in the process of, you know, correcting those blocks of business, Ed.  We also thought that we\u2019re opportunities to write new business, to help improve our profitability there.  And I think we\u2019re just looking at things saying, look with all the austerity moves, let\u2019s make sure we have a sharp eye on that, and can, you know, write the new business that is going to be required to get to our hurdle returns.  ","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","So, the goal of 14 to 16% ROE for Solutions in 2014 assumes that we generally are in the markets that we\u2019re in today, but we just get to our targeted margins?","Rob Pollock","","We see improvement, or are in a position to, you know, take either action that can get us there, Ed.","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then the final question is on Specialty Property, you had a strong first quarter, you have a significant new, you know, couple of million loans coming on, understanding the placement rate is lower than the 2.8 you have on the overall, but still it\u2019s a significant new customer, or significant new block of loans.  The outlook for specialty property, flattish revenue and I think slight deterioration in the combined ratio, is that just an overly conservative outlook for this year because of the uncertainty on the regulatory front, or is there something else that we\u2019re missing?","Rob Pollock","Yes, look, if you look at our history on projecting what\u2019s going to happen in the housing market, Ed, we haven\u2019t been the best at understanding what\u2019s going to happen to placement levels.  We do feel that the seriously delinquent loan portfolios have built up and, you know, if you just read everything out there, I think that servicers, the government, everybody is looking for ways of dealing with that issue, and we think that will probably start to happen this year, which will reduce the placement ratio some.","Mike Peninger","","And we look as we\u2019ve talked previously, Ed \u2013 you know, we still believe that the overall long-term trend in the lender place market is going to that steady state, you know, that we\u2019ve talked about in the past.  So the question really is just the pace of which that happens, and that\u2019s sort of reflected in our outlook too.","Rob Pollock","","Yes, so, you know, again, what we\u2019ve outlined at investor day last year is, you know, this is clearly a specialty business.  We think we will return very good returns in the business, but ultimately the placement rates are going to be lower, and our ability to predict that isn\u2019t very good, but we certainly believe that with, you know, all the issues around seriously delinquent loans, there\u2019s going to be some resolution coming.","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Rob Pollock","","Yes.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan","Good morning.  Just to follow up on the placement rates, when you do level off, where do you expect them to level off?  Would it be more like 1.5%, 1%, and recognizing that it\u2019s \u2013 that they\u2019ve held up better than what you\u2019ve expected.  ","The other question I had was just on your excess capital, you\u2019ve got 350 million above your 250 million risk buffer.  Should we assume that most of that would end up being used for share buybacks, or are you looking at acquisitions?  And related to that, is there a possibility that given all of this regulatory noise that something comes up that could cause you to temporarily suspend the buybacks?","Rob Pollock","","Okay, so, if we start and go back, Jimmy, first to the steady state, I believe at investor day, we said we think our placement rate\u2019s, steady state is more in the 1.6 to 1.8% range.  Okay, and,  you know, we\u2019ll look at that again, but that would be our best guess today as what the steady state looks like.  ","Second, you know, very consistent with our capital management.  We want to take capital and invest it in the business.  If it grows \u2013 you know, we saw a little bit of growth this quarter, I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I mean, we\u2019re pleased with that obviously, but I don\u2019t think that causes any kind of a material exchange in capital requirements today unless the growth accelerates.  ","We also are looking for, can we find acquisitions that help us build out these models,.  I think as we\u2019ve said in the past, they\u2019re likely to be smaller acquisitions that could build out the businesses.  And you know, ultimately it\u2019s the shareholder\u2019s money and we have a pretty good track record of getting money back to the shareholder, and we find things \u2013 you know, we find our shares are Mike mentioned, attractively priced.  Chris, you want to provide some insight in the capital movements during the quarter?","Chris Pagano","","Sure.  Let me walk you through a little bit of the capital flow as for the quarter.  Just a bit of a reconciliation here.  You know, we started the quarter with about 760 million of total capital.  We\u2019re able to take some dividends in the quarter, about 55 million or so, which took us up to 815 million.  We retuned 115 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We paid a coupon payment on our bonds, which is a 30 million pre-tax, and then balance, which is about 70 million, were some capital outflows at the corporate level.  ","We\u2019re keeping in mind that the first quarter is typically a higher cash outflow corporate sector, which then most of which gets build back to the segments over the course of the year.  ","The big contributor to that 70 million was that estimated tax payment of 27 million, so that leaves us with the 600 million.  You know, in terms of the dividends that we took, those dividends were taken out of the Health and the Employee Benefit segments.  We were conservative in our dividend plan in Q4 and we have some excess capital at Benefits and Health that we were able to take up in addition to their earnings for the quarter.  ","So going forward we have about, you know, both the earnings and solutions, and specialty property both now available for dividends, so you\u2019re talking about 155 or so million at the operating companies that we feel comfortable or will be able to get over the course of the year.  ","I think the important message about the deployment issue is that nothing has changed.  You know, we continue to think the share prices are attractive, the repurchases have continued through April.  If you look at the press release you\u2019ll see that we bought another 650,000 shares for another 25 million, and we\u2019re continuing to buy via 10B51, which is our preferred method because it allows us to buy back through blackouts in most cases related to earnings.  ","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan","And then the regulatory inquiries and noise doesn\u2019t concern you in any way to slow down buybacks?","Chris Pagano","","You know, again, there can be situations that could cause us not to buy back \u2013 it could be regulatory, it could be acquisition, et cetera, but you can see there\u2019s been nothing that\u2019s caused us to not buy back during, you know, this period of time, Jimmy.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay.  And just one more.  If I look at your Specialty Property results, in terms of the catastrophe losses, and you compare that to the normal homeowner\u2019s insurance companies, the frequency of CAT losses are a lot higher with the Allstate, State Farms of the world than it is with you guys.  And that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d assume you\u2019d have more quarters with a catastrophe then those guys, or CAT losses given that you\u2019ve got more of an exposure to CAT-prone areas, or you\u2019re placement rates are higher there.  So do you have any comments on that on why you\u2019re \u2013 you seem to have fewer quarters where there are any GAP losses?","Rob Pollock","","You know, I think that first, you\u2019re absolutely right, we have more exposures along the hurricane CAT corridors, I\u2019d say maybe, Jimmy.  And, you know, I\u2019d say if you look at things like, you know, the tornados, et cetera, that\u2019s just going to be a function of where our footprint is compared to where the cap happens to hit.  But you know, otherwise, I think it\u2019s going to be a function of, you know, our concentration in the state, and where the catastrophe happens.  ","Chris Pagano","","Yes, the catastrophe is, obviously, can happen anywhere, and you know, as one of the core principles of the business that we talked about over time, Jimmy, is trying to make sure that we\u2019re affiliated with a national lenders and servicers because that geographic spread of risk is important.  I\u2019d also point out, as Rob said, you know, in some cases we\u2019re seeing some of the conventional carriers pulling back from some of the coastal areas and things like that, and you know, can impact our exposure too.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","Rob Pollock","","Good morning Mark.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Good morning.  I guess I have a whole lot of little ones.  Firstly, can you just give an update on the California rate situation?  And I guess in connection with that, could the rate changes that you ultimately agreed to be retroactively applied?","Rob Pollock ","","Sure, you know, we\u2019ve had a rate filing submitted in California.  We\u2019re in discussions with the Department of Insurance out there.  I think that most of you know we\u2019ve filed for a slight rate decrease, which we\u2019ve mentioned we do periodically.  They\u2019ve asked us to look at it harder and re-file, so we\u2019re doing that.  ","Mike, can you give a little bit of a background on (inaudible)","Mike Peninger","","We\u2019ve previously disclosed our total net-earned premiums last year. In California we\u2019re about $240 million. About half of that premium, California is subject to the rate review discussions that Rob mentioned.  In terms of the retroactive, you know, I wouldn\u2019t think so.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. And I guess obviously, California does things very publically, and other states don\u2019t really follow that same approach necessarily.  Can you maybe just give an update on maybe outside of California, outside New York?  What exactly, you know, is happening on the rate side?  Are you getting similar types of inquiries, and  you know, pressures given all the headlines that you\u2019ve seen, or are those outliers?","Rob Pollock","","You know, again we have regular interactions with the State Insurance Departments everywhere, it\u2019s part of the process.  Remember, in 49 of the 50 states we\u2019re an (inaudible) carrier, and so we file rates, if we don\u2019t, the exception is for the state of Texas.  So, you know, I would not say that other than the couple you\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve seen anything out of the ordinary, and I\u2019m not even sure, you know, with California and New York this is out of the ordinary either.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. I guess just moving topic slightly, RMS 11 is having some impact on companies P&L\u2019s.  Can you give us a flavor for how that has changed you underlying exposures, and what does that mean for reinsurance buying?","Rob Pollock","","Sure, you know, I\u2019ll let Chris comment on our reinsurance program, which we can give a bit of an update on, but won\u2019t be fully placed till June.  But, our RMS 11 had, you know obviously looked at things and said there was more inland exposure than might have been represented in previous models, and also looked at how, you know, flooding impacted some of those models in the bid different way than previous models had.  ","Of course our business is a little different in terms of how it operates, so we\u2019ve had the dialogues with rating agencies and reinsurers so they understand how our model works.","Chris, you want to amplify on that a bit?","Chris Pagano","","Sure, just a couple things.  On the CAT Program again, keep in mind we placed 70% of our program already combined with the January placement, then the CAT Fund we issued in the first quarter.  We are having, and have had ongoing dialogue with our reinsurance partners. regarding in the June placement.  We feel very good about the capacity of being available.","What we do see with regard to the modeling, is that most reinsurers, and we are taking sort of a multi-model approach with adjustments based upon our views on the changes that took place in RMS 11.  As Rob mentioned, we\u2019ll update you when we finally complete the placement.  But we do feel very good that, you know, we\u2019ll potentially have some slight increases in rate.  ","What I can tell you though, is that the program has grown and given that, we have exposures in CAT-prone that means we\u2019ll be buying more insurance.  And we\u2019ll also probably lead to a change in our retentions. So, these are all factors that we\u2019re going to work into the program and we\u2019ll keep you updated when we complete the placement.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. I guess just one finale question.  Just in the medical segment, I mean there\u2019s a lot going on with the Supreme Court and what happens with the individual mandate, what happens with, you know, the entire law altogether.  It sounds like you have strategies to cover each of those, and it sounds like the outcomes of certain ones are better than others.  Could you just kind of walk through, I guess the scenario that would probably be most troublesome, which would be the individual mandate gets removed, but the ability to underwrite around pre-existing conditions, you know, is held in place? And anything else, you know, on that topic would be helpful.","Rob Pollock","","Sure. Mike? ","Mike Peninger","","I was going to say, Mark, you know, I think certainly you could envision scenarios where the rules are written in a way that, you know, if your risk can\u2019t be managed and you can\u2019t manage the pricing to be with that, you can get some negative scenarios.  However, I think what I like to think about is, healthcare cost are continuing to go up, we don\u2019t see any, you know, clear evidence that healthcare cost are going to turn anytime soon.  So, our focus on affordable products, you know, that can fit the needs of a wide range of consumers are going to work along with the expense control that we alluded to in our prepare remarks.  That\u2019s going to make us more competitive, so really the key lynch pins of our strategy are going to be valuable to us, we believe, in any scenario that comes out of the Supreme Court decision \u2026","Rob Pollock","","Just a couple of other things. If you recall, you know, under state regulation we had some of the same variations you\u2019re talking about Mark.  Whether, was it in small group, etc?  And, you know, we have that ability to analyze and decide; where do we want to play, how are the rules going to work.  This will also create perhaps, you know, if something happens, different interactions with the states.  But I think what you should take comfort in is, we have the ability to move quickly, we\u2019re thinking about the issues.  Of course until you know what the issues are and how they inter relate it\u2019s difficult to try and isolate a single issue and say what\u2019s going on.","But saying that, you know, the mandate itself is a fairly weak mandate, okay, in our minds to begin with because it\u2019s still probably allows a lot of people to buy insurance when they need it.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","All right, thank you that\u2019s helpful.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Rob Pollock","","Morning Chris.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Morning. Question for you on sort of the RFP Process with the Fannie Loans.  Can you comment sort of around premiums charged for the RFP\u2019s maybe relative to some of your existing book of business with them.","Rob Pollock","","We don\u2019t go into specifics, but let me tell you what we can say, Chris, is that Fannie, and I think this probably relates, you know, to the growing seriously delinquent loans. They\u2019re focused on, how can they reduce insurance cost related to that business. And, you know, we think we have solutions, we\u2019ve responded to the RFP.  We think we have ways to deal with that. But we also know we have to work it in conjunction with our Service and Partners, and we\u2019re going to try and do that.","Mike, I know that, you know, you probably have some of the numbers that can shape what that looks like?","Mike Peninger","","Yes, I just reminded Chris that we\u2019ve talked about the loans that we can track the investor codes on our systems, most of them, about a third, we think we have about 80 million Fannie loans that we\u2019re tracking.","Rob Pollock","","Remember when they moved to ROE status, Chris, then you know, Fannie self-insures that business.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. Do you know the timetable in terms of when you expect to hear back from them?","Rob Pollock","","Again, I think that we\u2019ve had some dialogues. You know, I think that you\u2019ve got probably the servicer\u2019s weighing in on some of this as well, because this has an impact on, you know, they want to make sure they\u2019re fulfilling servicing requirements that are, you know, are discussions that they have with Fannie themselves. But, in all of this, remember we got about a 1% placement rate on those loans that are out with Fannie, and we\u2019ve got some solutions that, you know, require that different parties work together.  I think they were the original RFP, they were looking for something this summer.  You know, our best guess is going to take a little longer than that, but we don\u2019t know.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners"," ","In terms of Capital Management, you know, historically you haven\u2019t been active in the market during hurricane season, but last year you diverted from that a bit. You, know Chris just gave us some pretty good collar around thinking about the reinsurance program coming up. So, you know, as you think about that, how does that impact your decision around share repurchases, and would you expect to be active during this one season?","Rob Pollock","","Well Chris, I think our goal is to be in the market consistently, and in the past we\u2019ve dialed back, because taking a conservative approach as it relates to when we move into wind season.  I think that we\u2019ll calibrate every quarter, that\u2019s been the policy over the last nine quarters.  I think one of the things that we calibrate around is the CAT Program, which we\u2019ll have a better feel for the next month or so.  But, I think the goal would be, you know, even adjusting for what we like to think of as a \u201cseasonal buffer\u201d so additional capital held back as we move into wind season, I think our goal would be to be in the market consistently throughout the entire year.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay.  So should we take the consistency meaning, you know, roughly the level of share repurchases you\u2019ve had in 1Q? Or just meaning you\u2019ll consistently have some activity in a quarter?","Rob Pollock","","I think, again, consistent activity throughout the entire year.  What I would discourage you from doing is attempting to extrapolate quarterly activity, but yearly look at the body of work if you will.  And when you start to think about the last two years of purchase, the last nine quarters and if you include April as well, 32 million shares, and almost 1.2 billion dollars.  So, the way I think about it, is over the course of time, we will after applying our Capital Management Priorities, we will return capital to shareholders. And with the price as attractive as it is to us now on the percentage of book, we feel that capital deployment through share repurchases is a prudent approach.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll go back in the queue.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James and Associates.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","","Good morning everybody.","Rob Pollock","","Hey Steven, how are you doing?","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","","I got a few, mostly quickies, just on Specialty Property loss ratio for the quarter, very good, obviously not CAT losses.  Are we also looking at a situation where call it large weather events that generally happen, but might not be considered cats didn't happen either because of the mild weather?","Rob Pollock","","Yes, I think we had a real mild winter and we've had some of those in the past and then we've had some more severe ones and I think that's what causes the variation Steven.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","","Okay, and then just looking at the guidance for the loss ratio and the expense ratio moving higher obviously versus last year ex CATs is this a function of captures that market possibly driving margin down a little bit?","Rob Pollock","","I think it's really a function of what we saw the products changing a little bit, which would be gee we thought placement rates might start to go down a little bit, we'd have a little bit more of our other business, the multi-family housing, which includes the renters and sure deposit in it. But it was really predicated on their being lender placement rates coming down a little bit Steven.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","","Okay, great.  And then on American Family, are they currently writing business for somebody else in the health market?","Rob Pollock","","I believe that they have had a relationship, but I don't know who it is Steven.  ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","","Okay, so you don't know how much they were writing begin with?","Rob Pollock","","I don't, but they're in I think 14 or 15 states and they have written some small group insurance with us for a number of years.  ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","","Okay, and then just one last one.  I'm interested in the comment in regards to the Social Security adjudication.  I'm very interested in that.  You know, a while ago I guess the New York Times had an article about some guy in Kentucky who never saw a disability case that he didn't like.  I'm sure you remember that.  ","Rob Pollock","","Yes, we do.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","","Is this a response to that?  Is this a potential response to budget pressure?  What do you think is driving this?","Rob Pollock","","Yes, I think there could be lots of reasons, I think what we can observe Steven is just that it's taking Social Security a longer time to come to decisions.  And whether that's because they're taking a different approach or just sheer volume of applications or whatever, the fact is the way reserves in disability, a least the way our disability reserves is we sort of assume the longer time it takes the lower the probability that a claimant is going to get Social Security.  And if they get Social Security of course that offsets our liability.  So the fact that these things are taking longer, what it's hard to tell because you just need so much data to be credible in disability, is whether we're going to change the [Inaudible] the rate at which social security approval is going to change.  And it's going to take more time to see that, but in the meantime that longer timeframe actually feeds into our reserves a little bit.  So that's the impact we mentioned.  ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","","That's because you're getting a couple of months extra where you're not getting the offset?","Rob Pollock","","I would say it's just a little different than that.  Mike pointed out that our reserves assume we're not going to get the offset.  If we get it then that'll come back as a positive, but right now we're assuming we're not going to get it on some of those claims.  ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","","Okay great, thanks guys.  ","Operator","","Our next question comes from Jeff Schuman with KBW.  ","Rob Pollock","","Good morning Jeff.","Jeffery Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Good morning, thank you.  One follow up.  I didn't quite follow on the California rate review why is only half the premium subject to weight review?","Rob Pollock","","We write a variety of different kinds of business and so that\u2019s just the portion of it.  you know, we have different legal entities and in our California businesses just half of it is sort of what's associated with the products California is looking at.  So think about our renters business, that\u2019s something that's under review or a manufactured housing could or couldn't be, so it's the business that we filed for a rate change on.  ","Jeffery Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Okay, that's helpful.  Thanks.  And then back on the Fannie RFP can you give us a little more, a better sense of what that whole process looks like?  Is it mostly a discussion between Fannie and the traditional sources of capacity and loan tracking or is this a much broader, outside of the box process that could involve other sources of capacity and other solutions?","Rob Pollock","","Well again, I can't comment on the later because I just don\u2019t know because they put out an RFP and I guess my nephew could have bid on it Jeff and I don't know what he would have said.  But if you think about the processes that'll be required to work on this, we think it will require an ability to track and integration with the mortgage servicers who also are performing a number of activities around things.  So we responded it's a comprehensive detailed RFP as you would expect.  That goes into a lot of things and we think we understand what's driven this and we think a lot of it does relate to those seriously delinquent loans.  And if you just think about the fact that were these in an REO status, Fannie would be self-insuring them and these may be some loans that for whatever reason haven't moved to REO yet, you start to understand their rationale behind looking at all of this.  ","Jeffery Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Okay, that's helpful, thanks.  And then over on health, I think the gap loss ratio last year was 74% for the year.  I think it was about 74% this quarter, can you update us on how you think we should kind of conceptually map between the 80% requirement and that gap.  I think at one point you said we're sort of thinking in mid to high 70s, should we think a little lower is compatible with now?  How should we think about that?  ","Rob Pollock","","I think that's kind of a reasonable range still Jeff.  When you think about credibility adjustments you think about some of our business being subject to the MLR and some not, so I think you would get into that kind of middle 70s range to your point.  There's also transition relief, there's changes in credibility, there's just lots of factors that sort of go into that calculation of the MLR.  ","Jeffery Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Okay, so some of the 74 numbers we've seen we should view as being on kind of the favorable end of what we should expect?  Is that fair?","Rob Pollock","","I think it's likely to move up a little from there over time, yes.  ","Jeffery Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Okay.  And then it seems like you've made really good progress on taking the expenses down, the other part of the shift is really trying to get the volumes up, I mean, is it fair that the expense improvements have been sufficient, that maybe it takes a little bit of pressure on your requirements to scale up aggressively?  Or do you still need to scale up quite aggressively do you think?  And if that's the case you maybe need to shift back and spend a little more money on marketing.  ","Rob Pollock","","Yes, good questions.  I guess where I'd start is if you look at our emphasis on our health access products we are pleased with the fact that we're writing quite a bit of that business.  But remember it's at a lower premium rate and is replacing higher premium major medical coverages.  So we want to write more of that health access business.  We also feel that the Aetna relationship, which we're rally expecting to kick in, in the second half of the year, will help us in that individual major medical side.  Wow, that was a mouthful.  And the point is, we spent a lot of time during the 1st quarter on implementation, just putting that in place, which was no small task.  So we think that we're well positioned with that and the American Family deal to see our new business pick up in the 2nd half of the year.  And again, in all of this we're looking focus on meeting that affordability need of our consumers.  But I think we have talked and I think you're picking up, thinking about it like we are Jeff, is that we need both.  We've done a lot of great work as you've said on expenses, we've got some more to do that and most of that continues to be sort of in the infrastructure, and then we've got a basis that we can leverage some of our distribution things.  And we need to do both of those things.  We need to continue to work on the expense side and with Aetna and American Family and our other distribution partners to ramp up the sales too.  ","Jeffery Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Okay, that's it for me, thanks a lot.  ","Operator","","And our next question comes from Mark Hughes with Suntrust.  ","Rob Pollock ","","Good morning, Mark. ","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","","Good morning.  On the Healthcare Reform, if the entire thing were to get tossed, how much change has there been at state-level regulation, which is to say, you know, how much could you go back to your former way of operating the business if the Supreme Court throws out the whole thing, or are there other changes, regulations at the state level, perhaps, that are \u2013 would still impact your business going forward?  ","Rob Pollock","","Well, you know, again, the states have involvement in the process.  I think they would adapt their thinking about things a little bit and we have good relationships with the insurance departments in the states we operate.  ","So you know, again, we\u2019re sitting down and trying to analyse things, but it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s so many variables involved in all of this, Mark,  it\u2019s very difficult to be able to figure out exactly which pieces are going to be impacted.  You brought that they just say, throw out the whole thing.  I don\u2019t think we put a high likelihood on that.  It could, but I don\u2019t think we put a high likelihood on that.  But regardless, we have a strategy we think will work either way and can be quickly adapted because the cornerstone of all of it is affordability and the products we\u2019ve designed that meet what consumers want.  ","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","On disability, how much longer is that claims process, if you can say?  And then how important is that to your recoveries, or what proportion of your recoveries come from those Social Security approvals?  ","Rob Pollock","","Yes, I can\u2019t give you a specific number on, like number of months.  All I can say, Mark, is we\u2019re just seeing it take longer and that just sort of complicates the challenge of this analyzing the business and things like that.  You know, the fundamental issue is, we need to get people, whether they get Social Security or not, we need to get them back to work.  And then the challenge being economic environment, that\u2019s just proving harder than it has been sort of by our historic standards.  ","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","Is that a smaller piece of your recoveries?  Is it 20%, is it bigger? ","Rob Pollock","","Yes, so it\u2019s hard without having all those specifics.  So let\u2019s just take a very simple example, Mark.  Let\u2019s assume that in the first year, 70% of our claims we assume are going to get Social Security, and after the first year and between years one and two, a quarter of them are going to get a Social Security recovery.  I\u2019m totally making these numbers up.  And after two years, nobody is going to get one.  Okay?  Now, if you think about the reserves that Mike mentioned, in that first year we set up a gross reserve, but assumed that we\u2019re going to get 70% of that reserve paid for by the reimbursement, not perfect, but if we were paying at the Social Security level.  And you start looking at what happens as the payments are slowed, you can see that we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re increasing our reserves as a result.  ","Now, if it turns out we actually get the money back, then we\u2019re going to have a positive flow in our financial statements.  But that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on right now.  ","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust","Right.  Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.  ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Good morning. ","Rob Pollock ","","Good morning. ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Good morning, Rob.  You know, Rob, I\u2019m curious about the pace of buyback in the first quarter.  I think historically this tends to be one of your bigger buyback quarters, historically.  You know, is there anything that we should read into the pace of 1Q buybacks?  And then also relatedly, could you discuss your expectations for a new buyback authorization since it seems like the remaining amount on your current authorization is getting somewhat low?  ","Rob Pollock","","Sure.  So first, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the quarterly buyback.  I think Chris covered that in some detail.  I like the term you used, you have to look at the body of our work as opposed to looking at a particular point in time.  I know you guys have to do that, but the answer is, don\u2019t read anything into it.  Our capital deployment strategy is consistent with what it\u2019s always been and I think both Mike and Chris mentioned, we think our shares are attractively priced.  I think you\u2019ll see that reflected moving forward in whatever we do with our buybacks.  ","You know, I forgot the second part of your question. ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Authorization. ","Rob Pollock ","","You know, that\u2019s a board action, John, so you know, the \u2013 it\u2019s something we talk about regularly with the Board.  We also talk to them annually about our dividend and Chris, do you want to\u2026 ","Chris Pagano","","Yes, John, just, you know, again, as Rob mentioned, I don\u2019t think it makes sense to speculate on anything that requires Board action.  But what I can tell you is we have regular dialog with the Board on both the share repurchase and our dividend policy and we have support from the Board in alignment on the approach that we\u2019ve been taking.  ","So again\u2026","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay.  Yeah, that\u2019s fair enough.  I understand you don\u2019t want to get out in front of the Board.  Rob, is anything changed on the M&A outlook?  I mean, you know, obviously a lot of financial companies out there are under some stress, particularly overseas, you know, a lot of the kinds of things that I think you guys would have interest in are likely smaller pieces of bigger companies that may or may not be viewed as core.  ","Rob Pollock","","Yes. ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","So I\u2019m just wondering if anything has changed on the M&A outlook? ","Rob Pollock","","You know, we\u2019re continuing to look at things.  We\u2019re looking at lots of things, John.  Remember, as well that things have to hit our hurdle rates to buy.  We\u2019ve got to be able to buy in excess of our cost capital.  We said we\u2019re likely to buy things that are smaller.  I think you\u2019re referring to things that could be tuck-in acquisitions, we\u2019d love to do tuck-in acquisitions.  I would say right now, the number one thing available in the market is something we\u2019re not too interested in, which is variable profit stuff.  There\u2019s a fair amount of it and we\u2019re not going to be interested in that.  ","But you know, if you look at our record, the sure deposit acquisition, there\u2019re likely to be smaller things that are nichey and fit in with what we want to do.  And if we can find the tuck-in at \u2013 that is something that\u2019s not in excess of our cost capital, absolutely, we\u2019ll consider it.  ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","I\u2019m very happy to hear no interest in the variable product.  Just \u2013 and then two more quick ones.  What\u2019s the timing of this New York public hearing on the lender place business? ","Rob Pollock ","","Yeah, I think it\u2019s in Mid-May. ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay.  And then what\u2019s the \u2013 you know, what\u2019s their current assessment, Rob, of the \u2013 I guess what you\u2019re calling the mobile business now?  You know, what we used to think of as wireless, what\u2019s your current status of how that business is performing; clients up, you know, new client opportunities, competitive situations, that sort of thing? ","Rob Pollock ","","Yes, we\u2019ve, you know, we\u2019ve got a lot of activity in the area.  Again, this is an area we like a lot because we\u2019ve mentioned that there\u2019s new business and new profit pools emerging all the time.  This is a business that is already exceeding our ROE targets.  We\u2019ve mentioned a few of the, you know, the Sprint deal on \u2013 that we did with them on tablets, a small deal but a huge learning opportunity for us in terms of where things might go.  You know, we\u2019ve got Telephonica, which you know, we\u2019ve been running hard at the implementation for, you know, a number of quarters and feel good about that.  This is now going to give us the ability to tap some new ideas, in particular, the prepaid market.  ","So you know, we feel good about that market and we think it\u2019s going to be continue to grow moving forward, and it\u2019s a big part of where we expect to see growth. ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thanks.  And then the last quick one, so I get it, that a lot can change on the Healthcare Reform, particularly with the Supreme Court reviewing it.  But if we just assume that the Healthcare Reform as it stands today, remains in place, you know, what\u2019s your best guess currently on the timing for getting to that 4% after-tax margin target? ","Rob Pollock ","","I think it\u2019s, the way we\u2019ve characterized it in the past, is we have to have all the Healthcare reform issues, which are coming in over the years, John, we have to deal with all those.  I would suspect that 2014 timeframe, things are fully implemented.  I\u2019d look toward the later part of the year there for that to happen.  Again, the big key is that we have success with our affordable products in the health access portfolio and the supplemental products there, which again, are preforming well, but we\u2019ve got to write more of that as well.  ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thank you very much.  I appreciate it. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James and Associates.  ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Hey, again.  Just a few more if I may.  Rob, can you maybe explain something I\u2019m not getting.  And I saw the AETNA when it happened.  You get to use their facilities, their network.  I mean, that\u2019s nice, that\u2019s great, that you have this, but how does that feed customers to you? ","Rob Pollock","","Well, only, you know, we can then work their tier one discounts into the pricing of our major medical products.  That has been an inhibitor for us in this business for a long time because it\u2019s put us at a, you know, cost of goods sold disadvantage because we have to charge more.  ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Okay, got it.  And then just one more follow-up on the Social Security thing.  The way you described it to Mark, I think it was great.  Is there \u2013 are you saying that \u2013 okay, so let\u2019s say we\u2019re in year two here and you get an approval that that is going to be retroactive back to the start of the claim? ","Rob Pollock","","Yes.  That\u2019s exactly right.  You\u2019re thinking about it the right way, Steven.  ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Okay, great.  That\u2019s what I wanted to make sure.  Thank you. ","Rob Pollock ","","Sure.  Thanks for joining us today.  We look forward to updating you on our progress on our next quarterly call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Executive Vice President, Chief Communications and Marketing Officer. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi - EVP, Chief Communication and Marketing Officer","Thank you, Jessa, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dziadzio, who joined Assurant last week as our new Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Risk Officer and former CFO.","Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. As noted last quarter, this year we revised the earnings release and the financial supplement to focus on housing and lifestyle. Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments; Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property, and Corporate, as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions, and other variable items.","We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy. On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on those measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurant.com.","We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.","Now I'll turn the call over to Alan.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Overall results were consistent with our outlook, as we continue to execute our multi-year transformation. While earnings were down for the quarter, we believe the steps we are taking to build a more compelling business portfolio supported by our evolution to a more integrated global operating model will enable us to deliver profitable growth long-term.","As outlined at our Investor Day in March, we measure our progress with three key financial metrics; net operating income, operating earnings per deluded share, and operating return on equity. All exclude reportable catastrophe losses, given the inherent volatility of weather.","Through the first six months of 2016, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, decreased 16% to $215 million, primarily due to the expected declines in lender-placed, lower results from legacy business, as well as the loss of the tablet program. Higher tax expenses at corporate also contributed to the decrease.","Operating earnings per deluded share, excluding catastrophe losses, declined 9% to $3.34. Lower earnings were partially offset by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI and catastrophe losses, was 11.9%, in line with 2015. Our fee-based and capital-light businesses comprising connected living, mortgage solutions, and multi-family housing now represent 52% of our revenue and nearly one-third of our earnings.","Our balance sheet remained strong with $725 million of holding company capital as of June 30. So far, through July 22 of this year, we have returned a total of $548 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our intent to return $1.5 billion by the end of 2017.","Let me now share some highlights from the quarter that illustrate our progress in building a stronger Assurant for the future and achieving our longer-term profitability goals. In June, we received final notification from CMS of the 2015 ACA risk mitigation payments, which were near our estimates. This represents another important milestone in winding down our Health operations.","In addition, we were able to dividend $84 million to the holding company during the second quarter. We also received $604 million in dividends related to the sale of Employee Benefits, with more expected later this year and into 2017 as we release capital formally supporting the business. This capital along with cash generated from Solutions and Specialty Property provides us significant flexibility to return capital to shareholders and to invest in attractive businesses where we can outperform.","This quarter, we also took several actions to strengthen our housing and lifestyle offerings. At Solutions, our focus remains on growing earnings and improving margins through a combination of profitable growth and operating efficiencies worldwide. For example, we expanded an existing OEM partnership in Chile and Italy through the introduction of new device upgrade programs. We also launched a program with Vodafone UK to replace mobile phones in as little as four hours of an approved claim. Through innovative products and services such as these, we have broadened our market share and are now protecting more than 31 million devices.","To drive greater efficiency, we also implemented expense management actions at Solutions, primarily focused on our legacy runoff businesses. All of these initiatives, along with steady contributions from our vehicle protection and pre-need offerings, will help us deliver on our commitment to increase net operating income by 10% on average annually over time.","At Specialty Property, we're evolving the lender-placed platform as we look to enhance our market-leading position. The investments we've made to better serve homeowners and clients together with our continued focus on compliance remain key differentiators. We're pleased to announce that we will start to onboard approximately 700,000 loans later in the third quarter, including the return of a block of loans that was previously transferred to a competitor in 2014. Leveraging our strong position as a trusted advisor in lender-placed, we continue to expand our offerings across the broader mortgage value chain.","Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of American Title, a leader in title and valuation services specifically for home equity lenders. With nearly $50 million of annualized fees, this represents another important extension of our fee-based, capital-light offerings in mortgage solutions. In addition to strengthening our business portfolio, we are realigning our operating model to better support profitable growth.","On July 1, Gene Mergelmeyer moved into his role of Chief Operating Officer, overseeing all of Assurant's global business lines. In the months ahead, we will evolve our organizational structure to deliver greater coordination across our operations and improve execution. We believe this operating model will more efficiently leverage our enterprise scale to create competitive advantage in the key markets we serve. But perhaps the most important outcome of this transformation will be an ability to deliver greater value to our customers and more opportunities for our employees.","Another important step in shaping our enterprise model is the addition of Richard Dziadzio, who joined Assurant last week as CFO and Treasurer. Richard is an accomplished leader, holding a number of key finance positions in leading global insurance organizations over the past 22 years. His expertise will be critical in enhancing the ways in which finance supports the business while at the same time helping us to deliver on our broader strategic objectives. He will build on Chris Pagano's strong track record by further integrating our global financial operations and executing our capital management strategy.","I know Richard is looking forward to fostering a strong partnership between finance and risk. On behalf of our employees, I'd also like to thank Chris for his leadership and many contributions as CFO. Now, as Chris moves into the Chief Risk Officer role, he will strengthen our robust risk management framework even more.","We've made tremendous progress executing our transformation in the first half of the year. Our focus for the balance of 2016 will be on substantially concluding the wind-down of Health, implementing a more integrated operating structure, and positioning Assurant for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.","Before Chris reviews our second quarter results in greater detail, I'll ask Richard to share some thoughts on what's ahead. Richard?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & EVP","Thanks, Alan. I'm excited to join Assurant, as we transform the company to deliver on our shared aspirations of outperformance. I'm encouraged by our fundamentals and the continued momentum of our core businesses. I believe, as we further align our operations, we can deliver even greater value to our customers, employees and shareholders. I also view our strong cash flow generation and disciplined approach to capital management as key differentiators. We will continue to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends while also investing in specialty businesses to strengthen our capabilities, offerings and distribution channels.","In the next several months, I will focus on aligning the finance team with our new global operating model to support growth in housing and lifestyle and our work to evolve our financial reporting framework. Since joining Assurant last week, I received strong support from Alan, Chris and the senior leadership team, as well as the entire finance organization. In the near-term, I will spend time listening to understand where we're strong while continuing to enhance our process and approach. During this period, I will have the opportunity to visit with many of you, and I look forward to it.","With that, I will turn the call over to Chris to review the quarter in more detail.","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","Thanks, Richard. I'm glad to have you on board and I look forward to working together to support Assurant's long-term strategic and financial objectives.","Turning to the quarter, Solutions results included $10 million of higher one-time tax benefits year-over-year. Excluding these items, earnings decreased by $9 million to $43 million. This expected decline was driven by lower production from North American retailers and the impact of the loss of the tablet program. We also incurred $2.4 million of severance-related costs, as we continued to streamline non-growth operations.","Total revenue at Solutions grew 3% from the prior period due to increased covered mobile devices and double-digit growth in vehicle service contracts. Our auto business benefited from strong U.S. vehicle sales and a one-time contribution from a client. This was partially offset by declines in certain North American retailers, the impact of the loss of the tablet program, and foreign exchange volatility, particularly in Argentina.","While earnings at Solutions were down for the first half of the year, performance was consistent with our outlook. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect net operating income to increase. Profitability will be driven by savings from expense initiatives, improved international profitability, and a ramp-up in new mobile programs toward the end of the year.","At Specialty Property, earnings decreased year-over-year by $31 million to $57 million. $10 million of the decline was attributable to higher catastrophe losses and the remainder reflects the expected normalization of lender-placed, lower real estate owned policies, and the impact from the previous loss of client business.","The combined ratio for the risk-based lender-placed and manufactured housing lines of business increased 490 basis points to 87.3%. This was the result of severe flooding and hailstorms in Texas as well as lower lender-placed revenue. The fee-based, capital-light offerings generated a pre-tax margin of 11.2%, 250 basis points lower than the prior year related to additional expenses to support growth in our mortgage valuation business.","Overall, net earned premiums and fees at Specialty Property decreased 12%, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates for lender-placed as well as lower real estate owned policies. We did, however, see continued expansion in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. Multi-family housing revenue increased over 11% from growth in our affinity channels and property management network. Mortgage solutions fee income grew 4% with increases in property preservation and default appraisals.","The catastrophe activity in the quarter served as an important reminder of the need for comprehensive coverage. In June, we finalized our 2016 catastrophe reinsurance program, purchasing $1.4 billion of coverage on attractive terms. We also lowered our U.S. retention to $125 million, a decrease of nearly 20%, mainly due to declining exposure.","Our outlook for the segment is unchanged. We continue to expect lower revenue and profits for 2016, reflecting the normalization of lender-placed. Expense efficiencies and growth in targeted areas will partially offset the declines. Please note that the new block of loans Alan referenced has a higher placement rate than our overall average, but it will transfer to Assurant at renewal and therefore isn't expected to generate much premium until 2017.","Turning to Health runoff operations, the segment reported a net loss of $5 million, slightly better than expected. A reduction in estimated recoverables for the 2015 risk mitigation programs was partially offset by more favorable claims development and a pharmacy rebate. Results also included $4 million in severance-related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves. The wind-down of Health is moving along as planned, and we believe the risk for volatility in claims development is relatively low.","In June, we received final notice from CMS regarding risk mitigation payments for 2015 ACA policies. The final amount, including a lower risk adjustment payment, is reflected in our second quarter financials. We have already received $66 million in reinsurance payments this year. And as of June 30, around $419 million of net receivables remain on our balance sheet. CMS expects to remit payments for these outstanding balances starting in the third quarter.","Year-to-date, we've taken $149 million in dividends from Health. Consistent with initial estimates, we expect the holding company to receive another $325 million later this year, subject to regulatory approval and receipt of the 2015 risk mitigation payments.","Moving to Corporate, the loss for the quarter increased $10 million to $19 million primarily due to higher taxes, which will reverse during the remainder of the year. For full year 2016, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We are working to integrate support functions and ultimately eliminate residual expenses from Employee Benefits, which will create a more efficient operating model for the future.","Moving to capital, we ended the second quarter with $475 million in deployable capital. In addition to the $688 million of dividends from the sale of Employee Benefits and wind down of Health, we received $86 million from Solutions and Specialty Property during the quarter. Our strong cash flow generation and receipt of the Employee Benefits proceeds at the holding company during the quarter allowed us to repay the $250 million of short-term financing secured earlier in the year, returned $226 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, invest $9 million in mobile technology capabilities, and set aside $45 million for the July 1 closing of American Title.","Through July 22, we bought an additional 363,000 shares, bringing the total shares repurchased year-to-date to just over 6 million. Overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy to ensure long-term profitable growth in housing and lifestyle.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Seth.","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","Good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the call \u2013 the question. I would like to ask about the Solutions earnings and just maybe try to get a little bit more granularity, as we head into the back half of the year on the pickup you expected. So now that we're actually there in the back half of the year, perhaps you could give us a little bit of details on the emergence of these programs that should contribute to revenue and earnings as well as the scale of the contribution we should see.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Seth, maybe I'll start with this \u2013 little bit of commentary on what we're trying to do overall this year, and then I'll ask Chris to elaborate on that question. We've thought about 2016 very much as a transition year, as we set up Assurant for long-term profitable growth. And we've really been focused on three things. One is getting our portfolio really focused on the market-leading positions we have in Solutions and in Property, and we feel very good about the progress with the proceeds coming up from Employee Benefits. As you heard Chris say and I said, Health is now effectively on track to the wind-down. And we've been continuing to make selective investments to really strengthen our position, as we did this quarter with American Title or as we're about to do in July.","The second thing we've really been focused on is getting to a more kind of agile, efficient operating model. And that includes things like moving to the Chief Operating Officer structure, which really sets up opportunities for us to go after, improving the coordination across our products and improving the kind of efficiency of our operations. And we've brought on board significant outside talent; Ajay Waghray joining us a few months ago as the Chief Technology Officer, Richard joining us as the CFO.","And the third thing we've really been focused on is deploying capital. And you see in our commitment to return $1.5 billion over the couple of years and deploy it. So we feel \u2013 yes, transition year, we've said we expect earnings overall to be down, not true in Solutions, but earnings overall to be down. And we feel like the progress is well underway.","But with that said, Chris, you want to talk about Solutions in the second half?","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","Sure. Seth, so \u2013 again, we don't comment on specific clients, but what I can tell you around the mobile business and what we're looking at for the second half is first half was weaker. But as expected, we do think that we're still comfortable with our expectations or our outlook that the second half of the year will be better than the first half. So, second half 2016 better than first half 2016. And that full year 2016 will be higher than full year 2015. And then of course, longer term, we do view the 10% average annual NOI growth as an achievable target.","So in terms of specifics around, we did take some actions on expenses. We'll start to see the benefit in the second half. The other thing to keep in mind that the revenue growth will potentially be muted within Solutions, but think about a rotation that's going on, the runoff of the big-box retailers and the non-growth credit business, for example, being offset by growth in the higher margin fee-based business in particular on the mobile side.","So you combine this rotation to higher margin product with expense initiatives, we think you're going to receive \u2013 while you may not see revenue growth, you're going to see growth in the bottom line. And that's what we're thinking for the second half.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So when you talk about the new programs rolling on, are these the extended OEM program in Chile and the Vodafone program you commented or are there sort of above and beyond some of the other new programs that are rolling on?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think the important context is whenever we sign a new program, it takes some time to ramp in. So really what we're talking about here are some of the things we announced late last year, really kicking in. We announced, for example, partnerships with Google and eBay and a few others. Those are now ramping into the P&L. And then we talked about the significant expansion of programs to some of our prior clients and continuing clients that also really tick in in the second half. But the things we announced today will really be more significant when you get into 2017.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Mike.","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","Hey, Mike.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question, as we look at the fee-based sources of income in property in the quarter, and obviously 7% growth in that line is pretty nice, but a little bit slower than the overall long-term targets of 8% to 12% across both multi-family and mortgage solutions. I think the roll-on of the American Title acquisition will obviously sort of distort these revenue growth numbers going forward. But could you give us an update on what you are seeing across maybe both of them and more specifically on the mortgage solutions that give you long-term confidence in the organic growth rates there?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. If we go back to what we said at Investor Day, we mentioned that longer-term we see 10%, 12% type growth rates across those lines of business. And we \u2013 again, you have some volatility quarter-to-quarter. We felt good about the progress of multi-family. We continue to rapidly outgrow the market. And then in mortgage solutions, you have some typical fluctuations as we ramp in with the new client or things shift around a little bit in the marketplace just on activity in the mortgage market, but no change in our perspective. We are gaining share and are continuing to gain share.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. As we think about American Title, can you give us a sense of sort of what the margins are that you are targeting in there? Is that in line with the capital-light pre-tax margin targets of 15% to 20% for that segment?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then just one more if I could. You mentioned the loan program, 700,000 loans rolling on. Anything that you are seeing in the competitive marketplace? Obviously there's been some acquisition that \u2013 in the marketplace that changes the dynamics for Assurant going forward.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So if you think about the lender-placed homeowners business, it has been and remains a very competitive marketplace. We have strong competitors that we have to compete with on a regular basis for every piece of business. The good news, though, is we have the industry-leading platform and capabilities in customer service, and we continue to invest in those. And yes, we'll occasionally lose pieces of business, but more often than not, we win pieces of business. And having this client return I think is just a testament to the quality of our operation and the value we deliver for our clients and for their consumers.","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","And just maybe \u2013 just another comment or two on that portfolio. So, as a reminder, where it's going to start the end of the quarter, we're going to incur some costs during the \u2013 preparing for it to onboard the loans. The loans will transfer on renewal. So it's going to take four quarters for the full letter cycle and all these loans to finally be on the portfolio. So this will be a 2017 event from a premium and profit standpoint. But again, as Alan mentioned, just really an indication of the platform and the quality of the operation at Specialty Property.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Jimmy.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. So, first, just similar to the previous question, I just had \u2013 wanted to follow up on your confidence in pickup in Solutions revenue in the second half. I think now you're implying that most of the growth is going to come late in the year, so maybe the fourth quarter. But has anything changed in terms of your views of that business now versus maybe three, four months ago? And just in terms of \u2013 if you could give us some detail on the contracts that are going to drive the expected pickup; have you already signed those or are those relationships that you're expecting to sign as you go through the year?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the first most important thing, Jimmy, is nothing has changed. Our view on Solutions has been consistent and remains consistent. As we've said, we expect earnings to improve in the second half of the year relative to the first half. And as Chris said, we still fully expect full year earnings to beat 2015 full year earnings. And in terms of what's going to drive it, everything is in place. These are all programs that have started and are ramping. So, nothing new needs to happen for those other than they need to develop as we anticipate they'll develop. But they're on track, and we feel very good.","I don't know, Chris, if you have anything to that?","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","No, I guess I just want to maybe just emphasize the fact that this rotation in the mix shift will produce the bottom line profitability. So, while there may not be significant revenue growth in aggregate, you're going to see the runoff in the retailers and the non-growth business offset by growth in the fee-based higher margin business.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And could you give us some color on the slowdown in the mobile business this quarter on a sequential basis? Obviously, year-over-year the tablet contract affected it, but just a slowdown versus the first quarter.","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","Yeah. Just in general, again, the tablet was a main driver there. It was just some of the programs were \u2013 just the volumes on the programs weren't where we had anticipated \u2013 where they had been in the past. There was a little bit of a lower mobile profit in Europe, but again, we're taking actions to address that and we feel very good about the second half.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then lastly on share buybacks, they were lower than you had in the first quarter. And given your capital position and your free cash flow generation, I would have thought that you would have been able to keep up a similar pace or maybe even accelerate little bit. So just some color on that. And would you expect like a normal year when you slow down buybacks in the third quarter because of potential cat activity? Would you expect the same to happen this year as well?","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","Yeah. So I think the goal for us and \u2013 is to be consistent with years past. We still think the shares are attractively priced. We bought back 6 million-plus shares through this 22 of July, which is almost 10% on the float. So we feel good about the volumes. The line of \u2013 the deployable capital at the end of the quarter and our line of sight on sources of capital and particularly the dividends from Health and some of the capital release from benefits, which we're expecting in the second half, gives us a lot of flexibility. And years past, when we've typically said we'll need to slow down as we go into cat season, I think we've got ample flexibility to continue to buy consistently through the second half.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","Hey, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hello.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","The margin for the fee-based business within Specialty Property, you talked about the \u2013 some additional investments to support growth this quarter. Are you going to have the same thing next quarter? Should we anticipate margins steadied up in Q3?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Mark, we don't really give quarter-to-quarter type guidance. There is normal volatility, but nothing has changed in where we think long-term those margins are, which is 15% to 20%. And we're taking action to ensure that we achieve that over time. So, nothing's really changed. What happens quarter-to-quarter there is normal volatility.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got you. And then the global vehicle protection, I think you had suggested the good growth, but then also one-time bump. Can you quantify that one-time contribution?","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","Sure. So, if you \u2013 so that was about $19 million or $20 million in the quarter. So if you back that out year-over-year, that's not the 35% but a 22% growth. And then quarter-on-quarter, not the 18.5% but I think the number is 7%. So, still very good growth in the core business even after you back out the one-time.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Seth.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just a couple of detailed questions. First on Health, you have $325 million remaining to be dividended up this year as per your target, and you also have $420 million remaining on ACA recoverables. Does that suggest that there is about $100 million residual that could be sent upstream in 2017 and beyond or am I thinking about that wrong?","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","I don't know that the math is that simple. Health is still an ongoing operation. There are expenses and so on. We do think there'll be some capital that we'll be able to get out of the business as it completely winds down, but not the $100 million that you're suggesting there.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Seth, just one other comment on Health. As you all see in the market, Health remains a very challenged sector and very challenged industry. I think the very good news for us is we are effectively done at this point. There's still a little bit of volatility that could happen but not a lot. We're really into the final chapter of the wind-down at this point.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then on Solutions, just in terms of the reiterating guidance for earnings to be at a greater level than 2015, if we exclude the $18 million tax benefit, does that guidance still hold true?","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","Yes, it does.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning again. The \u2013 any update on your eventual outlook for the placement rate within Specialty Property to be 1.8% to 2.1%? Anything in the market that you're seeing in terms of phase or kind of absolute level of delinquencies, et cetera, that give you a reason to change the outlook there or change it a little bit?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not at all. I think the pace of normalization is continuing. As you recall, years past, it took a while to get going, but the last couple of years, it's been proceeding pretty much as we've been projecting and we don't see anything overall in the market. Now, again, as we on-board new loans that have a higher placement rate, you may see some natural kind of bumps in that, but longer term, that 1.8% to 2.1% remains our perspective on the placement rate.","Christopher J. Pagano - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer","Yeah. And I would also point out, and when you go back to Investor Day, Mark, we did also talk about the REO volume as a percent of gross-written trending lower as a result of the normalization too. So you're seeing that trend as well going from 19% a year ago,15% this quarter, and with our long-term outlook being 10% of gross written. So, unambiguous normalization trends are in place at this point.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for participating in today's call. We look forward to updating you on our progress in October. And as always, you can reach out to Suzanne Shepherd and Jisoo Suh with any follow-up questions. Thank you all very much.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. ","We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. On May 31, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group, or TWG. As of June 1, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results and the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March as well as related costs. ","Dividends on the preferred stock are also an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. For the period between March and closing, these financing costs were reflected only in our GAAP net income and therefore, not part of net operating income. In addition, last week, we closed the sale of our mortgage solutions business. While our second quarter 2018 results include the operating results in mortgage solutions, given the disposition, the associated assets and liabilities were held for sale with the resulting net loss of $34 million reflected in consolidated net income. Starting August 1, mortgage solutions results will no longer be included in operating results. ","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports. During today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com. ","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Results reflected strong organic growth in both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle. Initial contributions from The Warranty Group acquisition as well as the benefit from the lower effective U.S. tax rate. ","In May, we closed the acquisition of TWG and welcomed nearly 1,500 new colleagues to Assurant. Our global planning efforts during the months leading up to the close allowed us to hit the ground running on day 1... Relying on our principal of best of the best, we are now bringing together our organizations, leveraging the deep talent, processes and technology across our combined companies. Conversations with our clients also continue and feedback remains favorable. ","To capitalize on growth opportunities and emerging market trends, we've rebranded our vehicle business, now known as Global Automotive, under new leadership. We have dedicated leadership for each of our primary auto distribution channels as well as deeper expertise to drive innovation as we look to deliver new offerings to clients and consumers worldwide. ","We've also integrated TWG's extended service contract business within Connected Living with the growing focus of building our capabilities around the connected home. And we've realigned our legacy credit business, now named Financial Services, to pursue emerging opportunities in the banking sector. ","Globally, the acquisition meaningfully expands our business outside the U.S., increasing our total international annual revenues by 50%. We've also added infrastructure across Asia Pacific where we see some of our greatest opportunities, particularly around mobile. We have refined our view of operating synergies and are starting to realize these benefits. In addition, our business leaders are now pursuing potential revenue synergies, which provide upside to our original acquisition thesis. ","Overall, we remain confident in the growth opportunities ahead with The Warranty Group and more broadly, across our lifestyle and housing businesses. ","Let me share some of the highlights from the quarter. Starting with Global Lifestyle, the segment posted very strong results for the quarter. While this included some onetime benefits, they illustrate momentum across Connected Living and Global Automotive. ","Our recently launched mobile programs continued to thrive from strong market success, particularly in Japan, which is the second largest postpaid mobile device market. We now protect 44 million covered mobile devices worldwide, and in Global Automotive, we are the market leader protecting nearly 47 million vehicles. ","Overall, we see significant opportunity to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connective lifestyle of consumers. ","Turning to Global Housing. The segment also posted solid results, driven by multifamily housing earnings and revenue growth and favorable loss experience in lender-placed. ","During the quarter, we finalized our $1.3 billion reinsurance program for 2018. We now protect more than 2.9 million homeowners and renters in the U.S. and Latin America against severe weather and other hazards. This coverage represents a projected profitable maximum loss of a roughly 1 in 170-year event storm. So the likelihood of us exceeding the total coverage for 1 single event is significantly less than 1%. At the same time, we were able to lower our net loss prevent retention to $120 million as we continue to decrease the potential earnings volatility from cat losses. ","As part of our June announcement, we also shared several new metrics to further illustrate the strength of our program, including a review of historical losses and examples for how the 2018 program would work under various storm scenarios. We believe our continued commitment to excellence in risk management will again serve us well as we move through hurricane season. ","As exemplified by our cat program, protecting and servicing our policyholders is core to what we do each and every day. We were pleased to be recognized by 2 of our key lender-placed clients as one of their best vendors for delivering a superior customer experience. We also believe that in order to sustain this advantage, we must continue to invest, including in an ongoing enhancements to our processes and systems. Our work on our single-processing platform continues, and we expect to migrate another important client in the coming months. This new platform will generate significant cost savings and help deliver a better customer experience. ","With nearly 1.9 million insured renters, our multifamily housing business continues to generate both strong revenue and earnings growth. This quarter, we rolled out additional enhancements to our renters platform, which makes it easier to engage with our property management companies and their renters. This is yet another example of how we were investing to improve our customer experience and sustain our market-leading position. ","As part of our ongoing portfolio management efforts, we conducted a comprehensive strategic and financial assessment in mortgage solutions and decided to sell this business. One of the key criteria we used to evaluate our businesses is the ability to be market leaders. Despite some initial success, we did not see a long-term path to a leadership position for mortgage solutions. ","Last week, we closed on the sale to Xome Holdings for $35 million in cash with potential future payments based on performance. We believe Xome will be a better owner of this business, given its focus and committed resources in the space. The sale will allow us to concentrate on our core housing business as well as deploy greater resources to build out offerings in areas, such as the rental economy and the connected home. I'd like to thank the mortgage solutions team for their dedication and hard work on behalf of our clients, and I wish them the best as part of Xome. ","Turning to our financial results. We currently measure our success against 3 key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. Beginning in June, these metrics now include results for TWG and related acquisition financing. ","For the first 6 months of the year, Assurant's net operating income increased by $39 million or 20% year-over-year to $236 million, driven by strong organic growth in the business, a lower effective tax rate and initial contributions from TWG. ","Operating earnings per diluted share was $4.24, up 21%, largely driven by earnings growth as well as 2017 share repurchases. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11%, up 60 basis points since year-end. ","At the end of June, holding company capital totaled $497 million after returning a total of $36 million in common and preferred dividends. In July, we resumed share repurchase activity given the stronger cash balance following the closing of the acquisition. As always, we are committed to managing our capital prudently and returning excess capital to shareholders.","Turning to our full year 2018 outlook, we've updated it to reflect the acquisition of TWG and the August 1 sale of mortgage solutions. We now expect Assurant net operating earnings excluding reportable catastrophes to increase 20% to 25% from last year. This reflects contributions from TWG, included expected operating synergies, the benefit of a lower effective U.S. tax rate and modest organic growth across our company. ","We also expect strong growth in net operating income per diluted share this year, however, at a slower rate than net operating income. This is mainly due to the effect of the TWG-related share issuance without a full run rate contribution of TWG income and synergies. ","In summary, we're pleased with our performance so far this year. We're confident in our ability to continue to expand earnings and cash flow long term. Our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified earnings. This allows us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term. ","I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our second quarter 2018 results and updated segment outlook in greater detail. Richard?","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing where net operating income for the second quarter totaled $73 million, a $16 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate accounted for $11 million of the increase, as only a small amount of the tax savings was reinvested into the business in the quarter. The balance of the increase was due to more favorable noncatastrophe loss experience in lender-placed insurance and growth in multifamily housing. This was partially offset by ongoing declines in lender-placed, reflecting the strength of the housing market. ","Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses improved to 85.7% from 87% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to more favorable noncat loss experience compared to a very active hail and wind season last year. Results also benefited from lower expenses. ","The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings increased to 14.3% from 11.7% in the second quarter of last year, largely reflecting strong growth in multifamily housing as well as expense reductions. Moving to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were down slightly in the second quarter. Given the strength of the overall market, we continued to see reductions in real estate on volumes and lower placement rates in lender-placed. Fee income was impacted by lower client demand in mortgage solutions, primarily in field services and valuations. ","The placement rate, so lender-placed dropped 21 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the first quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall strength of the housing market and a higher mix of low-placement loans. We continue to expect ongoing declines in the placement rate for the balance of 2018, eventually beginning to moderate as we exit the year. Multifamily housing continued to grow, mainly from affinity partners and expansion of our international and other housing products. As noted earlier, while second quarter operating results for Global Housing still includes mortgage solutions, the associated assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale as of June 30, given the plan to sell the business. This resulted in an impairment loss of $34 million, reflected in our consolidated net income. The impact of the final purchase price and any other adjustments as part of the loss on sale of the subsidiary will be recorded in our third quarter financials. ","Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment reported earnings of $68 million for the second quarter compared to $40 million in the prior year period. This included a $5 million benefit from a lower effective tax rate following the passage of U.S. tax reform. In addition, TWG contributed $9.4 million after tax, inclusive of $1 million of realized operating synergies and $1 million of intangible amortization for the month of June. Excluding tax reform and the acquisition, results benefited from the ramp-up of the mobile programs launched last year as well as favorable loss experience in Global Automotive. We also recorded nearly $6 million of onetime contributions in the quarter, which we do not expect to recur. This encompasses $4 million related to a onetime tax benefit and $2 million from the Global Automotive business. Continued declines in Financial Services partially offset that increase. ","Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up 32% or $266 million in the quarter. TWG accounted for $203 million of this increase. Looking more closely at the TWG contribution by line of business, approximately 70% of revenues is included in Global Automotive with 28% in Connected Living and the remainder in Financial Services. ","Organic growth was driven by new mobile programs, including an increase in subscribers and continued growth in vehicle protection offerings. This was partially offset by lower average selling prices for mobile trade-in activity. ","Looking at the segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses improved slightly to 96.6%. Excluding the acquisition, the ratio was unchanged. The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 7.1% in the second quarter or 7.6% excluding TWG. This compares to 6.4% in the prior year period. Overall, the improvement was driven by mobile programs starting 2017 in both Asia and the U.S. The Connected Living margin reflected the legacy TWG mix of business, mainly more sensitive -- more service contracts offerings. We would expect this to lower our reported Connected Living margin in the next few quarters. Overall, we're very pleased by Lifestyle's results for the first half of the year, which exceeded our expectations. ","Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $15 million in net operating income for the quarter, up $2 million year-over-year. This was exclusively due to lower tax rate. Only a modest amount of tax savings was reinvested back into the business in the quarter. ","Revenue in Preneed for the quarter was flat, both in the U.S., including prior period sales and the Final Need product, was offset by lower production in Canada compared to a favorable second quarter 2017. We are encouraged, however, by 8% growth in face sales after several periods of decline. ","At Corporate, the net operating loss was $17 million, a year-over-year increase of $7 million. This was due to higher employee-related expenses and additional technology investments as well as a $2 million adverse impact from the lower effective tax rate. ","Turning to capital, we ended June with $497 million in holding company capital or about $247 million of deployable capital after adjusting for our risk buffer. Dividends from the business totaled $296 million, which included $284 million of dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed. The $86 million from the reduction in deferred tax liabilities following tax reform was a key driver. In addition, $12 million of residual capital supporting our former benefits in health businesses contributed to the total. Overall, dividends as a percent of segment earnings year-to-date were at a higher level relative to our typical seasonal pattern as we prepared for the TWG closing in the quarter. ","Looking at outflows, we paid $36 million in shareholder dividends, $31 million for common stock and $5 million for our preferred stock. For the full year 2018, we expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings. This is mainly due to excess dividend capacity following the reduction in our deferred tax liability and dividends from TWG equal to their 12-month earnings. In other words, legacy Assurant dividends are still expected to equal segment earnings. As always, our dividend outlook is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as profitable growth in the businesses. And we resumed our share repurchase program in July. This reflected our view of the stock as well as the higher level of deployable capital at the holding company following the acquisition close. Through August 3, we have bought back 319,000 shares for approximately $34 million. We believe our capital position will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses, support The Warranty Group integration and return capital to shareholders in 2018 and beyond. ","As Alan previewed, we also update our full year outlook for our segments to take into account TWG. Overall, we expect net operating income excluding catastrophe losses to increase 20% to 25% from $413 million in 2017. The lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% to 24% will be a key driver of that with roughly 1\/3 of savings being reinvested back into the business. We've already committed the majority of the spend in the second half of 2018 to our technology and capability enhancements, originally planned for next year. ","Another important driver of that earnings increase will be the contributions from TWG, along with organic growth in the business. More specifically, for the full year, Global Housing's earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, should increase, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Excluding the tax impact, underlying earnings should decline year-over-year, primarily as a result to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. This will be partially offset by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships as well as increased penetration rates in our multifamily housing business. ","As a reminder, late last year, we benefited from unusually low noncat loss experience and additional income from processing a significant value of club claims related to Hurricane Harvey. We are not expecting either of this to reoccur in the second half of 2018. ","Earnings growth in Global Lifestyle will reflect the combination of organic growth and the TWG acquisition, along with the benefit of lower effective U.S. tax rate. Organic growth will be driven by mobile and auto, partially offset by declines in Financial Services, mainly from runoff and discontinued partnerships as we move into the third quarter. Foreign exchange could also be a factor. ","Looking at Connected Living. Mobile increases will be driven by programs implemented in 2017 and continued expansion from our offerings with existing clients. But as we have mentioned before, mobile trade-in activity may fluctuate, depending on the success of new phone introductions, availability of those phones and mobile carrier promotional activity. We expect continued growth in our Global Automotive business as strong sales from prior periods continued to earn, along with the contributions from TWG. This also includes synergies realized as we combine our operations and streamline our infrastructure. Based on our current plans, we expect to realize approximately $13 million pretax or $10 million after-tax in synergies this year. ","On a run-rate basis, this represents roughly half of our commitment to realize $60 million of pretax operating synergies by the end of 2019. We anticipate the majority of those synergies will be reflected in Lifestyle's results with some flowing through Corporate as we align our shared service functions. ","At Global Preneed, we anticipate earnings will continue to increase modestly before the impact of tax, driven by the expansion of new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. ","And finally, Corporate nonoperating loss is now expected to be between $80 million and $85 million. This reflects the adverse impact of a lower tax rate at roughly 20% and some level of reinvestments, along with the additional net expenses associated with TWG. This will be partially offset by continued expense management. ","In addition, we expect our annual interest expense to increase to roughly $65 million after-tax for 2018, including the debt incurred to finance the TWG acquisition. Net operating income will also include around $11 million after-tax for the payment of our preferred dividends. ","Before moving into Q&A, I want to highlight certain key initial purchase accounting items related to TWG. As of June 30, we recorded $1.5 billion in goodwill and approximately $450 million in other intangible assets. These other intangible assets will be amortized over periods of up to 15 years based on the economic benefit achieved and, therefore, will not be linear. For 2018, we expect the pretax net impact of the purchase accounting adjustments in Global Lifestyle to be around $7 million, of which $1 million was expensed in June. Based on current estimates, we expect that amount to increase in 2019 to $18 million pretax for the full year and $27 million in 2020 as the business previously written begins to earn. This will eventually reach $30 million to $35 million pretax by year five. ","In summary, we're very pleased with our performance and remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year. ","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","My first question on the TWG acquisition. Can you tell us a little bit more about the early indication, now you own it for two months now? How about the integration? And also can you quantify the accretion from this deal because you give some numbers like $9.4 million for one month. Is that good run rate for the rest of the year?","Alan Colberg","Thanks for the question, and welcome to our earnings call as well. Let me start and then, Richard, you should feel free to add to it. We're now two months post-closing, and we're really 9 months post-planning for the deal after we announced that we were fortunate in some ways to have a 7-month period. And so we had a really good line of sight developed to the hard cost operating synergies, and we feel like that's going very well. Two months in, we -- our run rate, about halfway to our $60 million pretax public commitment. And now that we own the company, we are beginning to aggressively go after revenue synergies, leveraging their infrastructure in certain markets that bring our products into those markets and similarly the other way around. We also have a significant opportunity in front of us in claims cost where, with our combined scale, we're now having 47 million vehicles that we manage globally. Both the revenue and the claims costs were not in our deal model. In terms of the accretion, what we've said is, when we announced the deal, it would be modestly accretive. We're certainly still on track for that, and at the right point in time, once we have the run rate synergies, we'll come back to that. But we feel good about the progress, but Richard, what would you add?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, thank you, Alan. Kai, I just mentioned that, yes, as Alan said, the $9.4 million. I would also point out 2 items we highlighted in our conversation in a minute ago. One, it includes $1 million of synergies. We expect it to ramp up to $10 million going through the P&L for the end of the year. And then secondly, on the P GAAP adjustment, $1 million ran through that. In June, we would expect $7 million throughout the rest of the year. So those 2 small adjustments to factor into your analysis.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. My second question on full year guidance. The midpoint of it is about $500 million for the full year. In the first half, you already achieved like $230 million. So when you imply the second half, you probably need $270 million net operating earnings, and that's including the TWG contribution. My estimate each month is sort of around $9 million, so that will be sort of more than $50 million or $60 million, which imply the underlying business -- other business right now. Second half earnings will be less than the first half. Could you sort of explain that a little bit, maybe if the investing in your -- like tax benefits?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. So a couple of things going on. First of all, as you think about the TWG contributions, you also need to add in the interest expense and the preferred dividends. But to go back to the start of your question, and we feel very good about the first half of the year and we don't see any change in our full year outlook for legacy Assurant, which is the guidance we'd originally given. The biggest factor in the second half of the year that will be a negative relative to the first half is spending some of those tax reform savings. We spent a little bit in the first half of the year. We're going to spend the balance of it in the second half of the year, and that's the majority of it. And those are really pulling forward critical technology and capability investments that help us really differentiate and innovate product offerings. But no change in how we feel about the underlying business, and we feel very good about the early days of integrating TWG.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. One last one, if I may, on the potential impact from tariffs. So your contracts are mostly written, but would not be earned in like 2 or 3 years down the road. How do you factor that in like a potential rising cost for the component, for example, for mobiles or for the autos?","Alan Colberg","Yes, so you raised a good point. So most of our current revenue and earnings are coming from contracts that were written previously. So if I think about rising tariffs, it could impact new sales, for example, in mobile, but that would probably drive up the value of used phones. And so when I look at mobile, we don't think it as a material impact when you'd look at the [indiscernible] going on. And then in auto, what tends to happen if new car sales get affected, used car sales go up and we play equally on new and used cars. So as we've looked at it, we don't see a material impact on our business. Obviously, if cost go up over time, we can also factor that into our pricing relatively quickly in the service contract business.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's more on the revenue side impact. I'm more thinking about on the cost or the margin of the business. Are you pricing in potential rising cost of the components or materials?","Alan Colberg","Yes, what I would say, Kai, is it's not going to -- we don't think it will have a material effect on earnings. Some things may go up, but we also benefit from rising cost on things like our used phone disposition business. And if we did have rising cost, we're able to adjust service contract pricing much more quickly than traditional insurance products. So again, we look at it not a material risk to our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS.","John Nadel","I guess first question is when I'm looking at the covered device growth, it's really strong, and I know you guys added KDDI pretty recently, and so that's got to be affecting the growth rate. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about new client activity and the impact on covered devices versus organic growth on more of a same-store basis. What are you seeing there?","Alan Colberg","So I think, and generally, in Connected Living and mobile, we see growth on multiple fronts. So we have good organic growth in our legacy clients as we've added additional services, as the -- as we've talked about in previous calls, gradually, we're seeing rising attachment rates on the core underlying product given the rising cost of phones. Also, TWG did have some mobile business so that's now in the count. And then the new contracts, we -- or new clients we started to serve last year, KDDI and Comcast, that we've mentioned publicly, are performing at or above expectations and going well.","John Nadel","Okay. And what was -- how many covered devices did TWG had? It wasn't that meaningful, was it?","Alan Colberg","About 5 million.","John Nadel","Okay. I didn't realize it was that high. And then I guess secondly, Richard, how much in incremental dividends from the operating units are available to the parent company for the remainder of this year, if we think about relative to that full year earnings?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, John, well, I think the way to look at it is when we gave the indication for the full year in terms of -- or what we've brought up to date, I would say, $296 million, about $86 million of that was linked to the DTL. Another $12 million, we brought up as well. So if you take that back, it gives you about $200 million that we brought up from the operating entities. And basically what we're saying is, we think we're -- we should be in a good position to bring up the operating earnings for the full year for those entities. So if you look at our guidance with the 20% to 25% increase and take out what we've brought up to date, we should be in that kind of zone. Same thing with TWG in terms of what we're expecting from their operating earnings, we should be able to bring those up as well.","John Nadel","Okay, okay. And so the -- so bringing the buyback back earlier, clearly earlier than expected, this isn't just a short-term thing. You've -- you're at the point where you think buyback activity can probably continue through this year.","Alan Colberg","John, as you've heard us say, we are committed to appropriately and prudently managing our capital, and that return -- includes a commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. The fact that we started buyback tells you how we feel about our capital position.","John Nadel","Yes. And last question is just, what was total intangible amortization for the company in the second quarter?","Richard Dziadzio","Total intangible, we'll have that in the Q. I don't have that right with me at the moment because that would include all the intangibles of previous acquisitions and so forth that are running through.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder Bhullar","So I had first a question just on rates and rates, and I think you had mentioned previously that you expect them to decline. I think you said 4 to 5 basis points or something in that neighborhood, but I think you're expecting them to stabilize next year. So clearly, they can't go to 0, but what gives you confidence that they will stabilize next year? And how are you sort of quantifying the 4 to 5 basis points and sort of any reasons on why you feel comfortable that they are not going to continue to drift lower as you go through this year, especially if the housing market remains strong.","Alan Colberg","Yes, Jimmy, I appreciate the question. So our placement rate is really driven by two things. One is the traditional bake in for closure, seriously the link went home, and that's the piece that is countercyclical at the housing market. But equally, we have a large part of our placement that is voluntary where the homeowners choosing to take our product, maybe it's the best available offer, maybe the only available offer. And that piece of our business has actually been growing. One of the benefits of our much more competitive rates over the last 4 or 5 years is we are more competitive. It's just an alternative for the consumer. So the gradual decline in placement rates is really driven by the housing cycle of it. Importantly though, as we go into 2019, we are managing that business and with the expense actions we've been taking that we believe that business can stabilize and have flat earnings roughly next year no matter what happens if the placement rate continues to gradually decline. So we're feeling good, and importantly, that business is countercyclical and we'll grow significantly if we have any issues in the housing market.","Jamminder Bhullar","Okay. And then on buybacks, I realize you're not going to give any specifics on what you intend to do, but I think you might -- part of the reason you bought back stock earlier than almost -- than most people had assumed is because you didn't end up paying -- making a payment on the caller on the deal as you might have thought that -- or you might have thought that, that was possible. Is that a fair assessment? I think -- and if that is the case, then would we assume that buybacks for this year would be limited to what you would have said from not being -- making a payment on the caller? Or could they be higher than what you would have assumed -- would have been the potential payment?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, I'll take that. Thanks for the question, Jimmy. I would say you're right in the first part of your question, which is yes. When we were looking at the final purchase price and the reference rate in terms of the purchase and the stock we were going to issue to TPG, we took into account sort of a conservative left view on that. So the caller did help us when we -- the stock price came up very nicely at close. So that's one factor that came to us saying we can go back and start buying back again. I would say, overall, though, we just found ourselves in a very strong financial position, and so it was one of the elements. It wasn't the total element in our decision to go and start buying back. Go -- as Alan said a few moments ago, just it's hard to then extrapolate for the rest of the year as we go through and look at our performance and get through cat season, we'll go and reassess that and then come back next quarter and update you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.","Mark Hughes","Could you update us on your latest thoughts on the potential cost savings from the -- I think the platform rollout in lender-placed? I think in times past, you've given kind of a specific target as to what that could mean. Could you update us on your latest thinking?","Alan Colberg","Yes, Mark, maybe I'll will start with expenses just more broadly. As you recall, we put out a target of $100 million of kind of G&A expense savings gross by 2020. That does not include lender-placed, the project encore. And at this point, we've realized we owe our investors an update on that, but we're about halfway through realizing the $100 million. And you're starting to see that flow through the P&L. If you look at how our margins have grown in Connected Living, in the fee businesses, the housing, a lot of that growth is coming from the various expense initiatives that had been underway. So we recognize we owe full accounting of that in the future, but we feel good about the progress. Specifically, the lender-placed, which is separate from what I just said, we put out a long-term expense target. We're a little bit above that right now as we're investing in that single platform. But as that continues to roll out over the next year, 1.5 years, we expect we will trend back down. And towards that 42% to 44%, I think it's the long-term expense target we put out for lender-placed.","Mark Hughes","Very good. Any sense you can share of the trade-in market now? I think some of that influenced by new phone shipments. Does that -- is that market showing a little more life? Or is that still kind of a flat more broadly?","Alan Colberg","Yes, the macro trend is increasing whole time by consumers of phones. That's been the fact over the last couple of years. Volumes are a little bit better in 2018 than they were in 2017, but it's still a fairly flattish type market. And if you look at new phone shipments, they're up a little, not dramatically. So as we plan for the year, we kind of expect the rest of this year unless there's significant new product introductions. Mobile device volumes will gradually improve, but not like we saw a few years ago.","Mark Hughes","And finally, I think you touched on this a little earlier, but I did not pick up the specifics. You had mentioned the upside to your thesis in terms of synergies, and I assume you're trying to both -- maybe both revenue and expenses or at least perhaps revenue relative to the TWG acquisition. What was that, that you highlighted?","Alan Colberg","Yes, so a couple of things. So we have the public commitment of $60 million pretax operating synergy run rate by the end of 2019. Think of that as hard cost savings. And what we've said now is we have good line of sight to that, and we're already halfway there on a run-rate basis, two months in. So we feel good about that. The other two I mentioned, were revenue synergies where TWG, for example, have infrastructure in a company -- in a country, but doesn't necessarily have access to clients. We have the client relationships, but don't have that particular capability. We have a long list of specific opportunities that are in development with clients right now. Now most of those won't hit 2018. Those will be things that could begin to benefit 2019 and 2020, but they're not in the deal model. We assumed 0 in the deal model. The other one I mentioned, is just claims cost around autos. If you think about controlling now 47 million vehicle contracts globally and growing, we are one of the largest single distributors of repairs in the market. And how do we then leverage our scale, contracts, get better pricing? That's a significant upside over time for us as well. Again, the deal model assumes 0 for that.","Mark Hughes","Any early estimates on that?","Alan Colberg","No, we have to work through contracts. It will take time. It won't affect 2018, but it's a significant upside in 2019 and beyond. Once we have confidence, we'll obviously share that with our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Campbell from KBW.","Christopher Campbell","I guess first question on Global Housing results are really strong. Any thoughts on why the LPI book wasn't as impacted as noncat -- by noncat weather as some of your competitors?","Richard Dziadzio","Chris, it's Richard. I think it's really a question of the footprint we have versus where the storms happened, and we show in our supplements the distribution of our footprint in the lender-placed area. So if you look at that, you'll see kind of we've -- during the first part of the year, we just weren't in those spots.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, great. And then I'm just -- a question on mortgage solutions. How should we think about the capital-light fee-based margins on that going forward? And then any thoughts on -- I mean, was -- I mean, I'm assuming mortgage solutions margins were less. Was is money-losing? Or can you give us any color there?","Alan Colberg","So a couple of thoughts. First of all, mortgage solutions was not material to our company, but it became -- as we realized there wasn't a good path to market leadership, it became more of a distraction for our team and for the housing team. We have a lot of promising opportunities that I'd rather have us invest resources on, and so that was really behind the decision that there's a better owner who will do a better job with that than we could. But the way to think about it, not material to our company, not material to our outlook for this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners.","Gary Ransom","I had more of a macro question on the automotive services business and just what the -- you talked a little bit about the opportunity you have to grow, but I was wondering about the broader market itself. What is going on there in terms of penetration of the market, the number of consumers buying products? Is there a broader trend that's in a sense helping all the competitors?","Alan Colberg","I think one of the things that we're exciting to us about The Warranty Group deal are some of the longer macro trends in automotive that create real opportunity for future growth. One example is electric, and obviously it's early days still for the adoption of electric cars. But if you think about an electric car from a consumer point of view, there's less that can go wrong, but when it goes wrong, it's really expensive. Our hypothesis to be proven is that, that will drive up attachment over time of service contracts. That's a significant opportunity. And one of the reasons why we're really intrigued by The Warranty Group, they're doing this heavily end markets like China that are ahead of the U.S. in kind of electric car technology today. Another major trend is autonomous vehicles and ridesharing, and again, that creates real opportunities. Cars may be owned differently, and that could change. But every time there's an owner, there's an opportunity when that car sells to attach a service contract. So in the short term, we haven't seen a lot of changes in attachment rate across the vehicle business. But longer term, we feel extremely well positioned compared to competitors to respond to some of these real long-term changes in the way cars are going to be owned and operated.","Gary Ransom","So you're basically saying that you think there's a good chance attachment rates could rise as cars shift ownership, shift type, shift toward electric and that kind of thing.","Alan Colberg","It's our hypothesis, and we're well set up to be beneficiary if that actually plays out that way.","Gary Ransom","All right. I'll take it as a hypothesis. And can I shift over the mobile, same kind of question. It sounds like you were talking about things slowing down a little bit in mobile, and I wondered if you have -- is that -- you need to do something else to build growth in that market. Or are there other opportunities where you can expand what you're doing there?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So Gary, let me make sure I didn't cause any confusion. No, things are not slowing down in mobile. You saw in the quarter, we added not just the new contracts from The Warranty Group, but we had significant growth in mobile. The part that's been relatively flattish the last few years are device trade-in volumes. We haven't had in the last 2, third and fourth quarters, the big seasonal spike up that we used to have. But with that said, volumes are gradually rising just because the market is gradually growing. And opportunities growth is consumers hold the phone longer. With what we've done in some of the markets, we're now doing effectively extended warranties on phones, which go beyond the underlying manufacturer warranty. That's what we've always done in autos. Never been done in phones before at least by us, and it's creating a new growth opportunity for us in mobile. So no, we don't see anything that would cause us to say mobile's slowing down. There's a lot of opportunities, and our growth remains strong.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS.","John Nadel","I want to circle back a little bit on expenses and spending. And just -- I understand in the first half of the year as it relates to sort of the reinvestment of some of the tax savings, there was very little. And can you just give us an expectation in terms of actual dollar amount of spend that you expect in the third and fourth quarter that's sort of specifically related to investing some of those savings to pull forward some projects?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, John. It's Richard. Essentially, what we've said to the market is -- and this was sort of last year, still holds true, is that we would be reinvesting approximately 1\/3 of the tax savings we benefited from the change in tax reform. And think about that as ramping up in the first half of the year as we identified projects started to invest, and what we're really saying is that 1\/3 will flow through over the next couple of quarters and will be in place through the end of the year. Q2 had only about Q2 had about $1 million or so in it, so very small portion of the overall.","John Nadel","Yes, I guess the question to be more specific is, do you expect the 1\/3 of the full year tax savings to be coming through the numbers in the back half of the year? Or 1\/3 of just the year-over-year second half?","Richard Dziadzio","No, exactly the first point, it's 1\/3 of the total amount that will come through in the second half of the year.","Alan Colberg","And you can...","John Nadel","Okay, so that's a big ramp. Okay.","Alan Colberg","Got it? You can look at it and then do the math, but it's in the order of magnitude of $20-or-so million pretax.","John Nadel","Got it, that's helpful. And then I also just wanted to talk real quick on the synergies from TWG. There was a modest amount obviously in the second quarter, $1 million I think you guys mentioned. But you did say, I think, that after two months, so here in the third quarter, that you're run rating at about half of those saves. So I guess my math is implying that $7 million or $8 million of saves at this point on a quarterly basis. Is that about right? Do you expect that to grow significantly from here at least in the calendar 2018?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. Yes, essentially, what we've said is, we're ramping up the synergies given that we just closed at the end of May. Those synergies will be coming through the P&L through the course of the year. So we have -- we've captured about $1 million in the June period. Through the end of the year, not Q3, but through the end of the year, about $10 million will come through our P&L.","Alan Colberg","After tax.","Richard Dziadzio","After tax. Now if you think about that for $10 million to come through, we'll have put in place a run rate much more than that. So what we're saying there is that will be equivalent to really half or about $30 million, which would come through if we stop right there the next -- the rest of the year. Obviously, we'll just keep going and capture more synergies running up to the $60 million target.","John Nadel","Got it. Understood. Okay. So the real big ramp is really more in the second half of '19 when we get to see the -- really the full effect equivalent of those saves?","Alan Colberg","Yes. No, that's the right way to think about it, John. So $10 million after tax hitting this year's P&L. If we stop, as Richard said, and we didn't do anything else ever again, we're now at a run rate of $30 million pretax. That's what will show up in '19 if we didn't do anything else. Obviously, we're going to do a lot more, and we'll -- we are committed to our $60 million pretax target, but significant positive into 2019 P&L.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","I have two. One is on -- can you talk a little bit about your e-commerce partnership in term of the growth rates, the take-up rates as well as the margin of the business? You can compare and contrast with the big-box retailers.","Alan Colberg","Yes. So without talking about specific clients, which we generally don't do, our experience over the years has been a almost complete rotation from traditional big-box retailing, which had relatively high attachment rates to now almost everything is digital, whether it's with e-commerce partners or even the traditional legacy retailers, a lot of that has become digital. Attachment rates started lower in the digital world. We've been, over the years, getting much better at doing attachment on digital, and they're not yet at the same level as the historic big-box was, but it's a lot closer. And it is more profitable business in the sense of you don't have the same intermediaries that are involved. We have more -- it's a better consumer experience because we have more direct control over the consumer experience. So it's a trend that we've been investing against for years, and it made a lot of progress on.","Kai Pan","Roughly, what percentage of that is now in your exchange warranty business?","Alan Colberg","Hard to answer that quickly because our embedded contracts, many of them last for years from the prior business. But most of our new sales, they're digital contracts.","Kai Pan","Okay. That's great. My last one is on the follow-up on the buybacks. And will you be able to participate in the -- after the lockup expiration in August and November?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So regarding TPG, we obviously don't have any insight into what their plans are. We do know they're economically rational and they're going to be motivated if they decide to sell, which they may or may not. They'll be economically rational. We're exploring options where we could help meaningfully manage that if they decided to sell, but we have nothing at this point that we can say on it. ","All right. Well, thank you everyone for participating in today's call. We're pleased with our results so far this year, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our third quarter earnings call in November. In the meantime, please reach out to Suzanne Shepherd or Sean Moshier with any follow-up questions. Thanks, everyone.","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"2807":["Assurant (NYSE:AIZ) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 25, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Francesca Luthi - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Robert B.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi","Thank you, Zach, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2013 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Rob Pollock, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Peninger, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2013 results. Both the release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Rob and Mike, with Chris participating in the Q&A session.","Some of the statements we make on today's call may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected are provided in yesterday's news release, as well as in our SEC reports including our 2012 Form 10-K and upcoming first quarter 2013 10-Q.","Today's call also will contain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com.","Now I will turn the call over to Rob.","Robert B. Pollock","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we continued to build our foundation for profitable growth. While earnings were down, we expanded and further adapted our business in several areas to address market needs.","For example, at Assurant Solutions, we're growing premiums and taking expense actions in underperforming areas to further improve efficiency. At Specialty Property, we're growing our track loan portfolio, moving ahead with the implementation of our new product and resolving lender-placed matters.","At Health, we're executing on our strategy centered on affordable and accessible products as details of health care reform are finalized. And at Employee Benefits, we're gaining momentum in our voluntary products through targeted distribution. These represent several of the actions we're taking to advance long-term growth, enhance profitability and help consumers protect what matters most for them.","Let me now update you on our key performance metrics for the quarter. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, was 10%. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI increased by 2%, and net earned premiums and fees increased by 4%, driven by growth at Solutions and Specialty Property.","Our capital position provides us great flexibility, which was further enhanced by our recent debt offering. We continue to regard our stock as attractively priced and believe repurchases are a prudent use of capital. Through April 19, share buybacks for 2013 totaled $96 million.","Share repurchase activity in the first quarter was affected by settlement discussions with the New York Department of Financial Services. We resumed buybacks following the agreement. Returning cash to investors is an integral part of our disciplined approach to capital management. Our segments generate free cash flow that will allow us to both return capital to shareholders and make ongoing investments to build our business.","Now I'll offer some updates on each of our businesses. Assurant Solutions remains focused on achieving a 14% ROE in 2014. Returns in domestic service contracts continue to exceed our target. On the new business front, our vehicle service contract business benefited from a rebounding U.S. auto market.","Looking ahead, we expect mobile to become an increasingly important contributor to our results. We are making steady progress in growing our mobile franchise by developing innovative offerings and expanding relationships with existing clients.","During the quarter, we launched a small but important program with TIM, the largest mobile carrier in Italy, allowing us to broaden our mobile footprint in Europe. In Latin America, the rollout of our Telef\u00f3nica partnership continues and is going well.","Achieving our 14% ROE goal will require continued expense management. While the U.K. narrowed its operating loss in the first quarter, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. We are committed to meeting our goal of U.K. profitability in the third quarter, but it will require further expense reductions.","At Assurant Specialty Property, we are pleased by the continued progress in our multifamily housing business. We now provide our renters and resident bond products through many of the nation's largest property managers. We believe we can expand this business even further in the future.","Revenues also increased in our lender-placed business. We now provide insurance and related services for nearly 33 million loans. This represents a 16% increase from the first quarter of last year, even though we believe the nationwide inventory of mortgage loans declined over that period.","Our strategy of aligning with market leaders continues to pay off. In the next 2 quarters, we will add another 900,000 loans from portfolio acquisitions by 2 of our clients. Our growth is a testament to our robust capabilities, rigorous processes and high-quality service.","The rollout of our new lender-placed product is on track and will be implemented in 28 states by the end of the second quarter. Our new product forms and rates submitted to New York in March are pending review. In Florida, we will participate in a rate review next month to discuss our previously submitted filing.","During the quarter, the FHFA issued a notice of several potential changes to lender-placed insurance on GSE loans, such as the elimination of commissions and client reinsurance. We anticipate FHFA will publish final regulations later this year. We believe our new product offers solutions to the issues that emerged in the wake of the housing crisis and provides additional flexibility for mortgage servicers. As a leader, we have the capacity, expertise and capabilities to support both our clients and the GSEs as the housing market evolves.","At Assurant Health, we posted a net operating loss for the quarter that was driven by an increased tax liability related to the health care reform. At the same time, Health total sales grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, affirming that choice and affordability are important to consumers.","Major medical product sales increased as we benefited from our network partnership with Aetna. Sales of health access and supplemental products now comprise an increasing portion of total sales. We're encouraged by our sales momentum. We're moving ahead with a new suite of products to cover the essential health benefits required in 2014. We continue to believe our broad product portfolio allows us to meet a variety of consumer preferences.","At Assurant Employee Benefits, our easy-to-use administrative and enrollment systems give us a competitive advantage in the small employer market. We were encouraged that new business sales increased 19% over the first quarter of 2012. Key drivers of this growth were our enhanced demo network and expanding relationships with key brokers, including those focused on voluntary offerings.","Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving steady improvements across each of our businesses by meeting the needs of consumers and clients, and, in turn, delivering long-term value to our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn to Mike for more detailed comments on our results.","Michael John  Peninger","Thanks, Rob. I'll start with Assurant Solutions, where net operating income declined by $6 million year-over-year, excluding a $2.4 million disclosed item in the first quarter of 2012. Higher mortality in our preneed business and the previously disclosed loss of a mobile client contributed to the decline. Mortality experience can vary by quarter, and we expect preneed's results to improve during the rest of the year.","Domestic net earned premiums and fees increased significantly, primarily due to accelerated growth at a large service contract client. Our vehicle service contract business also grew as auto sales continued to rebound. This premium growth offset declines in other accounts, including the lost mobile account. We continue to expect modest growth in domestic premiums and fees over the rest of the year.","Continued expansion in Latin America across all products and the previous expense management efforts in Europe drove a 90 basis point improvement in the international combined ratio, excluding the first quarter 2012 disclosed item. Our international operations remain on track to deliver a 100 to 200 basis point improvement in the combined ratio for the full year, excluding disclosed items.","In the U.S., our combined ratio was 96.9% for the quarter, a slight increase from the prior year but well below our long-term target of 98%, as expense actions taken last year are improving results.","At Specialty Property, net operating income declined year-over-year. The decrease was driven by the $14 million settlement agreement in New York, $5.6 million of losses from hailstorms in the southeast and $4.4 million of unfavorable loss development from Superstorm Sandy.","Significant loan volume growth during the past year contributed to higher expenses in the quarter as we expanded capacity to service new loans. Excluding these factors, Specialty Property's underlying results were solid, demonstrating our leading market position.","Net earned premiums and fees increased by 9% due to premium production from lender-placed loan portfolios added in 2012 and contributions from multifamily housing products.","Our placement rate in the first quarter remained elevated at 2.89%, largely driven by loan portfolios acquired in the fourth quarter of 2012. Absent these loans, placement rates would have declined slightly.","We onboarded 1.7 million loans in the first quarter. And as Rob mentioned, we expect to add another 900,000 loans over the next 2 quarters. These 2.6 million new loans will produce premiums starting later this year. The changing composition of our loan portfolio, combined with macro trends, will lead to lower placement rates in the future; however, the new loans will help sustain our revenues over the course of 2013.","Given the increase in loan volume, we now expect our expense ratio, excluding disclosed items, to increase versus 2012 as we further expand capacity to support this growth and continue to enhance our customer service capabilities. We will update you later on our further progress at Specialty Property once we roll out our new lender-placed insurance product in other states and see the FHFA's final regulations.","Assurant Health reported a net operating loss for the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of health care reform. We increased our estimate of compensation expenses that are nondeductible under the Affordable Care Act. This change in estimate resulted in a $10 million addition to our income tax expense in the first quarter.","Pretax earnings were in line with our expectations. In the first quarter, Health earned $14.5 million compared to $19.5 million in the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was driven by the continuing decline in individual major medical premiums and fewer small group lives. We are pleased with recent sales momentum, which has moderated the rate of revenue decline compared to past quarters. Also total insured lives continues to grow.","Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to remain very high during the rest of 2013. This is primarily due to higher nondeductible compensation expenses and comparatively lower pretax earnings in 2012. For the full year, we now expect a modest after-tax profit in Health. In the near term, we consider pretax earnings a better gauge of underlying potential of the business than after-tax results.","We continue to believe that the long-term prospects for Health are favorable. We are building a product and distribution platform that will enable us to serve markets that should grow significantly as reform unfolds. At the same time, we will continue to manage our expenses and capital efficiently. As the business grows and pretax earnings increase, effective tax rates will moderate, leading to attractive after-tax returns for shareholders.","At Employee Benefits, investment income declined due to continued low yields and fewer invested assets. This decrease, along with the reduction in the discount rate for new long-term disability claim reserves, reduced segment profitability. As in preneed, we experienced higher mortality in the first quarter, but this was entirely offset by continued strong dental experience. Disability incidents and recovery rates remained stable during the quarter.","Net earned premiums and fees declined modestly due to the residual impact of the previously disclosed loss of 2 disability clients last year. For 2013 overall, we still expect net earned premiums and fees to be in line with 2012 due to continued growth in voluntary products. Expense and capital management will remain a focus throughout the year.","Turning to corporate matters. We recently issued $700 million of debt at attractive yields. We set aside $500 million of the proceeds to repay our 2014 notes when they mature next February. The additional debt will increase our after-tax interest expense by $11 million in 2013. However, after the 2014 notes mature, our after-tax interest expense will decrease by about $3 million a year, even with the additional $200 million of debt.","We continue to manage our capital prudently. Consistent with prior years, we took a modest $21 million of dividends from the operating companies in the first quarter. We still anticipate that dividends for the full year will equal operating earnings. As always, dividends may vary depending on the capital needs of the businesses and rating agency requirements.","For the full year, we continue to expect our Corporate segment operating loss to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million, excluding $50 million of after-tax interest expense and roughly $11 million of after-tax benefit from amortization of deferred gains.","In summary, while we had some challenges in the quarter, the underlying results in our targeted growth areas are encouraging. Profitable growth, ongoing expense management and prudent capital deployment remain key priorities. We look forward to continued progress over the rest of the year. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question just on Health. Obviously, there's a lot kind of going on with reform and moving pieces. And just wanted to kind of get your assessment of this business in terms of continuing to be kind of a specialty focus for you guys or what other opportunities you would consider with that segment?","Robert B. Pollock","Sure. So let's go back to when the Affordable Care Act was passed. We evaluated options for the business and concluded our best option was to modify our strategy, focus on affordability and choice, and, quite frankly, I think we've been very pleased with our results today. We said that things were going to be somewhat discontinuous on the results side because the Affordable Care Act provisions would come in over time. But we still feel very positive about where we are in that progression. The sales are up quite a bit, which shows that our product suite is resonating with buyers. And I think the other thing we said is we believe that once all reform is through, and that really won't be done until the end of '14, we're going to have a business that we think we can grow and we think we can earn attractive returns in. And I would say, to date, we are pleased with the results. Remember, in this business, this is not a capital intense business, and so the returns we need to earn on the capital base can produce quite good returns in this segment. And I think we feel quite good about where we are.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the debt offering, I mean, obviously, you have a fair amount of capital already, and you're putting some of that to work here in April. I guess the incremental $200 million of debt, recognizing sort of opportunistic in terms of the cost of that, but how should we be thinking about the avenues you're exploring to kind of put that debt to work?","Robert B. Pollock","Sure. Let me make a couple of comments. I'll turn it over to Chris. I think we've demonstrated that we are very disciplined in our approach to capital management and take deployment very seriously. We obviously had debt that matures in 2014 and we needed to look at how we deal with that going forward. Chris, maybe you can provide some perspective on that.","Christopher J. Pagano","Yes, Chris. I think I guess the important point to make here is nothing's really changed with respect to our strategy around capital. As we mentioned in the remarks earlier, the incremental $200 million is not leading to an increase in our after-tax interest expense, so there's no expense-related component of having the extra debt. We have talked about having extra -- the opportunity put on incremental leverage. We saw an opportunity in the market. We felt like we got some very long-term attractive yields on the debt. But I don't think -- and as Rob mentioned, we're going to continue to be disciplined. We have deployable capital in the form of cash on the balance sheet. We've got operating earnings that we believe we can get at over the course of the year. So tremendous amount of financial flexibility. In terms of deployment, again, the priorities haven't changed, capitalize the operating companies, look for profitable growth opportunities either organically or through M&A and return capital to shareholders, which we've demonstrated that we're willing to do over the last several years. And given where the stock is trading right now, we believe it's very attractive and that it continues to be a prudent use of our deployable capital. So again, those are messages that we have reiterated over the last dozen or so quarters, and it continues to be our strategy going forward.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it'd be sort of opportunistic around kind of the price versus sort of an imminent need to kind of do a transaction or anything like that at this point?","Christopher J. Pagano","Again, I think again, we looked at the market at the time we felt like there was an opportunity to put some modest leverage at no incremental cost in terms of interest expense and view that capital as another -- just additional amount of capital on the balance sheet for deployment.","Operator","We will take our next question from Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to ask a few questions on Specialty Property and what guidance contemplates in terms of rate action, just to get clarity on that. So if you have 28 states with new product filed and you have rate reviews coming up in New York and Florida, if we look at the guidance that you have in place right now for modestly rising premium increases, where does that contemplate in terms of all those moving parts?","Robert B. Pollock","Well, we've certainly factored the change that went into effect in California. We have rate discussions as a normal course in many states. Those are sort of state-specific. I think the important thing is we try to balance all that we know about volume growth from new loans, rates, various other factors. All those things go into our overall outlook that revenue is going to be up a bit this year.","Christopher J. Pagano","And I'd just add to all of that, what Mike said, we filed in each of the states. We certainly have tried to reflect the experience of the states, which in some cases means there were probably modest declines that were filed through in some of those states. But a key component, Seth, is who actually ends up with our product, and that's something that changes over time. We've seen that over the last few years.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just in terms of Florida, I think this is the one that a lot of us are specifically watching out for. I believe you filed for a flat rate in your March filing. That's obviously different than what QBE was eventually able to push through on their side. I know it's a little bit of a different situation, but curious if you could just sort of comment on QBE's eventual 19% rate decline there versus what you filed with.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, yes. Sorry, we really can't comment on QBE's filings. What we do, as we do in every state, is go through a lot of actuarial analysis around the specifics of our exposure and the various components of our rate filings until we feel good about the rates we filed for. We've seen over time when we've acquired new loans that our rates in Florida have been quite competitive in the marketplace. So overall, we certainly will be going through the review process with Florida, but we feel like we've given a very -- we have a very solid analysis behind our filing.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more, if I could, and this is just a sort of a numbers question. If we think about how much has been filed and approved for versus what's still in the pipeline with -- I believe about 14 states still in the pipeline and, of course, New York and California. In terms of the total premium base, how much of that rate is now sort of more in a final state versus how much more will be pushed through the next couple of quarters if we think about in terms of the premium base?","Christopher J. Pagano","Yes, I guess a couple of points here I think that we've said. We're not done in Florida; Florida is our biggest state. New York is a sizable piece of our volume, as well. But I think the other key thing is -- implementation is the key here versus approval because there's a lot of work required to be able to administer these new rates across a servicer's portfolio and provide them with the flexibility our new product provides. So again, we have to do that in stages, and we're going to introduce those additional states in the second quarter. We plan to have them all done by the end of the year, and as we pointed out previously, we think our revenues will be up during 2013.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just going back to Health. I guess the question is you alluded to focusing on pretax as a gauge for the earnings. I'm trying to understand that comment in the context of, does something structurally happen beyond '13 that maybe mitigates the longer-term impact of this tax impact -- tax implication?","Michael John  Peninger","Yes, I think what I was trying to get at, Mark, is when you think about the effective rate for the tax rate for the business, you really sort of think about a couple of things. One is the pretax earnings and then, what are the non -- the expenses that are nondeductible under the Affordable Care Act. And while pretax earnings are lower than ultimately they will be once the business is through the reform transition, the effective tax rate will be lower at that point. So that's why we really think pretax is a good -- a better gauge in the near term, as opposed to saying after-tax with these very high effective tax rates that we're reporting.","Robert B. Pollock","So -- and just to add to what Mike said. If we think about this a little bit, our sales are up, but we're still seeing a decline in year-over-year premiums. We think that -- we're optimistic we can get that to shift. We think when all the provisions are implemented, the market will grow. And therefore, right to what Mike said, we're going to have the opportunity to increase our pretax earnings, which will help alleviate this whole issue.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay -- so the takeaway is that there's nothing that structurally or otherwise can be done to moderate this, I don't know, $4 million, $5 million impact a quarter other than growing into this bigger knot.","Robert B. Pollock","We've chosen to illustrate it in the Health segment. If we were an all health company, it would be spread over the whole thing. We could've spread it over all our segments. We just happen to put it in Health.","Michael John  Peninger","But that is -- we are applying the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Mark. So there will be this element of nondeductible expenses. And as Rob said, I do want to emphasize that if we were entirely a health company of our same overall size, the effect of this would be much less noticeable because it adds -- I think if you think about our corporate effective tax rate overall, this adds somewhere in the vicinity of 50 basis points or 50 to 100 basis points or something like that. But we choose for, just to give you a better insight, to sort of apply the whole cost of that in the Health segment.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So this doesn't in any way change your view of the business model going forward in terms of participation in exchanges, continuing to offer major medical versus the affordable product, et cetera?","Michael John  Peninger","That's correct. We think it's an attractive market. We think it will grow and, again, we'll point out again the capital requirements in this business are not that much.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just my final question is can you just talk a little bit about the Employee Benefits segment? Earnings were a little bit soft, expenses high. What's the outlook on this? Is there anything in the quarter that we should be paying attention to outside of the discount rate adjustment?","Robert B. Pollock","Well, as we commented, our life mortality was high and we see that periodically. Mortality on a life block of our size can vary so we had a fair amount of life claims in the quarter. I don't infer any kind of a trend for that. Dental, we continue to be very pleased with the earnings and the growth in that product. The other thing I think actually expenses for benefits are -- they're pretty carefully managed there. You're seeing a little bit of impact on the expense ratio because of the continued impact of we lost a couple of large disability clients that we've talked about in the past that -- so the top line is suffering the impact of that, which affects the expense ratio. But overall, we expect life to normalize. We continue to think dental is going very well. Voluntary sales are growing. So lots of reasons to feel optimistic about Benefits outlook.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have a question. A little bit following up on Seth's question on the premiums that have been -- that you expect anyway to be approved or to be rolled out through the 28 states by the end of the second quarter. I'm just wondering if you can give us some help, I mean, without specifically knowing what servicers are going to choose to do with the more flexible product. If we just look at it on your premium base today, about what percentage of your premiums is reflected with these 28 states?","Robert B. Pollock","As we mentioned in the fourth quarter, we started with smaller states. I think that continued, and, John, you know that our biggest states are pending, clearly Florida. That all being said, I think that we'll have them all implemented by the end of the year. I think that we'll have resolution on where we are in Florida by the end of the second quarter. And we'll be able to provide more fuller details as the market unfolds. In terms of provisions with servicers, one of the great things about the new product is it affords servicers choices, and we're going to have to see how those unfold. It also provides us with the capability to handle things that are contemplated both in the New York settlement and the FHFA. Last thing I'd just say there is the servicers do a lot of things around the process, including performing important billing and collection features. So we'll work with them as this all works through to provide a smooth transition to everyone involved.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I have a hypothetical for you. The New York settlement is obviously saying no more of these reinsurance or coinsurance arrangements with the lenders or servicers. The FHFA seems to be moving in that direction. And obviously, New York is lobbying hard every other state to incorporate a couple of these items, including that elimination of the sharing of premiums, I guess they call it. To the extent that, that gets passed all the way through, in your entire book you're no longer able to share those premiums or coinsure with your servicers, how much premium comes back from that? Because I know you comingle that amount with the flood program with the government, and it's just we don't know what portion relates to the lender-placed business. Can you give us some help on that?","Robert B. Pollock","Sure. Well, first, we only have, as we've mentioned previously, reinsurance with that small handful of clients, okay? It's full risk transfer that they participated in. So I'll let Mike amplify, but this will have implications on capital requirements in the business. It's a subset of the total you've mentioned, John. And Mike, you just want to talk?","Michael John  Peninger","Really, we haven't chosen to break that out, John, and I think once all these regs come clear, it will play out.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is it enough in terms of dollars of premiums that if this did play out that way and you recaptured all those premiums, is it enough that it would perhaps change your reinsurance program significantly? I mean, I assume there's still more than enough capacity from a pure sort of catastrophe reinsurance program perspective that this wouldn't really be a problem.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. Chris, you want to comment on that?","Christopher J. Pagano","Yes. I think from the perspective of the program, I don't anticipate this leading to any changes in how we structure our program, and we'll comment more on that in the second quarter once we finish the placement. But as Mike mentioned, this would affect our capital holding. We would need to hold incremental capital at the property segment, kind of the rule of thumb is 50% of premium. And again, as this unfolds, we'll adjust accordingly.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","But it's fair to assume that -- I mean, if you're -- if this is really true full risk transfer, then, frankly, your margin on those premiums that you recapture shouldn't really change, correct?","Robert B. Pollock","That's correct.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last question for you is this. I mean, you touched on a little bit in terms of pay is to buybacks earlier and, obviously, a ton of capital flexibility. I know we've got a reset over time on the size of the Specialty Property business, but can you help us with some insights maybe into how you and the board have thought about or discussed dividend policy? Because it seems to me that there's a real opportunity at Assurant to create a -- well, I guess I'll say it this way more succinctly, to put a significant yield on the stock that can very well be supported by free cash flow, even if or even when Specialty Property earnings reset lower.","Robert B. Pollock","Okay. So the first thing is we've increased our dividend every year since we've been a public company, and I believe when we first went public, that dividend was $0.07 a quarter. It's now $0.21 a quarter. I think if you look at all the players in the financial services area, we're one of a small handful who've increased their dividend every year. So we've not been shy about increasing our dividend over time. Chris, you could just elaborate on how you view the use of cash dividend versus other deployment.","Christopher J. Pagano","Yes, sure. And again, John, just another comment on the dividend policy. That is typically, per policy, we have that conversation in the second quarter with the board. We're going to have to do that in the upcoming meeting. Other alternatives, a one-time special dividend is certainly out there, might have some short-term benefit but our capital management policy is focused on the long term. And when we have the opportunity to repurchase stock at a 15% discount to book value, which is roughly where it's trading right now, we think that's the better use of deployable capital and will contribute to long-term -- the growth of long-term shareholder value. So we consider all of the things that you're talking about. We feel very comfortable, though, with our policy at this point. And again, we believe the stock's attractive and have been back in the market and continue to believe it's a good use of the capital we have at the holding company.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sean Dargan with Macquarie Securities.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","I have a couple of questions about Specialty Property. First, the uptick in the expense ratio, which you attribute to the new loan portfolios, is that kind of a run rate expense ratio we should expect throughout the rest of the year?","Michael John  Peninger","Well, there's a lot of expenses associated with onboarding the loan, Sean, and we've got a couple of things going on, just adding the loans, getting them onto the system, and then you've got -- going forward, you've got the service requirement for those. And we're certainly committed to maintaining the highest levels of service that we've had in the past, so that requires a certain amount of staff to do that. We have a very sophisticated system that helps us in this. So there's -- they're not all purely variable cost, but there are certainly some of those, and we want to be sure that we're maintaining our customer service levels.","Robert B. Pollock","And some of those expenses come before the premium shows up. And that's always been how this business has worked and I think will continue to. So these portfolio additions are not coming from existing clients, which is a little bit different than if they come from someone we have already. There's expenses if we lose from one of our clients but it goes to another. We know all the processes, procedures. We know something about the loans. When they come from a portfolio we don't have, there's more work involved.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess why did net written premiums and gross -- or I'm sorry, gross written premiums and net earned premiums decline sequentially? I would have thought, given the onboarding, that, that line would have ticked up?","Christopher J. Pagano","The onboarding, the reason -- the premium results can sort of vary as you're adding loan portfolio, Sean, because it depends on whether the loans are flat canceled versus coming on at renewal. And so when -- and also since our coverage is effective when the date of prior policy, the voluntary policy lapse. Sometimes you get extra premium when it comes on board, which distorts the quarterly pattern of premiums.","Robert B. Pollock","But we add that over time. And I think one of the things to remember is we've added 1.7 million loans that you see in our totals here that have not yet produced premium but will later in the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Along that same line, the 900,000 loans that you're going to be bringing on, are those going to be flat canceled?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, they are.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in the voluntary business, you've had a couple of very strong quarters in a row. What is the sustainability of that? Is that because the brokers are charged up to sell those products? Is there underlying demand that is that strong? What's happening there?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. Well, we think that to those couple of things. One, I would say that our brokers are, in fact, more interested in voluntary because a lot of this is driven by the continued and sort of relentless increase in medical costs, which have small employers and brokers actually more interested in the voluntary benefits or the voluntary platform as a way to provide their employees with a good solid benefit package. And we really think that in addition to having a broad product suite, we have the system's capabilities and the technology to interface with the employer systems to make voluntary a very easy to offer package for small employers because one of the real challenges in the voluntary business is the administrative complexity of it. And we think that's where we have a better mousetrap. And I think that's starting to resonate in the market.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Going back on -- actually, the last 2 questions were kind of what I wanted to get to. The growth in the loan's track of Specialty Property in the quarter was substantial, more than I was expecting. That increase came from where?","Michael John  Peninger","Well, we added 1.7 million in the quarter. I think we had talked about 1.3 million. We had another 400,000 that came in and then we had the 900,000 portfolio that Rob alluded to in his prepared remarks.","Robert B. Pollock","And just remember that we have not had premium on those loans yet come through.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I'm getting a little bit confused here. Flat cancel, they cancel and give them to you; is that accurate?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. I mean, look, in essence, the policy and new offering will go out. We'll have to make sure that they don't have coverage elsewhere. And if that's the case, then we will start earning immediately.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So -- but you just told me you weren't earning immediately.","Robert B. Pollock","Well, that's right. That's because we have included the things. But we've got to run things through our latter cycle so we know that those loans are there, but they've got to run through our latter cycle. We have to verify that they don't have coverage elsewhere. And when that happens, we'll start earning the premium.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the new loans do not affect your -- they artificially lower the placement rate; is that an accurate statement?","Robert B. Pollock","No. We've adjusted for that in the rate we've provided, yes.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the placement rate on the new 900,000? Would you say that...","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. Those are coming from clients where we don't really have a line of sight, Steven. So we'll onboard them, and once we've done that, we should have a line of sight on what will happen.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the discount rate adjustment and Employee Benefits, the drag on earnings from that was how much in the quarter?","Robert B. Pollock","It's about $1 million.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","About $1 million. Okay.","Operator","We'll take our last question from John Hall with Wells Fargo.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have a sort of a longer view question and something that I've been wrestling with as I look farther out '13 into '14, is really how to understand the rate at which the placement rate ultimately comes down on the Specialty Property book of business. I guess it was 2.89% this quarter, up by as a result of the new loans brought on. But how should we think about -- as the real estate market recovers, is there any sort of period in time historically that you can point us back to, where you've got some data that says as foreclosures improve, and the like, the rate came down from X to Y over some period of time.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. So if you go back and look at our 2011 Investor Day, we tried to provide some insight into that, John. I would say at that point in time, we thought it would be over a 5-year period, and you'd see placement rates trend back to 2006 levels, okay? Now what's changed since then? Because there's a couple of things here that in my mind are macro factors that are difficult to predict. And one is unemployment in the economy and as that remains elevated, I think placement rates stay up. I think a second is the number of seriously delinquent loans, some of which just relates to government policy and how they want to deal with those things. There have been a lot of policy around preventing foreclosure. I don't think we could've foreseen that. I think that's probably kept our placement rates up a bit too. I think the other one we're seeing that we didn't at the time, however, is also how voluntary carriers are dealing with their business in CAT-prone areas. Because we do have an overrepresentation in the CAT-prone areas because often coverage isn't available. So I think those are 3 factors that are driving things. I'd also point back to the comment Mike made, which is if you took out those loans we didn't have in 2012, our placement rate was down modestly in the quarter. And so we are seeing signs that, that it's happening and we expect it will happen as the economy improves.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess as we think about what you provided back at the Analyst Day, that 5-year time frame, is that still the time frame over decline that you'd be thinking about now?","Robert B. Pollock","Well, I haven't been very good at predicting this, John, so let's start with that. To me, it's been up and I think one of the reasons it's up is that last factor I brought up. And so I think it's very difficult for us to be able to assess how it will come down. But the other way I look at that is we've also added quite a few loans to the portfolio since we rolled that information out.","Great. I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you on key milestones in the months ahead. And please feel free to reach out to Francesca and Suzanne with any additional questions you might have.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi","Thank you, Zach, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2013 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Rob Pollock, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Peninger, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter 2013 results. Both the news release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Rob and Mike, with Chris participating on the Q&A.","Some of the statements we make on today's call may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected are provided in yesterday's news release, as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2012 Form 10-K and our first quarter 2013 10-Q.","Today's call also will contain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted on assurant.com.","Now I'll turn the call over to Rob.","Robert B. Pollock","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results were in line with our expectations. While earnings were lower than last year, we are pleased with our progress in expanding each of the areas we are targeting for profitable growth. Our unique capabilities are helping us reach a broad group of consumers in the mobile, renters, health and voluntary benefits insurance markets. At the same time, our core businesses continue to generate free cash flow, allowing us to return capital to shareholders.","I'll start by summarizing our results against the 3 important financial metrics we use to track our progress. Annualized operating return on equity excluding AOCI was 10.5% year-to-date. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI increased by 5.2% since year end, and revenue, defined as net earned premiums and fees, increased by 5.8% compared to the first half of 2012, driven by strong growth at Specialty Property and Solutions. We're also encouraged by the sequential increase in premiums at health and employee benefits. In the quarter, we've repurchased $174 million of our stock, and we increased our quarterly dividend by 19%. The strength of our balance sheet provides great flexibility. We continue to look for opportunities to invest in our businesses to support our long-term strategic objectives. At the same time, returning capital to shareholders remains a key priority. We plan to repurchase shares during the current quarter subject to a number of factors, including the level of storm activity.","Now I'll offer updates on each of our segments. Assurant Solutions continues to drive toward its goal of a 14% ROE in 2014. We're focused on tightly managing expenses and growing our business profitably in targeted areas through new and existing clients. Specifically, we're scaling our mobile business, expanding our Latin American operations and improving results in our U.K. business. We are building momentum in our mobile business. During the quarter, we expanded our footprint. Earlier this week, we announced that Solutions was selected as T-Mobile's partner for their new JUMP! program, including premium handset protection. Solutions will serve as the risk manager and customer service administrator of the program, the first of its kind to allow consumers to enjoy frequent equipment upgrades without penalty. The new program will be available to 26 million T-Mobile-branded customers in the U.S. While Solutions will be the direct writer of the business, T-Mobile is likely to retain the underwriting risk. We anticipate that the JUMP! program's contribution to net operating income this year will be modest due to the upfront investments necessary to service this business. It will grow in 2014, particularly in the second half of the year as the number of subscribers enrolled in the program ramps up.","During the quarter, we began offering mobile protection to eligible prepaid customers of Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile, brands both owned by Sprint. As part of the program, we converted existing mobile protection customers to our platform at the end of June. We expect these wins to more than offset the mobile business we lost last year over the next few quarters. The ramp-up and ultimate size of these new programs will depend on the appeal of our products in the marketplace. In addition, we're pleased to report the renewal of our partnership with U.S. Cellular for an additional 4 years. Their constant focus on product innovation and the consumer experience has made U.S. Cellular a valued client and a great partner to Assurant Solutions for many years. We expect to generate attractive returns in mobile as we continue to develop value-added solutions for our partners and their customers in this fast-changing market.","Serving the growing middle class in Latin America remains a priority for Assurant, and we are finding many ways to do so. As an example, we recently partnered with Nissan to provide service contracts to their customers in Mexico. We believe we're well positioned to support the growing auto warranty market in Latin America. In Europe, we completed additional restructuring actions last month to better ensure U.K. profitability in the third quarter. We believe that our streamlined operations and focus on extended service contracts, including mobile, will allow us to improve returns in the region longer term.","At Assurant Specialty Property, we posted strong revenue growth across all of our key product offerings. In our multifamily housing business, we now serve nearly 900,000 policyholders nationwide. This represents a 28% increase since the second quarter of last year. As more consumers choose renting over home ownership, our relationships with leading property managers and other distribution partners will help us capitalize on this growing market.","In our lender-placed insurance business, our alignment with market leaders continues to pay off. We now attract nearly 34 million loans nationwide and expect to add another 1 million loans in the third quarter. In order to support this volume, we are leasing a new facility in Dayton, Ohio. This will bring more jobs to the area and build additional capacity so we can continue to provide high-quality service and administrative support for our clients and the homeowners we ensure.","During the quarter, we continued our proactive outreach with state regulators as well as the FHFA. We completed the implementation of our new lender-placed product in 28 states. In the third quarter, we will introduce the product in 10 more approved states. Our filings in New York and Florida are moving through the rate review process. We responded to the additional questions the departments have raised and will continue our dialogue until the process is completed. At the federal level, the FHFA recently convened a roundtable discussion with key constituents. The purpose was to discuss proposed changes to lender-placed insurance for servicers of GSE loans. We participated in the session and will continue to assist the FHFA and our clients during their review. We will update you further as we complete the rollout of our new product in other key states and the FHFA finalizes any changes on lender-placed insurance practices for GSE loans.","At Assurant Health, total sales grew 35% as we produced double-digit increases across all product lines. We're pleased by continued sales momentum, evidence that consumers recognize the value and affordability of our products. In the quarter, we continued to work through the next phases of health care reform. We updated our major medical products to cover the essential benefits required by the Affordable Care Act. We decided to defer our participation on public health exchanges until 2015. Instead, we're focusing resources to help our customers and distribution partners understand how the Affordable Care Act impacts healthcare during this period of transition. As medical costs continues to increase, we believe consumers will find our affordable choice plans even more attractive.","Assurant Employee Benefits posted another strong sales quarter. Year-to-date sales are up 18%. Earnings reflected pressure on our disability products, but dental experience was again excellent. We recently completed a redesign of our dental offerings to provide more tailored solutions for small and midsized employers. These enhancements, along with our broad dental network, should continue to increase the appeal of our products to employers and their employees. Overall, throughout Assurant, we remain focused on driving profitable growth across all of our businesses, and we're pleased with our progress so far in 2013.","And with that, I'll turn to Mike for more detailed comments on our results.","Michael John Peninger","Thanks, Rob. I'll start with Solutions. Net operating income declined $2.5 million after adjusting for a $3.8 million nonrecurring benefit in the second quarter of 2012 and a $2.7 million charge for a reduction in force in Europe this quarter. preneed earnings declined primarily due to lower investment yields. Expenses are up in preneed, reflecting higher amortization of selling expenses due to the growth that we've seen over the last several quarters. In addition, results at Solutions reflect the previously disclosed loss of a mobile client.","Net earned premiums and fees increased by 7% versus the second quarter of 2012. Domestic premium growth again reflected promotional activity at the large client we mentioned last quarter, and we also saw increases in our vehicle service contract business. Expansion in Brazil and Mexico drove higher premiums abroad. The international combined ratio declined 250 basis points after adjusting for the disclosed items. Growth in Latin America and previous expense management actions contributed to the improvement.","For the full year, our international operations remain on track to deliver a 100 to 200 basis point reduction in the combined ratio, excluding disclosed items. The domestic combined ratio remained near the long-term target of 98%. For the second half of 2013, we continue to expect modest top and bottom line growth as we pushed toward our goal of a 14% ROE next year.","Specialty Property posted strong results in the quarter, driven primarily by revenue growth from lender-placed loan portfolios added during the past year and the continued expansion of our multifamily housing business. As expected, the additional growth in lender-placed business drove higher general expenses in the quarter.","Our placement rate in the quarter was 2.8%, representing a modest decrease from the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of 2012. We expect placement rates to fluctuate in the near term, reflecting the composition of our recently added loan portfolios, but longer term, placement rates should decline as the mortgage market rebounds. In the second quarter, we reported a sequential decrease in premiums ceded to clients because a client quota share arrangement was discontinued. This is detailed in the ceded premium shown in our financial supplement. Starting April 1, we began retaining premiums and underwriting risks for this previously reinsured client. Premiums written prior to April 1, along with the associated claims, will continue to be ceded proportionately as they run off during the next year.","During the second quarter, we completed our 2013 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program at attractive rates. We expanded coverage by nearly 20% to support growth in our lender-placed business. Our program also supports a small but growing footprint in the Caribbean and Latin America, where Specialty Property and Solutions partnered to develop a traditional dwelling insurance product for a global banking client. Due to the continued growth of lender-placed loan portfolios, the reduction in ceded premiums and the expansion of our multifamily housing business, we expect Specialty Property's revenues for the full year to grow from 2012 levels. Our expense ratio will also increase as we expand capacity to support the growth in the business.","Assurant Health reported a small profit in the quarter, consistent with our outlook for the full year but down considerably from 2012. The decrease is due to a higher effective tax rate and the absence of $14 million in aftertax real estate joint venture income that was included in our second quarter 2012 results. Our loss ratio increased to 75.2%. This reflects less favorable experience compared to the prior year and pricing changes in response to the minimum loss ratio targets in our major medical business. We expect the ratio to remain around this level in future quarters. We are pleased that net earned premiums grew 4% from the first quarter of this year and that insured lives continues to increase. Growth in our book of business remains an important long-term metric for health. We're encouraged by our progress and remain cautiously optimistic as the health care market enters a period of unprecedented change in the second half of 2013. At Employee Benefits, net earned premiums and fees were flat year-over-year but up slightly from the first quarter, evidence that our enrollment and administrative services are gaining traction with voluntary customers.","Earnings declined on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to less favorable disability results and the previously disclosed reduction in the discount rate for new claim reserves. Disability experienced primarily reflected lower recoveries in the quarter. We've maintained strict pricing discipline in our disability business during the past year and will take additional action as needed. Results across the other product areas were solid. For the full year, we expect continued growth in our voluntary business and overall premiums at Benefits to remain in line with 2012 levels.","Turning to corporate matters. We took $185 million of dividends from the operating companies in the second quarter. We continue to anticipate that business segment dividends for the full year will equal operating earnings. As always, dividends will vary depending on the capital needs of the businesses and rating agency requirements. As Rob noted, we repurchased $174 million of stock in the second -- in the quarter. We also retired approximately $24 million of our 2014 senior notes through open-market transactions. At the end of the second quarter, total debt outstanding amounted to approximately $1.6 billion, including $476 million that will mature in February of 2014. As a reminder, the March issuance increased our aftertax interest expense by approximately $4 million in the quarter.","Our corporate operating loss was $22 million, reflecting investments in areas targeted for growth and additional benefit-related costs. For the full year, we still expect our Corporate segment operating loss to be between $65 million and $70 million but likely at the high end of that range. Our investment portfolio continues to perform well. Yields increased in the quarter, which reduced our unrealized gain position, but they still remain very low compared to historic levels. Our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined asset liability management minimized our portfolio turnover and helped moderate the pace of decline in our portfolio yield.","We're pleased with our progress in 2013 and look forward to improvement over the second half of the year. And with that, we'll ask the operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Jeff Schuman with KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could help us a little bit on the change in the captive reinsurance. Is the amount of client-ceded premium likely to remain approximately at the level that we saw in the second quarter, or will that actually come down from here?","Robert B. Pollock","Mike, you want to provide some of the details there?","Michael John Peninger","Yes, well, we cede -- as you know, Jeff, some of our clients we have reinsurance arrangements with. And this client this quarter terminated their arrangement. So their ceded premium to them will obviously decline over the last several quarters. Whether the aggregate total goes down depends on volume in the other clients, and there's also some ceded reinsurance outside of lender-placed, too, that go through that line.","Robert B. Pollock","I think it's also to just point out that we will have the premiums. We'll also have the risks associated with that business, Jeff, going forward. So the good news, more premiums; second, we'll have the associated risk associated with the business.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so essentially you stopped ceding new premiums to that particular captive, but there are still -- there's still premiums that you ceded earlier that's -- okay...","Michael John Peninger","Unearned premiums at that $630 million will run through under the -- they'll run through the income statement on the same reinsured basis over the next year, basically.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then on the placement rate, I'm wondering if you can somehow give us a little better feel for the dynamics there, where it appears that maybe the placement rate is actually coming down on some of the legacy business, but then that's kind of obscured by what's happening in the new business. Is there any way for us to kind of see through those dynamics a little better?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. I'll let Mike talked about the details in a second, but I think we want to start with just thinking about there's a lot of factors influencing things here. It starts with the general economic situation in terms of people's ability to make payments on homes. So it's impacted by unemployment rates. It's also impacted by government policy around support of the housing market and in particular, trying to prevent foreclosures. That goes in a little bit then to thinking of about we see differences in that placement rate in different areas. And Mike, maybe you want to expand a little bit on that.","Michael John Peninger","Yes. I think to your point, Jeff, if you look at -- the placement rate on our legacy business, I'd say, is slightly down, but you get influx of new portfolios, all of which have sort of unique characteristics. And so you get variation in your overall aggregate levels. So you've got this slowly declining -- or slow thus far declining legacy rate, then, when you get the noise essentially introduced by the new portfolios.","Operator","And we'll move next to Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question, you mentioned you're going to be rolling out in 10 more states in 3Q, so you'll will be up to 38. Wondering if you could give an update on kind of percentage of premium that those represent, particularly as you now move through some of states that are a bit larger.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, I think they're the medium-sized states, Jeff. I think the important issue is approval in Florida and New York contribute a big portion of our block, and we need to receive kind of approval there to proceed. So they're not in the totals. Obviously, if we can get through the process there, which we anticipate happening, we'll be in a position to roll there as well. And Florida, as we've mentioned, represents about 1\/3 of our business.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one just quick follow up to Jeff's question regarding the ceded business. Was the book that was on-boarded to you, was that contemplated as you went through your cat program this year?","Robert B. Pollock","Well, I think that we've been looking at exposure growth in general, and you see that we bought some more reinsurance at the top end. And I'll let, perhaps, Chris just comment on the program a little bit.","Christopher J. Pagano","Yes. Chris, just one point of clarification. In the scenarios where premium is ceded, the client participates in our cat program alongside us. So paying the premiums, the claims, et cetera, et cetera. So when we put a program together, it's contemplating the aggregate book. Now with respect to the additional $300 million of coverage, that is a function of additional loans that we've -- growth in the program, growth in the risk and, in particular, obviously, growth in the program in the cat-prone areas.","Michael John Peninger","And we always look at that top end and we want to be sure we have enough coverage there, Chris, because that's -- at the lower end, that's sort of an earnings volatility issue. At the top end, we want that protection. So we try to be relatively conservative in setting that top-end limit.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then in health, I guess, the sales there continue to be pretty robust. You had the sequential increase in premiums, which I think was the largest since 2003 or so. And recognizing a lot of that has been driven by the shrinkage in insured lives, health care reform and all, but do you feel you're starting to get a kind of positive inflection point here where scale can start to build a bit, potentially driving down that tax rate over time?","Robert B. Pollock","We're certainly hoping so. Again, I think that all of our efforts at -- when the Affordable Care Act was enacted and the strategy we embarked upon around affordability and choice, we really think is paying off. Obviously affordability will continue to be a big issue going forward for us, Chris. And the fourth quarter of this year is obviously going to be kind of a brave new world with the introduction of the exchanges. We'll see what happens there. But we think our fundamental strategy of driving at that affordability is going to prove out. So we're quite optimistic about prospects in the health business.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one last quick one just for Chris, I guess, regarding buybacks. Recognizing you want, I guess, to consistently be in the market, how are you thinking about kind of the pace here as we enter hurricane season? I know in the past, you've been somewhat reluctant for a few years back. Rob, I think you made the point that the stock was just way too cheap and you'd be pretty active during the hurricane season. So I just wanted to get some updated thoughts there.","Christopher J. Pagano","Well, the capital deployment decisions and the share repurchase activity is always a forward-looking exercise. So -- and I think from where we stand right now, with $640 million of deployable capital and a stock that we still believe is undervalued and attractively priced, we plan to be in the market through cat season. We'll of course be more conservative because that's just how we are, but do want to be in the market consistently and expect to -- there's a program in place right now, which has been in place since the 10b5-1 programs, since early April. Once we exit blackout period, we'll recalibrate and make some decisions around repurchase activity in the next several months.","Operator","And we'll move next to Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","A few questions. On Solutions, you have reasonably good transparency, at least into the revenue side. And I'm just curious, in terms of the achieving the 14% ROE into '14, is there anything else you need to do on either the expense side or on the capital side to get there?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, so a couple of things. We are driving at all levels. I think -- and I'll let Mike comment on the expenses, but just in general, we've got changes going on in the market that require that we be nimble about adjusting expenses as markets come and go. I think we're demonstrating we can do that. Each of the businesses have slightly different dynamics associated with it, but we feel very good about the targeted growth areas around mobile, around what we've got going on with vehicle service contracts both in the U.S. and in Latin America. Mike, do you want to...","Michael John Peninger","Yes, I don't know that -- just the themes that we've talked about, Mark, are really where we're continuing to focus. As Rob said, driving at that growth, particularly in mobile. We also like to sell our service contracts, and we're seeing good growth there. Continued growth in Latin America is important, and expenses are going to continue to be a focus. We took some more action in Europe this quarter. And overall, Solutions, if you think about the domestic credit business, that continues to sort of run off. We've got to continue to drive at that expense control. On the capital side, Solutions has a relatively complicated structure. There's lots of entities, but we're constantly looking for opportunities to take capital out. Just like in all of our businesses, we want to capitalize appropriately for our best ratings and then get everything else up to the holding company. A little more complicated in some of the entities, but we continue to work on a regular basis at that.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just on the T-Mobile program, is there any way of framing out a 3- or 5-year revenue opportunity for this? I'm going a little bit by memory. I thought that you kind of did that on the Telef\u00f3nica deal. I'm just curious if there's any way of thinking about this 26 million subscriber base, and how big can this program get?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. So, I'm going to take a step back because I think you've got to frame this and give T-Mobile tremendous credit for what they've done here. Because think about what they've done is they've introduced the program that is both offensive and defensive. So on the offensive side, they're trying to grow new subscribers, and they've got a program now that will be attractive to anyone who is looking to be with a carrier that will allow them to upgrade regularly, okay? And we've introduced, and we're all of like 2 weeks into it. Enthusiastic start, but way too early to know exactly what it's going to mean. In addition, it's defensive in that the current subscriber base was 26 million subscribers. Anyone who might be contemplating leaving them for a phone upgrade now is going to say \"Gee, I can get this here and going forward, I can upgrade a couple of times a year.\" So they've really got a great program designed. What we're going to find out is, gee, how many new subscribers does it help them attract, and how many of their existing subscribers are going to convert? And we'll know a little bit more about that in a couple of quarters, but I think trying to speculate on it right now is -- we'd just be guessing.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Out of curiosity, the public health exchange deferral until 2015, why?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. Well, I think it's just looking at the difficulty in the exchanges getting up, exactly getting a line of sight on who they're going to attract. We sat and looked at our existing insureds and distributors and said, \"Our time would be better spent making sure they understand how they're impacted than trying to attract particularly new people on the exchanges when it's unclear just how many are going to be attracted to them.\" So we're focused on that large distribution footprint we have. Our national distribution relationships with State Farm, USAA -- we just thought the resources were better applied there.","Michael John Peninger","And there are so many unknowns with the exchange and how people will react and purchasing decisions, and we think we can get the learnings from that by observing from the side and, as Rob said, putting our resources into other areas to be sure we're ready to go in 2015. I'd also note that I think from -- you read as much as I do, but other carriers are thinking about this same issue, and you're seeing a lot of carriers being pretty cautious about the degree of participation in 2014 as well.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. I was just -- no change in strategy between kind of major medical and the access product in terms of emphasizing access disproportionately relative to what you've been doing?","Robert B. Pollock","No.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions for you guys. Rob, if I think a bit bigger picture about the mobile wins here with T-Mobile, I think you mentioned a couple of things with Sprint as well. When I think back a couple of years ago, when you guys bought the -- I think it was called Signal Holdings, when you made that purchase, I think at the time you said, \"We'll need to win a couple of new relationships or contracts for this to truly pay off and achieve targeted returns.\" Assuming you get some growth out of these new relationships, in particular, T-Mobile, does that get you there?","Robert B. Pollock","Well, a couple of things. Certainly, we're thrilled about the wins we've got going on, and I think they demonstrate that we're a player in this market. The Signal is an asset we are leveraging that's helping us in all of these different areas. And you're right, John, I certainly said that we were going to need to grow our footprint in mobile for the signal acquisition to be a success. I think last year, we also told investors we're earning targeted returns in the mobile business already. We think that these new programs provide us an opportunity to continue to demonstrate we can come up with things that are appealing to our partners and to their consumers in the marketplace.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then in particular, on the T-Mobile program -- so this sounds like it's an administrative sort of fee relationship. I guess you'll be booking gross premiums, gross written premiums, but it sounds like that will be ceded right back to T-Mobile. So how should we think about -- and can we think about like the way that the margin works on this business? Or can you give us some color? Maybe just not specifically on T-Mobile but just in general on how an administrative arrangement would work versus a true insurance arrangement on the mobile side?","Robert B. Pollock","Sure. Mike, why don't you start by just commenting on these large relationships?","Michael John Peninger","Sure. Well, these type of arrangements, just like in case of our large credit arrangements in the past, there's multiple ways to structure the deals, and they're customized to each client. But you're certainly -- we need to finalize the details of the T-Mobile arrangement. But assuming, as we said, that it's likely to be reinsured, then you're right, John. You would see gross written premiums, you would see ceded, you'd get some fees, you'd get ceding commissions. So there's a variety of sort of details that have to go through. And once those are all final, we'll be able to talk a bit more about those. But overall, we still feel really good about the pricing of the business, the return potential of it, et cetera.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, and I'd just point out that, again, if they decide to reinsure, we're just going to have to put up a little bit less capital. We are the risk manager on the program for them. We're doing a lot of the logistics -- logistics support, et cetera. And I think we feel tremendous about having landed this relationship.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. I know, I get that. I mean, if we're -- if we compare and contrast, though, a fee type of arrangement versus one where you're truly taking insurance risk, is it fair to say that there is no capital requirement in the former versus something fairly significant in the latter?","Robert B. Pollock","I wouldn't say no, because obviously there's working capital issues, John...","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","The inventory.","Robert B. Pollock","And when you think about all those things, yes. But I think we are doing a lot of things to try and support T-Mobile, just as we try and do with service contract providers, as we've historically done with credit insurance business. I think we can find lots of ways to help them.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just a housekeeping item. Can you remind us -- I know you guys took $185 million in dividends up from the subsidiaries of the operating companies in 2Q. Can you remind us what that number was in 1Q?","Robert B. Pollock","I think so far this year, we're at about over...","Michael John Peninger","Just over 200, I think.","Robert B. Pollock","206 maybe, I think.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it was modest in 1Q. Okay.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then just when I think about that ceded -- it was within the Specialty Property business, and now you've broken out that ceded to clients for us. How should we think about potential for other clients to discontinue that as we move forward? I know part of the New York settlement specifically states these arrangements have to be terminated. Are we there yet that all of those have been terminated?","Robert B. Pollock","Mike, you want to comment on that?","Michael John Peninger","Yes, New York, we're certainly complying with all the provisions there. More broadly, we just have a handful of clients that cede, John, that we have reinsurance. And all those make specific decisions about how they want to handle their arrangements. And so whether they choose to continue or not continue is really their decision.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, I get that. I'm just -- I guess I'm more curious whether there's been any real dialogue with that handful of clients without naming names or sizing each one. It seems to me that -- I don't know, my sense is that the direction here is that, that would -- that ceded to clients would continue to decline. Are you having those discussions, or is it just not happening?","Robert B. Pollock","I think those are really client decisions. And if they approach us, we certainly, again, just -- it's really kind of like the T-Mobile discussion we have. There's lots of different ways to structure things here. And how the transfer of risk mechanism works on this, we're going to be back on the risk on some things that had previously gone to a client.","Michael John Peninger","Yes, as you know, and just to say it, obviously, if the reinsurance goes away, the risk changes, the claims -- these things are all risk-transfer mechanisms. So it's important to keep that in mind, too.","Alexander P. Paris - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then I just have one last quick one, and that is do you guys feel like you have any visibility on the timing for some resolution on the Florida and New York case filings?","Christopher J. Pagano","It's a back-and-forth process. They've asked a number of questions. We've responded. They've asked a few more, we've responded. So it's just an iterative progress, John.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","But it is in their court at this point?","Christopher J. Pagano","Correct.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James and Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Want to, I guess, just rehash a couple of things here. With response -- with regard to the captives ceded, Jeff's question. To start this off, I didn't really understand it, I guess. I want to ask it a different way. Going forward for the rest of the year, all else equal, just looking at the ratio of ceded premium to captives relative to gross, should that ratio change because of this change from this one client?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes.","Michael John Peninger","Well, again, it'll go down for that client. The aggregate amount depends on growth in other reinsured clients.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","No, of course.","Michael John Peninger","But this one of course will go down, yes. There's an unearned premium, essentially, at the end of June that will run off through our income statement over the next 12 months, basically, and the ceded amounts will run off then.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the new portfolio business that you're putting on in Specialty Property, the $1 million. Could you remind us, is that flat cancel?","Michael John Peninger","It is. That will start to contribute over the second half of the year.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just returning to health, just so I'm clear here. So you're not going to participate in the exchanges? I know you sell access products, you sell short-term medical products, you sell supplemental products as well, but you also sell individual major medical. Will you be able to continue to sell major medical in 2014, off the exchanges, without customers having to pay the penalty?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. In fact, I mean, I would go so far as to speculate that most of the individual health insurance will be sold off-exchange.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, I'm just talking about individual major medical here.","Robert B. Pollock","I'm talking -- that's what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about for us particularly, I'm talking about for the whole market.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then to -- it has been rumored that Assurant -- I guess, talk -- Assurant, among others, has been very, very active in renewing individual major medical policies off the original renewal dates. Could you discuss that?","Robert B. Pollock","Sure. I think the big key is there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding health care reform, and we have a lot of customers who are seeking clarity and certainty on how to deal with things. And we certainly have a program in place that allows new customers a line of sight on keeping their business under current arrangements through December 14, I believe. And I'm sure some of that may be spilling over to the existing in-force as well. I think it's largely geared towards new buyers, but I think it's probably gone that way as well.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So my question, then, is to what extent did that -- because you talked about the access products, what have you. Was that a major player in the increase in sales and premium in the quarter?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, so I think about things 2 ways. First is the access versus major medical is really a suitability decision, Steven, around assessing the buyer's needs. And a lot of that is around affordability, okay? I certainly think that buyers in the marketplace who look for having clarity around their major medical purchase through the -- late into '14 certainly helped us. It helped us drive sales. But as well, with that, our rollout with Aetna's certainly helped us be more competitive in all the major medical markets, and that's been a contributor, too. And then I'd also add, we've worked hard to help distributors understand how things are going to work, and I think a lot of them are appreciative of that and see opportunities for themselves in the health marketplace as a result.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","One more, if I may, back on Specialty Property. The -- your premiums were up very -- not gross written premium, gross earned premium. Up very, very nicely sequentially. Yet, if you look at the number of loans that you track, multiply that by the placement rate, the number of loans that you have insured probably didn't increase, maybe slightly decreased, maybe slightly increased because from the first quarter, yet you had that nice surge in premiums. Also, the total insured value fell. So is that increase that we saw sequentially, is that really renters?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. So lots of different things in there, but I think the first is that we've added 900,000 loans. They're not producing yet. And I think similarly, when we added some loans in the first quarter into the totals, they were only producing a little bit. So we're trying to give you a representation on the number of tracked loans. I think it then needs to be distilled a little into which of those are producing or not producing. But then if we move over to our renters area, we are seeing very nice growth in that business and feel good about the prospects there as well. We've mentioned that things are up in all our different products in the property area. So, I think, progress on all fronts.","Michael John Peninger","And until you get the loans on board, you don't have a clear line of sight as to the sort of the placement rate characteristics of those either, Steven. So that just introduces a little bit of uncertainty in looking forward, too.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. I understand that, Mike. The -- where I was getting at here was that if you were to take a look at the loans that you track, I'm assuming those are considered on board, or I've always thought that's what that meant. And then you multiply that by the placement rate, the number of actual loans being insured didn't change between the first quarter and the second quarter.","Robert B. Pollock","I think in a steady inventory situation, that would be true, Steven. With all the movement we have going on in these portfolios, we have to go through a letter cycle before they might produce. You just introduce a lot of vagary into some of the placement rate numbers.","Michael John Peninger","And the timing of when the loans come on, and then what's happening with the legacy policies, as well, all those things. You're doing a method there that makes sense conceptually, but there's just a lot of detail under the covers when you try to convert some of those broad, aggregate indicators we give you and try to translate them into the actual income statement. It's just a little bit complicated by a lot of timing issues.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","I have a question about Solutions and your mobile program with T-Mobile. I mean, I think you alluded to it, but it seems like we're going through a fundamental shift in the way subscribers buy phones in this country. So can you just describe how that works? I mean, why would I buy a warranty if I can just get -- or buy a newer phone 6 months from now with no penalty?","Robert B. Pollock","I mean, a couple of things. I think your first point is absolutely an issue that's going on, which is the phone and how it's paid for has been a part of the monthly service fee. And I think that, that's something all carriers are reviewing and trying to figure out, are there different ways to deal with that, okay? So I think that one trend is, \"Hey, I have to buy a plan and I get the phone at a subsidized rate.\" I think carriers are reviewing all that and saying, \"Are there different ways to do that?\" Okay? Now I'd separate that from -- in terms of the warranty, it's not just a warranty. There's a lot of things involved in the services we provide. So I would say that trying to look at just the warranty aspect maybe isn't the right way to think about it. I think it might be to think about, \"How do I protect my data, how do I make sure I have that phone to me immediately?\" All these different components start to work in. \"Gee, I want to trade in the phone that maybe I'm paying for myself. How does that work?\" All that is wrapped up into this kind of program that T-Mobile's introduced.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then when we think about the portfolio adds that you've been having in recent quarters in the Specialty Property, what's driving that? I mean, where are they coming from, and why would somebody not want those portfolios?","Michael John Peninger","Well, we think we do a great job at servicing our clients. We've been at this for a long time. We've got the systems and processes, and I think our clients are very happy with our service. So whenever there's sort of RFPs, we feel real good about our chances of winning business through the RFP process. And then you've also got different servicers and banks out there that are making decisions about their own portfolios, and so sometimes they'll decide to sell the servicing rates or move the servicing rates. And so by our presence in the market, we often are able to win as -- grow along with our clients because we stay aligned with the industry leaders in the marketplace.","Robert B. Pollock","That's right. So I mean, if you put that at a big macro level, the money center banks have capital requirements related to the mortgage servicing rates. And I think all the time, they're trying to evaluate that capital requirement. And some of them have made decisions to sell loan portfolios to free up capital that's required to be held around the mortgage servicing rights, and the buyers of those are other specialty servicers. And we've got good alignment there.","Operator","And we'll go last to Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe just to focus on the one segment that hasn't really been asked about, Employee Benefits, which I know it's a similar ROE goal as Solutions. But obviously, it's farther behind in terms of the ROE progress. Maybe from a high level, you could help us think about the trajectory of that and when we could start to thinking about getting to a 14% goal in terms of high level, and maybe more detail, then, on the immediate -- the recent rise in rates and how you think about that in terms of your reserve and discount rate, which I know is flat for this quarter.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, let me start at a high level, and then Mike can give some more detailed comments on that. But we're making a big push into the voluntary marketplace. We believe that those products are less capital-intensive than traditional disability. We've also been emphasizing dental. Again, similarly, a lower capital requirement commitment. Mike, do you want to talk about LTV?","Michael John Peninger","Yes, I think when you look at benefits, certainly in the near term, they're pressured a little bit in the disability business. We've talked about recovery rates in the small employer space. We look typically at our discount rate annually when we -- sort of in the fourth quarter, we review our reserve assumptions and things like that. We made a change last year, and we'll look at it again this quarter. But more fundamentally, I think, for benefits, I mean, we have a scale issue with benefits. They need to grow in that voluntary space, as Rob talked about. We think that's a very attractive space. We continue to believe that the work we're doing at Benefits to improve our enrollment processes and administrative support for the voluntary business is resonating with small employers and that the issues around small employers struggling with medical, and so they increasingly look to voluntary products for their -- or voluntary mechanisms for their ancillary products, we think we're gaining traction there. And we think that, that administrative and enrollment complexity is something that no one has solved, and we think we're ahead of the pack there. So we really feel good about the prospects of -- in the voluntary space for benefits going forward. So to your point, we've got to see the growth in voluntary. And hopefully, as the economy strengthens, return-to-work rates will improve, and that will help the disability. And then in dental, we've got one of the leading networks. Dental is a highly valued product among employees, and we're seeing great results there. And then we'll continue to drive toward, as with all of our businesses, optimizing the capital within employee benefits, too.","Robert B. Pollock","Thanks for joining us this morning.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2017 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday, after the market close, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter 2017 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports.","On today's call, we also will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter marked one of the most active hurricane seasons on record. This serves as an important reminder of the protection Assurant provides to millions of our customers in their time of need. We recorded nearly $300 million in reportable catastrophes from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the Mexico City earthquake. The devastation to the U.S. and in particular to the Caribbean was quite extensive and our teams mobilized quickly.","I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and unwavering commitment to serve our customers during a tough time. This is especially true for many of our employees, who were also personally affected by the various catastrophes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico.","While our third-quarter performance was impacted by these events, underlying results, excluding catastrophes, were in line with our expectations. We also made further progress toward achieving our 2017 financial commitments. For the full year, we now expect operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, to be up modestly from the $380 million recorded in 2016. Profitable growth in our fee-based capital-light offerings, a lower Corporate loss and some one-time benefits will more than offset the decline in lender-placed and legacy businesses.","In 2018 and beyond, we'll be focused on leveraging our expertise and leadership positions in the housing and lifestyle markets to drive profitable growth. Two weeks ago, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire The Warranty Group, a premier provider of extended service contracts for $2.5 billion from TPG Capital. This transaction represents another important milestone in our transformation journey.","The Warranty Group's focus alliance well with ours and will help enhance our position as a leading lifestyle provider with significant operating synergies in a more predictable and diversified earnings stream.","In addition, the acquisition accelerates our ability to capitalize on trends within our expanding lifestyle business and deepens our footprint and product offerings in key international markets. During the past few years, we've not only strengthened our business portfolio, but have also continued to deepen our management bench.","Earlier this week, we welcomed Carey Roberts to Assurant as our new Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Carey is a 20-year insurance industry veteran and will succeed Bart Schwartz, who will be retiring after 10 years with the company. I want to thank Bart for his dedication and service and wish him all the best.","Let me now review some business highlights from the third quarter, beginning with Global Lifestyle. We are pleased by continued sales momentum in our lifestyle businesses as we further leverages (05:01) our deep capabilities globally.","During the quarter, we launched a new mobile device protection program with KDDI, the second largest mobile carrier in Japan with more than 49 million subscribers. This relationship strengthens our presence in this critical postpaid mobile market. New relationships like this, along with the planned acquisition of The Warranty Group, will help advance our position as a leading provider in the Global Lifestyle market with an attractive product and client portfolio, diversified growth profile and deeper global footprint.","Now, let's look at Global Housing. In our multi-family housing business, revenue growth was strong, reflecting continued expansion within our affinity partners and property management companies in the U.S. We also recently signed an agreement with a leading e-commerce client to provide our insurance offering for small partial shipments in the U.S. and Europe. This builds on our acquisition of Shipsurance in early 2016 and we are excited to expand our book of business with this important client.","Growth in multi-family housing, partially offset declines in lender-placed and in mortgage solutions, where we continue to see soft market conditions in field services and the valuations business. We have implemented various expense management efforts across Global Housing to help temper declines.","Now, let's review our performance to-date against the key financial measures we use to track our progress, net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity, all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of such events.","Through the first nine months of this year, our net operating income was up modestly in comparison to the same period last year as the increased contribution from Connected Living and a lower loss at Corporate more than offset the continued normalization of lender-placed.","Operating earnings per share increased 15% to $5.64, driven by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10.7%, level with the full-year 2016. As of the end of September, our holding company capital totaled $570 million with $320 million available for deployment.","Over the last seven quarters, we've returned over $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 90% of our stated commitment. We expect to return the remaining $160 million through buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to 2018, we'll be focused on delivering profitable growth and the successful integration of The Warranty Group.","From a capital management perspective, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend as we have every year since our IPO subject, as always, to board approval. In addition, we expect share repurchases will continue, albeit, at a more moderate pace than in recent years as we set aside the funds needed to complete our acquisition of Ike, an assistance company in Latin America, where we currently have a 40% ownership stake.","Overall, we believe our attractive business portfolio, innovative offerings and strong client partnerships will deliver greater and more diversified earnings. This should result in strong cash flow generation and allow for greater flexibility in capital deployment over time.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our third quarter results in greater detail. Richard?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. The segment reported a net operating loss of $110 million, driven by $187 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the Mexico City earthquake. This compares to $33 million of catastrophe losses in the third quarter of last year. The ongoing lender-placed normalization also drove the decline and was partially offset by $5 million of income from a real estate joint venture partnership.","Looking at our key metrics, the combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased to 155%, reflecting catastrophes in the quarter. Excluding the losses and reinstatement premiums, the combined ratio was 81%, roughly in line with the prior-year period. Declining lender-placed premiums were offset by lower expenses to support the business. The pre-tax margin for our fee-based capital-light businesses decreased to 9%. This represents a 70 basis point decline from the prior-year period. This was mainly from $7 million of catastrophe losses and higher non-catastrophe losses within our multi-family housing business.","Mortgage solutions results improved modestly due to prior expense actions, but remained soft overall, given the continued weak market demand for originations and field services. While we continue to manage our expense base, we expect the margin pressure to persist as we exit 2017.","Turning to revenue, third-quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 8%. This was primarily due to a 31 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate and additional reinsurance premiums largely for reinstatements. Growth in multi-family housing and premiums for new lender-replaced clients partially offset the decline.","The placement rate in the quarter was impacted by macro trends in client mix, including a higher concentration of loans with lower-than-average placement rates. With these loans now fully on-boarded, we expect the placement rate decline to moderate in the fourth quarter and into 2018.","Moving to our fee-based capital-light businesses, multi-family housing revenue increased 14% during the third quarter. This reflects growth in renters policies sold through our affinity and PMC channels. In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 24% year-over-year and down 3% from second quarter 2017, primarily related to weaker market demand and lower client volume for origination and field services.","Consistent with our outlook for full-year 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. This is due to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed and continued weak performance in mortgage solutions. While the Atlantic hurricane season officially ends later this month, we expect the losses from the California wildfires to be a reportable catastrophe event in the fourth quarter. We continue to monitor claims development and expect losses could be $6 million to $8 million pre-tax.","Now, let's move to Global Lifestyle. This segment recorded a $43 million of net operating income, an increase of $14 million from the prior period. This was driven by a one-time $10 million tax benefit, growth in our mobile business and additional joint venture real estate partnership income. This was partially offset by $5 million in losses, primarily in our vehicle protection business from flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey. Revenue for this segment overall decreased, entirely due to a $139 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the previously-mentioned change in a client program structure.","The change implemented late last year extended our relationship with the client and had no impact on economics. Excluding this change, revenues for Global Lifestyle were up $53 million or 7%, driven by growth in mobile globally, vehicle protection and our Canadian credit business. This was partially offset by the declines from legacy retail clients. Fee income within Global Lifestyle, specifically, was up 11%, driven by growth in new mobile programs and subscribers.","In the quarter, however, we saw lower-than-expected volumes of trade-in activity, following the staggered introduction of new smartphone devices. Given the anticipated availability of these new devices, we expect trade-in volumes in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter with a more meaningful increase in early 2018.","The vehicle protection business generated 7% growth in revenue year-over-year as strong sales growth from prior-year periods begins to earn. Our strong returns and expanded profitability in this business over the last several years has been supported by a comprehensive product and service offering as well as broad distribution. Our alignment with key PPAs and OEMs in North America and other selected countries in Latin America have also contributed to our success.","Looking at the key performance metrics for this segment, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, rose by 130 basis points to 99%. This was primarily driven by vehicle protection losses from Harvey. Absent this, the combined ratio was 96.6%, well within our targeted range of 96% to 98%.","The pre-tax margin for our fee-based Connected Living business rose to 3.8%, up 1.2 percentage points from last year. Approximately 70 basis points was related to the change in the program structure referenced earlier. The balance was due to growth in mobile programs and subscribers, partially offset by lower service contract results and additional expenses to support new business.","Turning to our Global Lifestyle outlook for the full-year 2017, while mobile trade-in volumes in the fourth quarter may be lower than originally anticipated, we continue to expect 2017 segment earnings to meaningfully increase year-over-year. We also believe that we will be well-positioned to drive sustained growth in 2018.","Now, let's review results in Global Preneed. Earnings decreased $2 million to $12 million, primarily reflecting real estate joint venture partnership income in the prior period. Otherwise, results were flat. While assets continued to grow, yields remained pressured in the low interest-rate environment.","Total revenue for Preneed increased by 3%, driven largely by growth with our U.S. and Canadian business, including our Final Need product.","New face sales, this quarter, decreased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes. This was in key markets like Texas and Florida, the areas hit hardest by the hurricane activity. While disappointing, we do not expect lower sales will impact our ability to deliver on our commitments for the year.","Moving to Corporate, net operating loss decreased by $4 million to $13 million. Lower expenses and reduction in taxes drove the decline. We expect lower taxes in third quarter to reverse in the fourth quarter. We also expect Corporate's fourth quarter results to include an increase in expenses, driven by additional third-party consulting spend in technology and other expenses as we continue to align our operating model. As such, we now estimate our Corporate net operating loss for this year to be within the $55 million to $60 million range compared to $71 million in 2016.","Moving on to Corporate, we ended the quarter with approximately $320 million in deployable capital. Because of the significant level of catastrophes, we only received $4 million in dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed in the third quarter. We upstreamed $38 million from health and employee benefits or $124 million year-to-date. This is well ahead of our initial fee full-year estimate of $100 million. We continue to expect dividends from operating segments to roughly approximate segment earnings for the full year.","During the third quarter, we returned $63 million to shareholders with $34 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $29 million through common stock dividends. Buybacks through September were lower due to cat activity and the pending announcement of The Warranty Group acquisition.","To summarize, we continue to make good progress in the third quarter and we delivered solid results. We are developing a comprehensive integration plan for acquisition of The Warranty Group to ensure we operate as one company day one. We also are beginning to prepare our S-4 filing, including pro forma financials, which we expect to be filed by year-end. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.","With that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Your first question comes from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. The Corporate outlook, the loss of $55 million to $60 million, am I right through nine months that number is $34 million, implying (19:18) Q4 is say roughly $20 million to $25 million in loss, is that correct?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, Mark. It's Richard. You're exactly right. As I mentioned in my remarks, as we move through Q4, we actually see that some of the tax benefit that we've gotten through the course of the year will reverse itself and also we are foreseeing some higher expenses \u2013 further investments as we get through the fourth quarter. So, that is our best estimate as of today.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","When I (19:50). And in the context of kind of your broader guidance, I think your outlook is that you'll be modestly ahead of last year on an operating earning basis. Last year, I think, was $380 million, excluding cats, $313 million year-to-date. So that \u2013 the delta between those two and modestly ahead would suggest you're a bit off the pace in fourth quarter compared to what you've done year-to-date. The Corporate certainly is a little higher in the fourth quarter.","When we think about the other businesses and we only think about the Lifestyle and Housing, I think you've suggested that the mobile programs, the volumes are a bit less than you had looked for, but 4Q maybe will be similar to 3Q. Is there some reason why those operating businesses will be taking a step down in the fourth quarter or is this mostly a Corporate phenomenon?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, Mark, a couple things just to look at as you reflect on our full year. I think the positive is we're now comfortable saying we're going to be up modestly versus last year's $380 million. That is something we haven't had a comfort saying until now, but there were a couple things that have happened year-to-date that are not going to continue in Q4.","So, we had a tax benefit of $10 million in the third quarter. We had some real estate joint venture income. And then, the newer development has just been with the staggered release of the new smartphones in the market. We had expected some pickup in Q4. We now think that's going to be more Q1 and the Q4 will look more like Q3 in terms of the trade-in activity in mobile. But I don't think \u2013 if you look at our health of our underlying businesses, we still feel good and we feel well-positioned for a profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And I think if you took out that tax benefit and the joint venture income, you'd still have operating earnings roughly $95 million in the quarter and the guidance of $380 million minus $313 million year-to-date is \u2013 we don't know exactly what modestly up is, but that implies a somewhat lower number. I guess your message is that we know exactly what you're saying on (22:18) Corporate, but the underlying business sounds like you don't see any change Q3 to Q4 that you would highlight?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","It's Richard. I guess, yeah, I think you're framing it well. I think that, as Alan said, we do have the joint venture real estate income that came through the one-time tax benefit. So, as we back out that, we also know that we have the continued normalization with lender-placed business. So, as we project that forward, we see that coming against us a little bit in Q4, but moderating, as we said, as we go into Q4 and then to next year. And then, mobile volumes, obviously, being more consistent with Q3 and then picking up more in early 2018. And again, your first question on Corporate, that's a little bit of an offset too.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, on the mobile, could you give a little more detail on what you're seeing? Is this specific plans with vendors? I know Apple has \u2013 there's been a lot of news out there on that front. What else are you seeing that gives you confidence next year is going to be stronger in mobile?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Well, I think a couple things. It's important (23:34) to reflect on this year, we've had several new major clients that we've announced and added to our portfolio. I mentioned KDDI on this call. Every time we do that, in the short term, that actually impacts earnings negatively. They're spending to ramp up those programs, but if you look at those programs as we get into 2018, many of the ones we announced earlier this year and in this quarter will start to meaningfully contribute. So that, that I think is a good underlying health in our business.","And then, just in terms of the shipments, I think it's well publicized. There're some delays and some timing issues related to some of the new smartphones. Doesn't change our ultimate benefit from those new smartphones eventually coming into our trade-in and buyback programs, but it just delays the timing into more early next year as opposed to more of a 2017 event.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, if you might indulge me thinking about the next year, your guidance has been \u2013 generally, this idea that operating income would be up modestly and then share buybacks would allow you to generate double-digit EPS growth, I know you've suggested the pace of buybacks probably not as aggressive this year, how should we think about the 2018 in the context of some of these longer-term goals that you've set? If we do see a little pickup in mobile in 2018, I think the mortgage solutions, you'll have kind of gotten past the refi, the tough comps that you've been facing last couple of quarters. How should we think about 2018?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. So, Mark, as we normally do, we'll give you a good perspective on 2018 with our fourth quarter earnings call in February. I think all I'm comfortable saying at this point is we feel well positioned to grow profitably next year.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Alan B.

Our strategy to focus on growth in four targeted areas is working despite continued economic headwinds.  We continued to return capital to shareholders via dividends and repurchase.  Our activity demonstrates the long term value we believe our shares represent at current prices.","We are pleased with our performance against the three important financial metrics we've highlighted before.  First, we reported an annualized operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI of 14.4% for the quarter.  This includes $19 million of income from real estate joint ventures, and $10 million of losses from reportable catastrophes.  Year-to-date, annualized results stand at 14.6%.","Second, growth in book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was 5.3% during the quarter.  This brings the year-to-date growth to 9%.","Third, revenue defined by net earned premiums and fee income grew by over 2% year-over-year to $1.9 billion.  Year-to-date, the increase is 1.9%.","Now let me comment on the businesses.  In Solutions, despite a challenging retail sales environment, our business continued to grow through the addition of new clients.  We were pleased to announce our mobile protection program will be offered to T-Mobile's 4G pre-paid customers.  In combination with Telefonica and the Sprint tablet program, it demonstrates our ability to find creative solutions for clients and consumers in this fast growing segment.","In international operations, we saw a modest improvement in our combined ratio.  We continue to monitor European results carefully given the economic uncertainty in that region.","In Specialty Property, we continued to see growth in both multi-family housing products and lender placed insurance.  While the overall inventory of mortgage loans again declined modestly, we continued to add new loan portfolios.","The programs and activities to prevent property foreclosures have caused our coverage to remain in effect far longer than we have seen historically or expected.  As these loans resolve through foreclosure and short sale, which could accelerate, our premiums and earnings will decline.","Lender placed returns will be lower than in the past, but as a specialty business, they will continue to be attractive.  After Mike reviews the financial highlights for the quarter, I'll provide additional details and an update on the actions underway in our lender placed business.","Assurant Health continues to make great progress in the post-reform environment.  Health is offering affordable choice products for consumers, expanding distribution, and reducing operating expenses.  As medical costs continue to increase, we believe consumers will find our affordable choice plans even more attractive.  We are seeing the number of individuals covered under our programs growing.","At Assurant Employee Benefits, net operating income improved as all product lines had favorable experience.  Our new agreement with United Concordia announced in June will expand our dental network, which is now one of the largest in the industry.  Our growth priority at Benefits is on voluntary products, which represented more than half of our sales for the quarter.","Overall, we were pleased with our results, and believe we are well positioned.","And with that, I'll turn it to Mike for more comments in the second quarter.","Mike Peninger","Thanks, Rob.  I'll discuss a few second quarter highlights and priorities for each of our businesses starting with Assurant Solutions.","During the second quarter, Solutions growth and net earned premiums and fees was led by Latin America and our domestic service contract business.  The international combined ratio improved slightly versus the second quarter of 2011 after adjusting for non-recurring client settlement payments.  The improvement was primarily due to better European underwriting results.","We previously announced a lot of a domestic mobile client.  We now know that this contract, which accounted for about $100 million of annualized earned premiums will end on October 1st, 2012.  As Rob mentioned, we are very pleased to add new accounts, which will begin the process of replacing the lost business.","Solutions remains very focused on achieving an annual return on equity of at least 14% by 2014.  Up from what's currently running at about 10.5% excluding disclosed items.","In this quarter's financial supplement, we've included additional information as an exhibit on page 23 to give you more insight into Solutions domestic, international, and pre-need returns.","Reaching the 14% ROE goal requires growth as well as rigorous expense control.  The main drivers will be our ability to grow our mobile business and improve profitability in Europe.  We also expect to be able to grow our pre-need and domestic service contract products while maintaining their attractive margins.","Specialty Property results in the second quarter were strong.  We added a new under placed client, saw our existing clients expand, and continued to see increased placement rates year-over-year.  Reportable catastrophe losses of $9.8 million this quarter were down substantially compared to the second quarter of 2011 as was our non-catastrophe loss ratio due to less severe spring weather.","During the quarter, we on boarded the 2.1 million new loans we announced in the first quarter.  These will begin to produce premiums in the third quarter.  An additional 275,000 loans will be added in the third quarter due to a loan portfolio acquisition by one of our Specialty servicer clients.  Since these policies will be flat cancelled, they will also begin producing premiums in the third quarter.","Placement rates remain elevated reflecting experience on seriously delinquent loans.   As the market resolves the backlog of delinquencies, placement rates will decline and reduce premiums and their contribution to our earnings.","Our lender placed products currently account for about 70% of Specialty Properties premiums.  And in the first six months of 2012, they accounted for just under 90% of the segment's income.  Their percentage of total income can vary significantly depending on catastrophe experience and other factors.","We saw a good progress in our multi-family housing products, which achieved double digit growth in net earned premiums and fees.  The results of our SureDeposit acquisition continued to exceed our purchase assumptions.","Assurant Health benefited from $13.9 million of after-tax real estate joint venture investment income.  Results were strong even without this income as the business continued to focus on reducing operating expenses and expanding distribution.","Loss ratios declined due to favorable loss experience and a change in product mix as affordable choice plans become a bigger proportion of the business.","Second quarter expenses were down year-over-year by $12.9 million as we continue to streamline operations and improve our service to customers and agents.","Sales of supplemental products improved as more consumers expanded their health insurance coverage.","Individual market sales were up slightly as we continued to execute our network partnership with Aetna.","Small group sales continued to be slow as small employers remain cautious about changing carriers while the market adapts to healthcare reform.","Health had an excellent first half of the year.  Going forward, certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will make the business more challenging, but we are very encouraged by our progress.","At Assurant Employee Benefits, net operating income improved in all major product lines driven by very favorable loss experienced in disability and $1.9 million of after-tax real estate joint venture investment income.","While we were pleased to see improvement in our recoveries this quarter, we caution that incidents and recovery rates can be volatile from quarter to quarter.  The disability environment remains difficult and maintaining this quarter's level of claim recoveries will be challenging.","Our dental experience improved this quarter continuing the trend of the past two years.  Life results were also good during the second quarter driven by favorable mortality.","Earned premium decreased due to the previously announced loss of two assumed disability clients.","Overall sales were down 2% as increases in dental sales were offset by decreases in life and disability sales.","Our strategic focus on partnering with key brokers and our expanded product offerings continue to improve voluntary sales.","Moving on to corporate matters, we ended the quarter with $632 million in total holding company capital after returning $180 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.","During the second quarter, we took more than $183 million in dividends from our operating companies.  And we expect our full year 2012 operating company dividends to at least equal operating company earnings.  We believe our shares are a compelling buy at the current price.  And expect to continue our share repurchases during the second half of the year.  Though as always, our decisions around capital deployment will reflect a number of factors including our risk exposure and experience during hurricane season.","Our investment portfolio continues to perform well.  We reported $29.8 million in pre-tax income during the quarter from two real estate joint venture partnerships.  These investments demonstrated our continuing to find value in this specialized asset collapse.","Our low turnover investment strategy has helped us maintain yields.  But like all insurers, we will continue to see yields decline in the current interest rate environment.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Rob.","Rob Pollock","Thanks, Mike.  Since our first quarter earnings call, regulatory attention on the lender placed industry has escalated.  We welcome the dialog and understand the benefits that greater clarity on these matters will provide.","There is no single industry issue of greater priority for Assurant.  We take to heart our responsibility as the industry leader in lender placed insurance.  That is why we are pursuing every opportunity to share our best practices, offer ideas to improve the product and processes, and incorporate input from regulators.","The on-going mortgage crisis in the U.S. continues to cause problems and concerns for many homeowners.  But even during the crisis, it has been widely recognized that lender placed insurance serves an important role in helping the mortgage industry to operate more effectively.  Lender placed products provide protection when voluntary coverage lapses or is unavailable to the borrower.","Insuring that appropriate insurance maintained on properties is critical.  Perhaps more so than at any other time in the history of the industry.  Today, we want to share as much information as we can about actions we are taking to insure that Assurant remains the leader in lender placed insurance and the current status of regulatory discussions.","Let me begin with the actions we have underway.  To meet the changing needs of the lending and housing industries, we are working with regulators to introduce a next generation lender placed product to address some of the unanticipated issues that have developed during the housing crisis.  This product will combine flexibility and best practices to address the concerns of various parties including expanded geographic ratings within each state to further differentiate rates for properties more exposed to catastrophe damage from those where the risk is lower.  Adding premium rated flexibility from deductible options that can be modified based on factors such as coverage amount and delinquency status.  And continued enhancements to our already extensive customer notification process to make it absolutely clear to borrowers when they have lender placed insurance.","As a proven leader with the systems and capacity to provide unique servicing capabilities for millions of loans, we want help set the pace for a comprehensive next generation lender placed solution.  This is a message we are sharing with our clients as well as policy makers and regulators.","Let's move to updates on our discussions.  At the national level, we have had several productive conversations with the staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  We have shared details of our operation and the practices we currently follow along with additional ideas for improvement.  By September of this year, the CFPB expects to issue proposed regulations resulting from Dodd-Frank, which will address lender placed insurance disclosures as well as other servicing issues.","We've met with the FHFA, Fannie Mae, and Freddy Mac to understand their views and have provided detailed analysis and recommendations for lender placed programs.  We've continued to speak with Fannie Mae regarding the RFP issued earlier this year.  Based on our discussions with the GSE's, the FHFA, and the mortgage servicers, we believe we can help create a sustainable solution that meets the needs of all interested parties.","In August, we will participate in the public forum on lender placed insurance being held by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners as part of its' annual summer meeting.  We will join other industry experts to explain the important role lender placed insurance plays in safeguarding both homeowners and investors.","At the state level, in California, we have made the reflective rate filings and have continued our dialog with the Department of Insurance about our proposed rates.  While we originally expected a decision in July regarding our filing, this process is now expected to take a little longer.  And at this time, we do not expect a final approval until September.","In New York, we have submitted our next generation product and met with the Department of Financial Services since the May hearings.  With their input, we believe we can tailor a new lender placed program to address specific issues pertaining to New Yorkers.","As I hope is clear, there is an enormous amount of work underway.  We recognize that all the changes and ultimately a more normal housing market will mean that our lender placed revenues will decline.  And so too will our profits in this business.  But we believe the returns though lower than recent years will  continue to be attractive.  The Specialty Property team in engaged at every level.  We are doing everything possible to initiate in dialog with regulators, provide value to mortgage servicers, protect homeowners and investors, and insure we remain the recognized leader in the lender placed industry.","No one in the industry has the expertise, market presence, and operational capabilities to was Assurant's lender placed team does.  Every day, we help homeowners and mortgage servicers by providing exceptional levels of quality and efficiency.","And with that, we can move into the Q and A portion of the call.  Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, sir.  (Operator instructions).  And our first question comes from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning.","Rob Pollock","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Rob, thanks so much for those additional comments.  Regarding, I guess, the product change, is this a proactive decision, or sort of a directive decision?  And then, in terms of the delayed response from California, has there been sort of back and forth discussions between you and them, or are you just waiting for a response on their part?","Rob Pollock","Sure, so you know, I think in context, Chris, we have been looking and recognize that there have just been changes in cause by the housing crisis, and we are trying to take steps to adapt, and it\u2019s things that we have been working on for a period of time to do that.  So, you know, I think we\u2019ve been proactive \u2013 you know, things always take a little longer than you would like them to take, but it\u2019s things that we\u2019ve been working on for a while.  You know, the \u2013 all the things that we look at I think are set up to address and provide flexibility to a variety of different things we\u2019ve seen as well as having been provided from, you know, the GSE\u2019s, the regulator\u2019s, et cetera.  We\u2019re trying to take, you know, all of those into account, and unfortunately, I think, you\u2019ve got a new [inaudible] with the flexibility to do that.  You know, with California, you know, again, we are engaged in the process, I just think it\u2019s just taken a bit longer than we thought, but I don\u2019t think there is anything you should read into the fact that, you know, it\u2019s been moved back a bit.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and then the additional disclosure within solutions \u2013 I mean, I think they are very helpful.  The international piece, I guess, is sort of the one area that obviously doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s earning the type of ROE\u2019s that you guys would like, and you have clearly indicated a focus on improving that area.  But through this and you\u2019re confidence given some of the pressures we are seeing in Europe in terms of one, growth, and then two, improving the international combine ration?","Rob Pollock","Right, I can take a shot at that, Chris.  I think when we think at internal, clearly we are focused on Europe as being the most challenging from a growth stand point given the economic issues there.  We have seen, you know, excellent growth over time in Latin America and Canada.  So, you now, our international businesses is a blend of all of those places, so we have added new clients.  The improvement that is going to drive that international ROE up is, I think, you know, disproportionately going to come from Europe as we continue to address the underwriting and pricing issues there, and hopefully add some new clients.  We are very focused on getting some clients in our target areas, but if that doesn\u2019t happen then we\u2019ll take the necessary actions on the expense side.  So, yes, I just add to that, Chris, because I think that was an excellent summary Mike provided.  Remember our near term goal was to get the UK to break even by mid \u201913 \u2013 we\u2019ve got a business that is dragging IOE there, and that\u2019s step one in correcting that overall, and that will help quite a bit.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks, I will get back in the cue.","Rob Pollock","Yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James and Associates.","Rob Pollock","Good morning, Steven.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Hey, good morning everybody \u2013 a few questions here.  It was mentioned that you\u2019ve got a new portfolio coming on in the lender place business \u2013 275,000 new loans \u2013 that\u2019s a flat cancel.  Did you mention what the placement rate is on that?","Rob Pollock","I don\u2019t believe we did, but I think the important point is the one that you hit on that will be a flat cancel versus un-renewal, and we\u2019re going to see premium producing in that portfolio in the third quarter, Steven.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Right.","Rob Pollock","And we\u2019ll have a good idea on what, you know, the placement rate will look like, because we haven\u2019t boarded those loans yet.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Okay, so \u2013 all right.","Rob Pollock","You know, I think in contrast we\u2019ve boarded 2.1 million loans, but \u2013 and they show up in our totals, but those are going to produce business on renewal, and because we have boarded them, we have an idea that their placement rate will be in that 1% range.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Right, yes, okay \u2013 so, that is the number that you gave first quarter.  Okay, and then moving on, Rob, you made a statement, ACA \u2013 some ACA regs coming on board will make the second half more challenging.  Could you detail what those are?","Rob Pollock","Sure, actually Mike made the comment, and I will let him talk about it.","Mike Peninger","PPACA has got some provisions relating \u2013 primarily relating around experience credibility, Steven \u2013 you know, you\u2019ve got in our \u2013 remember the MLR calculation is state-by-state and legal entity-by-legal entity, so, there\u2019s an enormous number of sells in that calculation and there is credibility factors in the calculation.  If you have a relatively small amount of premium in any cell, and so that has an impact on \u2013 if your experience is better, you get the benefit of that to a certain extent when it is not credible, but as the PPACA, as the years go on, their provisions in the law where the credibility adjustment changes making the target, the MLR requirement higher.   So, sorry if \u2013 it\u2019s a relatively complicated calculation, hopefully that is a little bit clearer.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Yes, it is.","Rob Pollock","But on that business, the important thing to remember that \u2013 Mike lead to this, we\u2019re ultimately going to have to \u2013 our margins have got to come out of the difference between the loss ratio that we need to provide and the premium that we collect, and that will be bound on what we can learn.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Right, right \u2013 and then, one more and then I will get back in the cue as well.  Mike, the recoveries were good in DI, how is incidents in the quarter?","Mike Peninger","Incidents has remained pretty stable for us, you know, we have seen that trend in the recent couple of years, Steven, that our incident has remained relatively stable, it\u2019s been the recovery that has been more of a challenge for us over time, and we have very good experience this quarter.  I just reiterate what I said that results on the recoveries particularly can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","For our next question we\u2019ll move to Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","Rob Pollock","Morning Mark.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Good morning, I have a few.  I guess you mentioned that the CFPB should have something out in September, I\u2019m just curious is it your view that based on the discussions you\u2019ve held with them that is will have fundamental changes in how this business is operated?","Rob Pollock","Remember this CFPB is very focused on the RESPA guidelines Steven\u2026","Rob Pollock","Right, which, you know, may well influence how servicers present information etcetera.  I think it\u2019s fundamentally going to be around disclosures and we feel pretty good that our disclosures are good and we have some ideas on how to make them better.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","You know, New York and California the two very public states, can you just give us a feel for what\u2019s kind of happening in some other states, for example, Florida or other states that maybe aren\u2019t quite as public as New York and California in terms of the lender placed business and rate filings?","Rob Pollock","Sure we have regular filings and discussions with all the different states over time.  I think we\u2019ve tried to highlight the issues where we\u2019re having discussions around rate right now.  So I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon particularly in Florida.  You know, we certainly have the issues where lender place is going to be discussed at the NAIC meetings.  We welcome that opportunity because we think it will be an opportunity for all parties to present how the product works, the essential nature of the product, and it\u2019ll allow us to show how we\u2019ve been an innovator in other areas of the lender placed industry at prior times.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Maybe just moving on, to go back to I think it was Chris\u2019s question, on the international OR we have 2%, you have the profit strain of the UK and some other underperforming businesses, you also have investment spend in Latin America and Asia, wherever \u2013 how do you think about that path of 2% and how much is contributed from, in terms of getting to double digit returns or getting to double digit returns?  What is the path in terms of the pieces of the business that are underperforming versus kind of the investment spend starting to subside?","Rob Pollock","Okay, Mike you want to start?","Mike Peninger","Well I think again Mark we\u2019ve got the issues in Europe that we\u2019re very focused on.  There we have targeted sales efforts that vary , you know, targeted areas.  Mobile, for example.  And we\u2019re looking at expenses very closely in conjunction with that.  So to the extent we\u2019re able to find clients in those targeted areas that\u2019s great, that will help us, and we\u2019ll get some growth there.  To the extent the growth isn\u2019t there then we need to address expenses in Europe.  And so those are the primary focus in Europe, where growth is the most challenging for us.  In Latin America, we\u2019ve  added new clients and there to your point we have added some, made investments in expenses to build up the capability to service that business.  And remember also that we\u2019ve got, to the extent that we sell service contracts, we\u2019ve got the delayed nature of the revenue recognition because we don\u2019t recognize revenue on extended services contracts until the manufacturer\u2019s warranty wears off. So that business is going to slowly ramp up there and so the challenge in Latin America then is to keep finding those new clients and then start to leverage that infrastructure that we\u2019ve built there.  So I think those are kind of the main things that I\u2019d point to.","Rob Pollock","Yes, I think that the Latin America situation if you turn and look at China, China we\u2019ve had pure investment for a number of years.  We announced the five star deal, it\u2019s mostly service contract business, but we now have what we believe is an embedded set of contracts on the business that are going to earn in the future.  And I think Mike detailed how we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on that in Latin America, we now have that going on in China as well.  So we have some very developed markets, Canada and Puerto Rico.  We have LatAm that we\u2019re making lots of progress on.  We\u2019ve got Europe that we\u2019ve got to get first and we\u2019ve got China that I think is also going to start being a future add to our earning.  So I think that we\u2019ve got every one of these buckets moving in a positive direction in that international area.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take a question from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","Rob Pollock","Good morning, John.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Good morning, Rob.  Good morning, Mike.  A couple of questions.  So all these conversations with the, boy it sounded like so much alphabet soup, but with the GSE that you\u2019ve been having, I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us any sense for where things may be headed there.  For instance, I\u2019ve heard that there have been some discussions about the GSE\u2019s potentially taking on near REO properties in addition to the already fully foreclosed properties that we know they already self-insure.  I was wondering if you had any thoughts on that.","Rob Pollock","Well I think the big thing as we\u2019ve talked to the different people, John, is just getting an alignment among of the GSE.  You know, the FHFA kind of is the regulator over both of those, if you will, or sets direction over both.  And I think the first thing they\u2019re looking to do is just, how do we get alignment and make sure some consistency is going on here.  You know, I think that we\u2019ve got a lot of unique capabilities that can help them with whatever solution they want to land on.  And we\u2019ve proposed a number of things to do that in terms of sitting down and showing them things we might do.  So I think the real key is for them to just decide what they want to do and we\u2019re trying to help them in that process.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay, along those lines, Rob, in terms of some of the potential solutions of ways that it could change, I wonder do you think there\u2019s any real potential that Assurant could be an insurance provider, you know, for the GSEs?  I know they\u2019ve been self-insuring now for at least the history that I know about.  I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a chance that that could shift?","Rob Pollock","Well it\u2019s certainly something we\u2019re trying to talk to them about historically.  I think they\u2019re focused on other things right now, John, so we don\u2019t want to give up on that, but I wouldn\u2019t put that as probably as what we\u2019ve seen as the top of their list.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay, and then separately but still related to lender place, I\u2019m just wondering given the New York division seems so focused on the re-insurance arrangements with you servicer clients and it seems \u2013 I think, if memory serves, JP Morgan at the hearing indicated that they reinsure 75% of the premiums in your contract.  I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s been any movement toward terminating those re-insurance arrangements?","Rob Pollock","So again, we don\u2019t disclose particulars of relationship with clients.  All the deals are unique.  That would require, you know, JP Morgan saying they want to do something different John.  As it relates to the department itself, remember we\u2019ve had our discussions, there were others who were at the hearing, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve had discussions, but we\u2019ve not been privy to any of those.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee ","Okay, so would it be your expectation that ultimately re-insurance arrangements are terminated or\u2026","Rob Pollock","I wouldn\u2019t speculate on that.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay.  And then finally turning to health, I mean, obviously a terrific quarter even if we take out the real estate income.  It looks like sort of achieving 4% or darn close to it, 4% after tax margin and north of 15% ROE.  You know, Mike you mentioned in your opening remarks some additional provisions that were going to be coming on from the reform that might mean that this level of earnings is not necessarily sustainable.  Could you just give us a little bit more help in understanding what\u2019s coming on in the near terms and how much of a pullback in earnings we should expect before we ramp back towards that 4%?","Rob Pollock","Mike can give the details, but I want to go back and just provide a little color here.  John, remember what we\u2019ve said is we think we can get to that 4% after tax margin once PPACA is fully implemented, which is after 2014.  We said along the way we have a lot to do, but we can make progress as we go there.  But understand the way that the PPACA legislation implements on a year-by-year basis.  We\u2019ve got to make progress and the legislation will push back at things a little bit, so we\u2019ll have that to overcome.  So again, I want to put it in the broad context of I think we\u2019re quite pleased with the progress we\u2019re making, but we\u2019ve got more progress to make.  And then Mike, you want to talk about the\u2026","Mike Peninger","Yes, maybe in a little more \u2013 I mentioned the credibility issues earlier John, but if you look at our loss ratio this quarter, I think it was in 73% kind of range in health.  And if you think about, I think we\u2019ve talked on past calls, this idea that the MLR is 80% and that translates into something lower than that on a gap basis because gap and MLR calculations are somewhat different.  But if you think about business subject to the MLR is going to run probably a little bit higher than 75%, 75, 76, 77, somewhere in that range then you\u2019ve got non-MLR business and that\u2019s where some of the affordable options that we talked about is going to run probably a bit lower loss ratio.  And when you start to look at a blend.  And then the challenge going forward relating that I referred to on the call is primarily the credibility adjustment to the extent that we have non-credible business we\u2019re currently getting the benefit of some of that lower loss ratio.  But over time we get less benefit from that as PPACA rolls out further over time.  So when you\u2019ve got to look at the blend of all these things when you think about what our loss ratio is going to be going forward.  And I think the bottom line is going to be higher than say the 73%, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s so  important that we continue to sell new sales of the non-MLR products and continue the work we\u2019re doing to ratchet down expenses, that\u2019s how we sustain the returns.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","What proportion, just as a quick follow-up, what proportion of the in-force premiums or health segment reserves, I\u2019m not sure what way you\u2019d be willing to talk about this, but what proportion of that is the newer health access, non-MLR type products, at this point.","Rob Pollock","Yes, we haven\u2019t disclosed that yet and it\u2019s relatively modest at this point because these products are starting, you know, we\u2019ve started to really focus on them the last couple of years in the post reform environment, so they\u2019re growing nicely.  But they started from sort of a small base.","Mike Peninger","But at some point in the future that is something we will figure out how to disclose.  I think the other one that just goes along with it again, is we\u2019re also pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with the networks in the comprehensive or PPACA world as well and we think we\u2019ll have more of those sales in the second half of the year too.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","That\u2019s helpful.  Solid progress in health, absolutely.  Thank you.","Operator","Next we move to Sean Dargan with Macquarie Securities for a question.","Rob Pollock","Good Morning Sean.","Sean Dargan \u2013 Macquarie Capital ","Good Morning, thank you.  In special property I realize that the revenue guidance for the year, I guess, for the year is going up. But, when we think about the steady state estimate that you put out earlier with a combined ratio of 84 to 88%, and expense ratio of 44 to 46%, is that still the way we should be thinking about this business in the out-years?","Rob Pollock","You know, that\u2019s a reasonable way to think about it. Let\u2019s just reflect for a second on all the changes we\u2019ve seen that have been caused in the last few years. Because I think it\u2019s important, and we\u2019re trying to deal with all these factors as well.  So, if you\u2019d gone back three years ago, we saw a huge consolidation of loan portfolios with the big players.  Now we\u2019re seeing a deconsolidation and move to the specialty players.  So, that\u2019s a fundamental difference that\u2019s taking place.","Second, you know, we\u2019re in a situation where delinquent loans have remained high, causing placements to be high.","Third, we\u2019ve seen voluntary carriers reducing their exposure in cap prone areas, and we\u2019re seeing out exposure in cap prone areas increase.","So, all these factors are causing us to look at the business a little bit differently then we have in the past. We do feel the big issues on resolution of these delinquent loans, and their movement to either foreclosure or short-sale is likely going to cause our revenues to come down.  I have not been very good at estimating that, via the placement rate on when that\u2019s going to happen, because it\u2019s just very difficult to predict.  But we do understand that ultimately a normalized housing market will lead the lower earnings, but we\u2019re still going to have good returns in the business.","Sean Dargan \u2013 Macquarie Capital ","Now, I realize those returns will be lower than they have been.  Can you give us any\u2026","Rob Pollock","I think we tried to provide that guidance Sean, with that look at the combined ratios. Combined ratios going to go up a little bit.  And you can think of that in a couple of different ways.","One is, you know, our other products don\u2019t have as attractive of combined ratios, as Lender- Placed Product  has had.","The second thing is, you know, some of our expenses in Lender-Placed are fixed. Our tracking system, the cost of running that tracking system are not going to go down when we have fewer policies enforced.","Sean Dargan \u2013 Macquarie Capital ","Okay, thank you.  And just a follow-up about the real estate (inaudible) I think that\u2019s the first time it showed up in a number of years.  Do you expect to see more of that in the near future?","Rob Pollock","I\u2019m going to turn it over the Chris, because I think he can provide some good collar here.","Chris Pagano","Sure, Hi Sean.  Let me make just a couple comments, because as you mentioned, we haven\u2019t talked about the real estate portfolio in quite a while.  You know, when we think about real estate, we think of it as kind of a specialty (inaudible) class for us.  And, you know, we\u2019ve been in the business for the better part of the last 20 years. It\u2019s a very small part of the portfolio.  If you look at the end of the second quarter, the book value of the real estate portfolio was a little less than $240 million. It doesn\u2019t produce consistent quarterly gap income, and you see that in the supplement. It\u2019s the main reason we don\u2019t include it when we give you investment yield calculations.","You know, the approach that we take is very Bottoms-Up opportunistic.  We don\u2019t have set timetables around acquisition and dispositions.  You know the two partnerships that made up the $29 million of income this quarter, one was in the portfolio less than two years, and the other one was in the portfolio almost twelve years.  So, what we do focus on though is, long term value, cash-on-cash return, and we\u2019ve been very successful at it over the years.","Going forward, just to give you an estimate, there\u2019s probably about $55 or $60 million of value in the current portfolio that over time we\u2019ll be able to monetize.  But there\u2019s no set timeframe around how long that\u2019s going take.  Again, we want to be opportunistic, we want to let market conditions dictate the investment strategy.","You know, the other thing to remember though is, it\u2019s cash return, $19-plus million of after tax profit came into the company last quarter, and I look at that as deployable capital, which we\u2019ll ultimately be able to get up to the holding company and use either for buy backs or to fund profitable growth opportunities.","Sean Dargan \u2013 Macquarie Capital ","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will go to Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America","Rob Pollock","Good Morning Ed.","Edward Spehar \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good morning everyone.  A few questions, I guess specifically on New York, are you going to provide us at some point do you think anytime soon in terms of what type of rate reduction or sort of targeted margins you might be thinking about on this new generation of your product?","Rob Pollock","The first thing we\u2019ve tried to do Ed, is bound the premium that will be subject to things.  I think we\u2019ve identified that as $63 million in the state of New York.  Obviously, we\u2019re having discussions and when we have resolution, we definitely will let people know where things have landed.","Edward Spehar \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Do you get any sense, like you\u2019ve given us some good detail on sort of the timeline or expectations around California, do you have anything similar that you can provide at this point for New York?","Rob Pollock","I don\u2019t believe I do Ed, but when we have something, we\u2019ll certainly provide it.","Edward Spehar \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then a related question is:  The NAIC meeting, is there any specific agenda that they have or any proposals that have been put forth by anyone to be discussed there.  Or is it pretty open ended type of\u2026","Rob Pollock","Yes, I think it\u2019s an opened forum.","Chris Pagano","Both sides will be represented in the discussions, and I think that, you know, there\u2019s just been a general interest to learn more about the Lender-Placed industry.  The good news to me is, we have a number of people within the NAIC who are quite impacted and see the need for capacity of Lender-Placed insurance, and they\u2019ll be there as well.","Edward Spehar \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, it\u2019s not like a yes or no minimum loss ratios or anything like that?","Rob Pollock","No.","Edward Spehar \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.  And then one last question; With regard to the International ROE and Solutions, can you give us any sense just roughly where that ROE would be if we thought about, you know, Europe and sort of a normal economy or economic recovery type of scenario.  Not necessarily targeted ROE\u2019s in Europe or anything else, but just if the environment was a little more normalized?","Rob Pollock","Well, I think the improvement in Europe is going to come from a combination of some combination of growth and expenses Ed.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared at this point to tell you, you know, to split the equity, the international equity, but to sort of, I think what you\u2019re asking, but we can say that the bulk of \u2013 if we think about \u2013 you can sort of see from our disclosure and do the numbers, you know, that the international ROE (inaudible)","I think previously provided the losses we had in the U.K.  I can\u2019t remember what that was, but I think we said about $35 million. Just think about that going to break even.","Edward Spehar \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, so something similar type of magnitude to that.","Rob Pollock","Right, now recognize that we\u2019ve made progress, it\u2019s not at $35 anymore, but there\u2019s still, you know, we\u2019re not going to break even till the middle of next year.","Edward Spehar \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We move now to Jeffrey Schuman with KBW.","Rob Pollock","Good Morning Jeff.","Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Good Morning, thank you.  I was wondering if you could talk a little more about some of the concepts you mentioned for the next generation Lender-Placed product.  I\u2019m a little slow, so I could use a little help there.  So, for example, the expanded geographic rating, I guess the idea is you would \u2013 the rating would be more sensitive to levels of cap exposures, is that the basic idea?","Rob Pollock","That would be one of them. I mean, I think \u2013 let\u2019s start and go back historically.  You know, this has been a very simple product, and one of the reasons for it is, we wanted to be differentiated from the voluntary market, we take all-comers, and you know the basic genesis of it was in a different time in the housing industry.  When we sit down and look at things, there are things we can do differently, and a lot of it really relates to an ability to do things in concert with our mortgage servicers.","So, for instance, we have to have interface and system capabilities to address different things.  You brought up geographic rating, and we think that\u2019s one of them.  Clearly if you look at some of our coastal areas, being able to offer different rates on the coast than inland, that certainly makes sense to us, okay.","But you can also get into, well maybe they want something else different.  May be they want deductibles that vary by the value of the home, okay, or delinquency status. These are all things we\u2019ve looked to figure out how to build into the product in response to just things we\u2019ve heard from different constituents.","Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Yes, I guess, it\u2019s not immediately clear to me. Some of this responds more to some things the servicers are looking for.  Does this somehow also address some of the regulator concerns, and if these kind of changes have an obvious directional bias to your revenues and earnings?","Rob Pollock","A couple different things: We\u2019re trying to respond to everyone, so the servicers are our clients, and first we have to have enabling capabilities to respond to what\u2019s going on. And the good news is we have the systems and infrastructure that can deal with a lot of these things, that\u2019s quite important.  In some cases the servicers may have limitations with how their systems operate to deal with things.  Then you have ideas being offered in by the (GSE\u2019s) or the regulators.  We\u2019re trying to provide a comprehensive solution that can respond to all those things.  So you know, again, when that housing market normalizes, when we put the new product out there, we know in total our earnings are going to be smaller, but our returns are still going to be good.","Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  Just one other thing: On the kind of state by state regulatory read, it sounds like outside of New York and California you\u2019re not having the same types of conversations. I\u2019m wondering if that at this point is more of a reflection that those states have reviewed the issue, and are find with the rates, or is it more the situation as we see in some cases, that the smaller department sometimes defer to leadership of California and New York and (inaudible) off the outcome there?","Rob Pollock","Again, I think let\u2019s take a starting point here.  And the starting point to me is there\u2019s a recognized kind of thought process that there\u2019s an essential need for this product.  How it prices can be debated, the need for the product is uniformed. Everyone sees that it\u2019s essential to making mortgage lending in the housing industry work.  You know, we\u2019ve had conversations with many regulars.  I could name them, I\u2019m sure.  So, that\u2019s not the point, but these are the two that are front and center, and we\u2019re trying to engage in active dialogue with them and get to a solution here, and we think the new product can be a big part of that.","Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, thanks a lot Rob.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mark Hughes with Suntrust.","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you.","Rob Pollock","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning.  I don\u2019t know if you care to throw out a number, but if you did give full credibility to some of these loss numbers in the various states, how much would that impact the overall loss ratio, say if all this was kicked in immediately?","Rob Pollock ","Yeah, I think you\u2019ve got to look at the loss ratio that we present, Mark, the 73%, as I said, you think about fully credible MLR business running somewhere at above 75%, as I said.  You know, you\u2019re going to have \u2013 our overall aggregate loss ratio is then going to be a blend of that MLR business and the non-MLR business.  So the number would move depending on the mix.","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","And then if I did all that math, where would I come up at?","Rob Pollock","I \u2013 you know, we don\u2019t have that with us right now, Mark.  I mean, we can try and look to provide further insight on that in future calls, but I think the more important thing is to remember that fully comes into effect in 2014.  So you know, as Mike pointed out, we\u2019re doing 260 calculations to calculate all the rebates because they vary by legal entity, they vary by state, small group, individual, it would take a fair amount of work to do that and we just don\u2019t have it with us right now.","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Exactly.  Understood.  And then how about the \u2013in the benefits business, any comment on underlying pricing, you know, assuming your employee count or customer count stays steady?  What are the pricing trends generally?","Rob Pollock ","I think that certainly the market is raising prices on disability, Mark, in response to the interest-rate environment and some of the challenges and incidents in recovery that various carriers are seeing.  You know, I think we probably started a little bit earlier than some others, but you know, I think the renewal rates are definitely going up.  I hesitate to put out a number, but we\u2019re getting a meaningful \u2013 meaningful increases in renewal pricing.","Mark Hughes \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you, very much.","Operator","And our last question is coming from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks so much for the follow up.  Just a question on capital management.  I guess, you know, you mentioned 380 million of deployable capital and you know, when we look back I guess over the past couple years in the periods where concerns are around sort of regulator inquires and specialty property kind of prop up, you know, going back to the fall of 2010 I guess with the banker article last summer and then you know, the second quarter of this year and you look at the corresponding activity that you guys did with share repurchases, you know, you were repurchasing 160 million, you know, at share prices and call it in the 32 to 34 range.  So when we think about sort of the pace of share repurchases going forward, should we be thinking when shares are at this level, that\u2019s the level of share buybacks we should be assuming or should we say, you know what, this is a sustainable rate just given how much deployable capital you guys currently have?","Rob Pollock","Yeah, just a quick comment.  First, we\u2019ve tried to reiterate we see the share price as very attractive.  I think Mike and I both said it, I think Chris said it too.  And you know, we tend to buy through 10B51 programs, we try and take into account the current situation when we set that 10B51 program into effect.  Chris, you want to provide a little more color there?","Chris Pagano","Yeah, I guess a couple comments.  I mean, again, when I think about share repurchase, you know, certainly buying back at current prices is a prudent use of deployable capital.  There\u2019s no question about that.  But the goal here is to be disciplined about returning capital, be in the market consistently and also as we head into CAT season, be careful about maintaining what we talked about and called a seasonal buffer.  So as we head into the wind season, we\u2019re going to probably \u2013 we\u2019re going to need to likely hold more than the 250 capital buffer that we\u2019ve talked about.","In terms of the pace or the degree at which we\u2019re buying relative to share price, you know, we\u2019re not trying to market [inaudible].  The goal and the use of the 10B51 program is to allow us to be in there consistently through blackout periods and again, returning the capital to the shareholders.","The other thing to keep in mind is that, you know, even given the significant amount of repurchase activity over the last 18 months or so, you know, shareholder\u2019s equity [inaudible] has not changed at all.  Okay?  So this is as much a cash flow profitability story as it is a repurchase story.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and then just as a quick follow up, is there anything going, I mean, a lots going on in the regulatory side, is there anything that you guys see on the horizon that could preclude you from repurchasing stock or is, you know, your 10B5 program basically diminish the risk there?","Rob Pollock","Well, the way we like to run the repurchase program is quick 10B51 program\u2019s in place to get us through blackout and we go into the next open period, we recalibrate our outlook for capital and then put another program in that will take us to the next blackout period.  Now again, keep in mind that also spans quarter end so it\u2019s difficult to link quarterly repurchase activity to the programs that we put in place.  But if we do find ourselves in an open period, blacked out for a reason other than earnings, then that\u2019s going to affect what\u2019s going on.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you very much.","Rob Pollock ","Thank you for joining us today.  We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter."],"2821":["Assurant, Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. Earlier this year, we revised the earnings release and financial supplement to focus on Housing and Lifestyle. Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments, Assurant Solutions, Specialty Property and Corporate, as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other variable items.","We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy. On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.","We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.","Now, I will turn the call over to Alan.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Overall performance for the third quarter was disappointing and fell short of our expectations. As we announced last week, the year-over-year decline in earnings was driven by increased catastrophe losses as well as lower-than-expected mobile results. However, we don't believe this quarter is reflective of the long-term potential of our Housing and Lifestyle offerings. Throughout this year, we've implemented the critical building blocks of our transformation. We've done so first by ensuring we're focused on the most attractive housing and lifestyle markets where we can achieve leadership positions and generate attractive returns; and second, by implementing a more integrated organizational framework that will enable us to become more efficient and effective.","Starting with Lifestyle, mobile and the broader connected living market offer attractive opportunities for growth. So far in 2016, we've added new partnerships and expanded our fee-based offerings across distribution channels. We're also taking steps to expand margins over time by ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide.","Critical to this is a more robust technology infrastructure that maximizes our global capabilities. Together, these actions set a stronger foundation for future profitable growth. While we no longer expect Solutions' net operating to increase this year, we remain confident that we have the right strategy, business mix and capabilities to deliver 10% average annual growth and net operating income over the long term.","Turning to Housing. We've invested in the transformation of our lender-placed platform to further strengthen our leadership position in this important market. Just this quarter, we added a total of 2.7 million loans from two new clients and the block of loans we announced last quarter. We believe these wins demonstrate our clients' recognition of our strong platform, compliance processes and superior customer service.","The severe flooding in Louisiana and Hurricane Matthew are reminders of the importance of our products to homeowners across the country. Our commitment is brought to life by the rigor and dedication of our employees as they assess damages and pay claims as promptly as possible.","To date, on behalf of Louisiana homeowners, we process more than 2,000 claims with an over 95% completion rate. In addition, we also help to administer claims for the National Flood Insurance Program as its second largest administrator.","Just this month, Hurricane Matthew inflicted severe flooding and wind damage particularly in parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and the Caribbean. Our claims field adjusters were again on site shortly after the hurricane passed through these regions to assess damage and begin processing claims.","While it's still very early, we estimate losses from Hurricane Matthew could total up to $70 million after tax. This estimate is still preliminary and we will update the market as we have a more complete view of the impact.","The wind-down of Assurant Health is moving along as scheduled and represents another key aspect of our portfolio realignment. In the third quarter, we took an additional $189 million in dividends from Health. These dividends, along with capital releases from the sale of employee benefits, give us the added flexibility to return capital to shareholders and invest in housing and lifestyle markets where we can outperform long-term.","In 2016, we also took several steps to transform our organizational model worldwide, focusing on both functional areas and our lines of business. We've now set the foundation for a global business unit structure under the leadership of Gene Mergelmeyer as our Chief Operating Officer. We're also realigning our technology, risk, strategy and finance organizations and expect to have that work completed by year end.","As part of that effort, Richard and the finance team are also evaluating our financial reporting framework. We expect changes to be implemented early next year. Our work to transform Assurant and build a strong future is on track. As we look ahead to 2017, our focus will be on profitable growth. To accomplish this, we'll continue to offer innovative products and services to meet consumer needs as well as completing the rollout of our new operating model to enhance efficiency across our global operations and we'll continue to prudently deploy capital to maximize returns.","Progress will be measured against three key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather. Through the nine months of 2016, net operating income decreased by 14% to $308 million primarily due to the expected decline of lender-placed, the loss of the tablet program and lower contributions from legacy businesses.","Operating earnings per diluted share declined 6% to $4.89 driven by the factors I noted earlier. As we execute our transformation, we expect to grow net operating income and deploy capital prudently to support average annual operating EPS growth of 15% over time. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3%. Expansion of our fee-based offerings will be an important driver to achieve our goal of 15% operating ROE by 2020.","At the end of September, holding company capital totaled $875 million after returning $783 million to shareholders through the first nine months of 2016. This return represents more than half of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017. While there is more work to do, we believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable, more diversified earnings that will continue to generate strong cash flow.","I will now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook in greater detail. Richard?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Solutions which reported earnings of $43 million. As Alan said, this was below our expectations for the quarter. Excluding a $4.5 million tax benefit in the prior-year period, earnings were down $5 million. The decrease was due to lower than expected contributions from mobile and the anticipated declines in legacy service contracts and domestic credit insurance.","Specifically, core mobile results were down by nearly $6 million year over year, largely driven by $3 million of higher technology expenses to modernize certain systems. We also realized lower mobile repair and logistics volumes as customers upgraded or traded in significantly fewer phones this quarter. Declines in legacy businesses accounted for another $3 million. These factors were partially offset by $3 million of higher real estate joint venture income.","Turning to revenue, Solutions top line increased by 3% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting fee income, growth from new mobile subscribers. Premiums were also \u2013 increased slightly year-over-year. Growth from vehicle service contracts was tempered by declines from certain North American retailers and our domestic credit business. Foreign exchange was also a factor given the depreciation of the British pound and the Argentinean peso.","For the full year 2016, we revised our outlook and now expect Solutions earnings to decline modestly from 2015. While fundamentals in our mobile business are promising, in 2016, we no longer expect growth from new and existing programs to offset declines in legacy businesses nor the loss of the tablet program. We are taking steps to help improve Solutions performance in 2017 including more rigorous expense management to generate profitable growth.","Let's now move to Specialty Property. Earnings decreased $43 million to $45 million. This is primarily due to two factors. The quarter included $33 million of reportable catastrophe losses from flooding in Louisiana and remaining $10 million related to ongoing normalization of lender-placed. As a result of the catastrophe losses, the combined ratio of our risk-based businesses increased 12 points to 92%. Absent cats, combined ratio was flat year-over-year as lower general expenses helped to offset declining lender-placed premiums.","Our fee-based, capital-light offerings that comprised multi-family housing and mortgage solutions generated a pre-tax margin of 9.7%. This was down 5.5 points from the prior-year period. The decrease was mainly driven by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses. While we believe we've grown revenues well in excess of the market, we do need to drive greater operating efficiencies across our mortgage solutions platform to deliver our margin target of 15% to 20% by 2020 for all of the property fee-based, capital-light offerings.","Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees in Specialty Property decreased 3%, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates in lender-placed, while multi-family housing and mortgage solutions increased by 16%. Diving deeper, multi-family housing revenue increased 10% from the prior year period. This reflects a higher volume of mentors' policies sold through our affinity channels and increased penetration rates across our property management network. For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 22%, including the July acquisition of American Title. Organic growth in the quarter totaled 7% due to greater production from valuation services.","Our 2016 outlook for Specialty Property is unchanged. We continue to expect lower revenue and profits, primarily reflecting the normalization of our lender-placed business. As Alan noted earlier, catastrophe losses from Hurricane Matthew will impact our fourth quarter results.","Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate a continued decline of lender-placed revenue in earnings as we move closer to a normalized steady state. The 2.7 million loans onboarded this quarter are expected to produce modest premiums next year, though not enough to offset the overall declining lender-placed market. We also expect ongoing expansion from our fee-based, capital-light offerings to account for a larger proportion of Specialty Property's results.","Turning now to Health runoff operations, results were slightly better than anticipated. The $2 million loss in the quarter reflects a slight reduction in estimated recoveries from the 2015 risk mitigation programs which were offset by favorable claims development. Results also included some severance-related costs, as well as other indirect expenses not included in the premium deficiency reserve.","Year-to-date, we received $378 million of reinsurance and risk adjustment payments related to the 2015 Affordable Care Act policies. As of September 30, around $99 million of net receivables remained on our balance sheet. We expect CMS to remit the payments for these outstanding balances in 2017. So far this year, we've brought up $338 million to the holding company and dividends from Health. We continue to expect to receive approximately a total of $475 million. Of course, the timing will depend on regulatory approval.","Moving to Corporate, the loss for the quarter decreased $9 million to $17 million. This was primarily due to lower taxes and employee benefit costs. For the full year, we still expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. Throughout the year, we've taken steps to increase efficiencies in Corporate such as freezing our pension plan.","We also recognize the need for some additional investments to support our transformation, some of which are expected to flow through Corporate in 2017. We will provide more details on our 2017 outlook for all of our operating segments on the fourth quarter earnings call in February.","Moving on to capital. We ended the third quarter with $625 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $418 million in total dividends in the third quarter, $339 million of dividends from capital previously supporting the Employee Benefits business and Health runoff operations, $79 million from Solutions and Specialty Property.","Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to do two things. We returned $266 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and we invested $11 million in emerging technologies in the mobile and rental value chains. In the first three weeks of October, we bought back an additional 742,000 shares, bringing the total number of shares repurchased year-to-date to just over 9 million.","So, to summarize, while the results were disappointing, we remain committed to executing our transformation strategy to realize our potential to ensure long-term profitable growth in Housing and Lifestyle. Finally, I do want to thank those of you who I've had a chance to meet over the last couple of months at Assurant. I appreciate all your input and support. It's made my onboarding into the company both smooth and productive.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And the floor is now opened for questions. Your first question comes from Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Good morning.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. I was hoping you could provide some more granular insight into what's going on or what happened in mobile in the quarter. It sounded like there were a couple of moving pieces in terms of \u2013 in part, elevated expenses and in part, some mix shift between either warranty upgrades or repair and logistics revenue. So I'm wondering if you could sort of give us more detail in terms of if that is in fact the case and then a sense how the revenues for each of those different businesses make up sort of the overall pie of what is considered mobile in your reporting.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","All right. Well, let me start and then I'll ask Richard to provide a little more detail. Clearly, it was a disappointing third quarter for us in mobile. However it's not reflective, we think, of the long-term potential. And if you look at the quarter at a high level, the positive was continued growth in subscribers. So, people signing up for our programs and the handset programs.","The real negative in the quarter other than the IT, which Richard will talk about, was we just had lower trade-in volumes where people are not \u2013 they didn't trade in as many phones for either an upgrade or claim or whatever it might be. And that really varies a bit quarter-to-quarter depending on our client programs, what's going on with competition and timing of new phone introductions availability. So disappointing, but I think forward progress. But you want to go a little deeper on the quarter, Richard?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Sure and good morning, Michael. Yeah, to peel it back a little bit and really to go over what I just mentioned in my remarks, if we look year-to-year, Q3 to Q3, we're down about $9 million. If you take off the previous year tax, that leaves us to about $6 million. And within that, as Alan said, we were down about $3 million, let's say, for repair and logistics. And again, this is \u2013 we were just touching fewer phones, fewer trade-ins of those phones.","In addition to that, as I mentioned, there were some higher IT expenses. I mean, we are investing in capabilities. We are becoming more agile. We're looking longer term with the business and trying to become more variable, have more variable expenses. So that was one part of it. There's also increased expenses from our legacy business or continued expenses, I guess I should say, from our legacy business, which was offset a little bit from some real estate JV income.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And sort of following up on the expense item there, it sounded like in the prepared remarks, there's sort of a focus in two parts. One, on improving the expense efficiencies and two, maybe some upfront costs in terms of improving the actual underlying technology. Can you give us a sense of your expectation for where you are in that process? Is this an event that's already begun? Should we expect elevated expenses in 2017 relative to 2016? And also a sense of where the geography of those may fall. It sounded like somewhere in Corporate relative to either Solutions or Property.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Michael, I think there's several questions in there. So, let me try to hit them and if I miss anything, please follow up with me. First of all, if I step back and look at churn overall, we're in the middle, as we've talked about, of a multi-year transformation to really reposition this company, addressing the lender-placed normalization and putting us very focused on growth markets and growth opportunities in Housing and Lifestyle. And if you look at 2016, I think a lot of forward progress on that.","We've largely completed the repositioning of the portfolio with benefits closed and most of those proceeds now up to the holding company, to help wind down more now complete than not. And the other critical thing we did this year was to realign our organization, which will create the opportunity to really take out effectiveness or improve effectiveness and improve our cost structure over time.","If you think about mobile specifically, one of the ways we've been gaining share and we've been gaining share now for multiple years, if you look at this business, it is dramatically bigger and stronger today than it was three years ago. The way we've gained that share is investing in capabilities. So, that's kind of ongoing. This quarter, we had a little bit more than we expected. We made some decisions to continue to invest in technology around things like automating some of our processes, trying to better align our cost structure with some of those variabilities in volumes. And so, again on 2017, we'll provide outlook for 2017 in February, as we always do with our fourth quarter earnings. But at a high level, that's how I think about what's going on.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, John, and welcome back.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, everybody. So, I think the commentary around the year-over-year impact from mobile, I think, is helpful, but I'm really more interested and I think most of the folks who I've spoken with since your pre-announcement, are more interested in what the driver is of the shortfall in 3Q results relative to your own expectations for the third quarter. And why your guide for the full year seems to anticipate that the pressure in the third quarter persists into the fourth quarter?","So, I guess, if there's anything you can do to sort of focus more on that because just last quarter or maybe a quarter before that, you had really had an outlook for pretty robust second half of the year and that changed pretty significantly. So, as opposed to the year-over-year, just more what's happened versus your expectation?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. Really a few things. But let me start with just a comment broadly. As we think about our business and build it over the long term, we do have some quarter-to-quarter variability just naturally with the size of our client programs and some of the businesses we operate in. But really three things were a little bit different than we had expected as we went into the back half of the year in the third quarter. We got good growth out of the new programs that we've announced over the last year or so, but a little bit less than we expected. And that was the shift that began to develop and play out in the third quarter.","The IT expenses, really choices we made. As we looked at our spending, we made some decisions to invest more in certain areas because we saw opportunities to deepen and expand capabilities, we think, positions us for the long term. That was a choice we made in the quarter. And then we were a little bit surprised that the whole industry was on the decline in trading activity in the third quarter. That could be just a function of people waiting for the new phones to come out, some of the noise in the market around some of the introductions that happened in August and September.","But fundamentally, if we take a long-term view on this business, if you think about \u2013 I'm going to talk about Solutions now, we put out in 2013 a goal that we can grow net operating income on average 10% per year in that business, not linear. And we reaffirmed that in 2015. Certainly, since 2013, we've more than achieved that goal. Obviously, in 2016, we're disappointed with what we are, but it doesn't change our longer-term outlook that we have had great momentum in this business. We continue to invest and we feel very well positioned for continued growth in Solutions and in mobile.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","But do you think, Alan, do you think, for example, the foregone trade-in activity in the quarter that, maybe, was part of the reason for the short fall, do you think that's just a delay and it's something we ought to think about getting back and sort of then some, or we do we think about that 10% average annual growth off of this new sort of a lower baseline of earnings?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, we put out that 10% originally in 2013; we reaffirmed it in 2015. So, I think as you think about the long term for this company out to 2020, think of it off of 2015.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","But you can't think of it as annual guidance. It's not...","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No, I understand.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. And as we add programs, that will cause step-function changes in our performance. But again, quarter-to-quarter, you get some variability.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then \u2013 just on the lender-placed side, a couple quick ones there. So the placement rate \u2013 I believe you said that the placement rate on the newly acquired $2 million loans this quarter is lower than your overall block. Is it enough so to alter your view of the steady state expected range of \u2013 I think it's 1.8% to 2.1%, or should we think of it as just, maybe, pushing you down a little bit further within that range?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","No. Hi, John. It's Richard. I think...","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, Richard.","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","As we said, it is a small block relative to the total blocks. Even though the penetration rate will be lower on this new piece, we still are looking at the longer term between 1.8% and 2.1%.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","And then, John, just on lender-placed, the normalization, as we've been saying, we expect to continue through 2017.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","And getting more towards the long-term run rate in 2018. The positive of adding these loans is it's just another market validation of how our clients view our compliance, our customer service, the quality of our operating model, but it doesn't change our view on the normalization. We've got another year or so to work through in 2017.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And sort of the follow-up question on lender-placed that I had was just to talk about premium rates. I mean, as we think out to 2017, I mean, you talked about a continued decline in revenue for LPI and some of that's obviously got to be a continued downward move on the placement rate, but is there still more to come on the actual premium rate; and if so, about how much would you expect looking out?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, as we think about it, and I've said this in prior quarters, we now think the rate filings are normal course. We've worked through that process with all of our states. We're on a regular basis, we re-file in many states annually. And I think it's just normal course based on experience, based on market factors in those states. Really, the bigger driver of the normalization is the reset of the placement rate gradually to the long-term average.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you, John, and welcome back.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. It's good to be back.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the call, the question. Just wanted to ask, I guess, first a question on Health and think about the excess capital position as I work through the math there. I know you had $475 million you expect to upstream of which, I believe, you've done about $340 million. So there is, call it, $135 million, $140 million left there. If we think about the $99 million of net reimbursements from CMS, if it's on your balance sheet, should that be additive to that $140 million that I just calculated?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","No, Seth, it should not. We anticipate that as we think about the capital, we're going to be able to take out of that business.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And had just one follow-up on Solutions and just trying to \u2013 I suppose parse your language here, and I understand the quarterly variability of the business. And I know we've seen that in quarters past, specifically the end of 2015 and then had some strong bounce back quarters in the first half of this year. Alan, in response to the last question, you talked about the three things that came in a little bit lower than expected which seem mostly to be aspects that looked more unique to the quarter. What I guess I'm a little bit confused about is that the updated guidance suggests a lower run rate for the fourth quarter than maybe the guidance prior to the \u2013 for the fourth quarter. So, it sounds like your expectations on a go-forward basis have been moved down as well, but I'm just curious if I'm reading that right or if I'm perhaps interpreting the guidance wrong here.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, the way to think about this is the things that happened in the third quarter, some of those persist into the fourth quarter, like the new programs still ramping, but they were behind where we thought they were going to be. And although they're improving, they're still behind where we thought they were going to be and we continued to make investments. It doesn't change our longer-term view, but as we've thought about this year, that's why we've revised the outlook for this year.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I had a few questions. First on just your expectations for buybacks in 2017 and 2016. It seems like in the past, you've slowed buybacks in the third quarter, this year that didn't happen. So, should we assume that you speeded up the buybacks because you've got the cash to the holding company faster or are you actually assuming that you could do more in buybacks than you might have thought maybe a few quarters ago?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, the way we've thought about this, and I'll start and then Richard you certainly should chime in. We want to be in the market consistently. Particularly, this year where we've had the capital position we've had. If you go back a few years when we didn't have as much excess capital at the holding company, we would slow buybacks in the third quarter. We saw no reason to do that. So, we have remained in the market consistently and as I said in my remarks, we're about a little more than halfway through now returning that $1.5 billion we committed during 2016-2017 to shareholders. Richard...?","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So that hasn't changed, the $1.5 billion?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","No, that has not changed.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then if I think about what you did in October, it seemed like the average price was around $89. So, a majority of the buybacks were done prior to your preannouncement. Why did you decide to do that? And why not just wait till you knew that it was going to be a bad quarter, just wait till after the announcement came out and then buy after?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. Hi Jimmy. It's Richard Dziadzio. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Really the reason is when we look at the stock price, we're actually looking more at the intrinsic value of the company, not the daily stock price. And also, when we are out in the market buying, we are using our 10b5-1. So, we're out in the market (33:19) at least in the last quarter consistently.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah, Jimmy, the important point there is we continue to believe our stock is attractively priced. And as Richard said, the way we buy back our stock generally is through 10b5-1 programs we file in advance and they run and we can't really amend those easily...","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","...because they're running.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, just lastly on the mortgage solutions business, that was actually a big positive this quarter. And obviously you've added acquisitions there that have helped. Just thinking about the run rate for growth in that business. Should we expect growth to slow down as the comps get tougher in some of these businesses that you've bought circle through a whole year or do you think the business can grow at a double-digit pace over the next year to two years?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, on mortgage solutions, what we're encouraged by is our thesis is playing out. Our thesis was that we had unique advantage to opportunities, leveraging our partnerships with mortgage companies. And that's played out well. And you've seen the very strong organic growth we've had so far. We see no reason why that can't continue.","Our market shares are still very modest. We're focused on really now translating that growth in the top line, which we think is going to continue to bottom line. And we've said we think we can get to 15% to 20% pre-tax margins long term over not only mortgage solutions, but all the capital-light fee income businesses in Property.","But no, we're encouraged by the growth in that business. Just as an aside, we just hired a leader to come in and integrate those businesses together. We've now acquired four different companies and really allow us to continue the momentum there.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just to clarify. Since you're buying using 10b5-1 plan, should we assume that there are any blackout periods or can you buy \u2013 do you intend to buy it throughout the quarter?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Well, no. Just to clarify, we put in the 10b5-1 when we're not in a blackout. And then...","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","...they just run.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Morning.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","To approach the mobile question from another vantage point, the new business that you brought online, did you have good visibility in terms of the historical behavior of these subscribers? Is there \u2013 could it just be that this subscriber base or these new clients just don't have as much activity \u2013 underlying activity as you might have expected and so therefore, you should adjust your expectations accordingly, or do you have good information on the historical behavior and so you can confidently say this is just normal variability?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","The answer is some of everything you said. So, some of the new programs are truly new to the market. So we work with a partner to try to estimate what we think the penetration rates will be, the take-up rates. But when they're new to the market, everybody's trying to make their best estimate. Some of them are new programs with existing customers, that's easier for us and them to predict, but that's part of a \u2013 if you looked at the last year, year and a half, we've announced several new programs with new customers. Those are the ones where it's hardest for them and for us to predict what's going to happen.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And in those cases, seeing the volume that you do, are you able to adjust your expense structure if in fact the take-rate is lower than you might have originally forecasted?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Something we're working on. I mentioned briefly earlier that as we think about the business, for example, like repair and logistics which can have big swings in volume up and down in a quarter, we are working to better align our cost structure with that. A lot of the automation we've been doing and investing in is to create a better alignment there.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Any thoughts on how those programs have been performing here early in the fourth quarter?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","No, it's too early for us to provide any outlook on the fourth quarter other than what we said for the full year of 2016.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then in the capital-light Property business's margin there, you talked about making investments to put pressure on the margin. Is that something that is short-term in nature or is this kind of structurally you're at 9% or 10% and it'll move up over time or is there a step function out there somewhere in the near term to medium term that that should bounce back more meaningfully?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, Mark, the way I think about this, we're early in those businesses. We've now been in them for two years to three years. If you compare to a quarter a year ago, we were at about 15%, I think is what we had at that quarter, maybe a little more. And so as we build this business out, we're getting some fluctuation, but it doesn't change our long-term view of 15% to 20% pre-tax margin.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Gary.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning. I had a question on flood insurance. I know you have a lender-placed business. You have the NFIP administration.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yes.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","But you also have a small start-up voluntary flood business. And I just wondered if you could go over how that fits in and what your overall strategy for flood generally is over the next few years.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, first of all, that voluntary flood business is very small. We think of it as the pilot. And really, what we're trying to do there is thinking about a couple things. So, we have a very strong position in flood, right? We're the number two administrator in the NFIP program. For our clients and mortgage, we do a lot of lender-placed flood. And we've been experimenting with gaps in the coverage of the NFIP program, a potential evolution of the NFIP program. So, think of it as just a pilot for us to learn more about how the flood market might evolve, how consumers might react. We view flood though as an important business for us and we just want to make sure we remain one of the market leaders as it evolves. But it's very small, that voluntary flood business right now.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Do you use the data that you collect from all the NFIP business? Does that help you or inform you on how to underwrite the flood business as you go forward on the voluntary side?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","We have lots of information from various sources, from our lender-placed business, from the flood maps that are out there. We work with multiple third-party providers on flood and flood risk. All of that goes into our thinking. And then we have a history, a long history of our own data to use.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. And just one other question on the mobile side. Did all the Samsung issues, did that have some direct or indirect impact on what you saw in the quarter?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Hi, Mark \u2013 Hi, Gary. It's Richard Dziadzio. Not really. Not really. I mean, it's a new program under warranty. So, no. It was a recall. So, no impact on...","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Right.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. Under manufacturer warranty, just to be clear, right? So, that's why the risk there was of the partner, not us.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Well, that's why I was thinking maybe indirect because they're not coming anywhere other than the manufacturer, but that's fine if you don't think it had an impact.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","No. No material impact.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Thank you very much then.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","All right.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for your questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Executive Vice President and Chief Communications, Marketing Officer. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi","Thanks Christina, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2019. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Alan and Richard before moving on to Q&A.","Some of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.","During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement.","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our operating results for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2019 as they illustrate our ongoing ability to deliver superior value for our customers, employees and shareholders. For the full year net operating income excluding reportable catastrophes increased 11% or earnings per share grew 6% reflecting the shares issued for The Warranty Group acquisition. After adjusting for certain nonrecurring items, Richard which will detail later, net operating income increased 15% and earnings per share grew 10% at the high-end of our expectations.","These results primarily reflected the stronger than expected performance of our mobile business and full year contributions from The Warranty Group. Overall, we continue to evolve our mix of business with about three quarters of our segment earnings now coming from non-catastrophe exposed businesses driven by strong growth in Connected Living. We believe this allows us to generate more diversified earnings and cash flow.","In 2019 our operating segments contributed a total of $748 million in dividends to the holding company. This allowed us to raise our common stock dividend for the 15th consecutive year since our IPO and returned $426 million to our shareholders. This positions us to deliver on our Investor Day objective to return a total of $1.35 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021.","We delivered strong earnings and cash flows, while also taking actions to strengthen Assurant for the future. We added or renewed more than 60 valuable client partnerships across our Lifestyle and Housing segments and launched several new product offerings to drive even greater value for our customers. Our targeted investments in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, and other capabilities, will ensure that we continue to deliver superior experience for the 300 million consumers we serve worldwide.","These investments also were made possible by the $100 million in gross expense saves we've now realized since 2016. Our performance wouldn't be possible without the unwavering dedication of our 14,000 employees across the world. They continue to serve not only our customers but their local communities as well.","With our Assurant Foundation during 2019, we provided support to nearly 1300 charities focused on helping our local communities grow stronger. Most recently this included relief for the Australian wildfires and the earthquakes in Puerto Rico. In March we will publish our next Assurant Social Responsibility Report to share our progress on multiple environmental, social and governance priorities, which we believe are key to the execution of our strategy.","Now let me provide additional highlights from the year for each of our business segments. Within Global Lifestyle 2019 was a record year as we increased earnings 37% to $409 million. Connected Living was the major contributor as this segment benefited from several long-standing partnerships and the market success of 10 new mobile programs added since 2017.","As of year-end we now protect over 53 million mobile subscribers, an increase of 15% year-over-year. importantly, we cemented several key partnerships, including securing a long-term extension of a major client relationship in Japan with increased number of covered devices by over 50% just in the last year.","Key to our success has been our ability to drive additional value for customers by expanding our fee-for-service offerings beyond traditional vice protection, to include value-added offerings like personal tech pro and Pocket Geek. These platforms allow customers to help solve technical issues, optimize performance of their devices and connect to live technical assistance, all of which delivers a better experience as tracked through our net promoter scores.","In the year ahead we will look to further expand our services to include new offerings such as ID protection. In Global Automotive we protect over 47 million vehicles worldwide, up by almost 3 million since 2018. This growth is the result of the strength of our relationships with global OEMs, national dealers, and TPAs and the scale and expertise we acquired with The Warranty Group.","In 2019 TWG contributed an estimated $130 million to Global Lifestyle's earnings after accounting for intangibles and synergies. As we announced in the second quarter, we've delivered operating synergies beyond our initial goal of $60 million pretax since the close of the acquisition. While 2020 earnings growth is expected to moderate from a record 2019, it supports our view that we can grow net operating income by at least 10% on average from 2019 through 2021 and continue to produce strong cash flows in Global Lifestyle.","Moving to Global Housing, we generated operating return to equity including Cats of almost 17%, which we believe continues to surpass the P&C industry average. We benefited from a relatively mild Cat year and continued growth within our multifamily housing business. While we incurred higher losses within our specially housing portfolio, we have taken actions to limit our go forward exposure and improve results this year.","Within our Lender-placed business revenue we renewed 16 clients representing approximately 60% of our tracked loans, a testament to our superior offerings. As we look to sustain our leadership position, we will continue to invest in our more efficient and customer centric single source platform where we have now on-boarded multiple clients and have plans to onboard others in the pipeline.","In Multifamily Housing, we grew our rental policies to $2.2 million, up 10%, while also growing revenue by 6%. Our focus remains on driving a superior experience for both our clients and renters. We continued the rollout of our integrated billing and tracking platform, which provides substantial value to renters and landlords to allow us to increase attachment rates going forward.","Overall, we believe the actions we've taken within Global Housing positions the business for profitable growth in 2020 and enables us to further generate above average returns and strong cash flows.","In Global Preneed we delivered $52 million in net operating income after the one-time tax adjustment in the third quarter. During the course of the year, we continued to leverage our strong long-term partnership with SCI, an industry leader, while also growing our final need business with new distribution partners. This has allowed us to create a more profitable sales mix as we continue to generate strong cash flows.","The unique characteristics of this business, including low mortality risk relative to other life insurance products, steadily growing earnings and strong cash flows, provides us with confidence that we can sustain operating ROE of 13% in Global Preneed long-term.","To summarize, 2019 was a strong year for Assurant. We deepened our relationships with many leading brands, delivered superior value for end consumers, and strengthened our bench of talent. All of this helped us generate a more diversified base of earnings from which we expect to continue to grow.","For full year 2020, we expect operating earnings per diluted share excluding catastrophe losses to increase by 10 to 14% from $9.21 in 2019. The range includes a 1% negative impact related to convertible shares being dilutive for 2020. EPS growth will be driven primarily by higher net operating income across each of our segments, as well as continued share repurchases. We believe our 2020 builds off a larger and more diversified mix of businesses.","Overall, it gives us confidence that we can meet our financial objective of 12% annual EPS growth on average for 2020 and 2021. As we enter the Connected decade, we believe it will create opportunities for Assurant as consumer lifestyles will increasingly intertwine with our Connected ecosystems.","For example, with the rollout of 5G and major enhancements to vehicle technology on the horizon, we look to address consumer needs in both the Connected Home and Connected Car. We believe that investing in our people, customer experience, and innovation should allow us to continue to expand earnings and cash flow over the long-term. To prepare [ph] we will drive investments, both organic and through targeted acquisitions to scale our operations, develop new offerings and launch new client programs, while strengthening our infrastructure to support future growth.","I will now turn the call over to Richard to review fourth quarter results and 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you, and good morning everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our overall performance for 2019. I'm now going to review our fourth quarter results and our 2020 outlook in more detail.","Excluding Cats fourth quarter 2019 net operating income declined by $5 million to $140 million due to the absence of a client recoverable in the prior year period. In the quarter, we accelerated investments within Global Lifestyle to support future growth driven by strong business momentum. At the same time, we also took actions to transform our IT operations, which resulted in $8 million of severance. Savings are expected to fund future investments in our infrastructure and cloud capabilities.","Now let's move to segment results for Global Lifestyle. This segment posted earnings of $97 million, an increase of 15% when excluding $4 million of IT severance and a $9 million client recoverable from the prior year period. Growth was driven primarily by continued mobile subscriber growth from programs in Asia-Pacific and North America. This was partially offset by investments to support business growth.","In Global Automotive earnings declined due to higher expenses to support business growth, partially offset by growth in the national dealer and TPA distribution channels. Total revenue for this segment was up $233 million or 14%. The increase was driven by expansion within Connected Living primarily from mobile carriers and OEMs and to a lesser extent extended service contracts.","Within Global Automotive, revenue grew 11%, primarily reflecting prior period sales of VSCs across all three distribution channels while our protected vehicle count increased by 7%. For the full year 2020, we expect Global Lifestye's net operating income to be up modestly compared to an exceptionally strong 2019. This is in line with expectations we presented at Investor Day.","The main driver will be growth from maturing Connected Living programs launched since 2017. As always, trading activity will be driven by the timing and success of new phone introductions and carrier promotions which can vary from quarter to quarter.","Throughout the year we expect to make additional investments to support new programs and future growth. Our Global Automotive business is also expected to grow next year, but to a lesser degree than Connected Living. Growth will be driven by prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Auto results will continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment and expected declines in investment income.","Within Global Financial Services, we continue to anticipate declines in our legacy Credit Insurance business, which will offset growth from embedded card benefit offerings as we scale our programs in the United States.","Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $73 million, an increase of $85 million year-over-year, largely driven by lower reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses and $3 million of IT severance, earnings declined $8 million. This was driven by higher loss experience primarily related to a client within our sharing economy portfolio. In response, we've taken actions to improve results, including terminating certain coverages and we are continuing to monitor experience closely.","Lender-placed income contracted, reflecting the reduction in policies enforced from the financially insolvent client we previously disclosed. Higher premium rates and lower expenses helped to partially offset the decline.","Within Small Commercial, policies are now in runoff and results improved during the quarter in line with our expectations. Going forward, we expect contributions from the business to be immaterial.","Turning to revenue, Global Housing net earned premiums and fees increased 2% driven by our Specialty Property and Multifamily Housing businesses. Lender-placed revenues decreased, reflecting the reduction in loans referenced earlier, partially offset by higher premium rates. The placement rate within the Lender-placed business decreased to 1.58% down 5 basis points year-over-year and 3 basis points sequentially, reflecting our mix of loans.","In January, we placed two-thirds of our 2020 Catastrophe Reinsurance program and expect to finalize the program in July. We secured additional multiyear coverage with now 47% of our U.S. program benefiting from this feature. We maintained our per event retention levels at $80 million. As we believe the actions we took last year, combined with growth in our non-Cat exposed businesses provide appropriate risk return balance for 2020. As always, we will continue to reevaluate our exposure.","For 2020 we expect Global Housing net operating income excluding Cats to increase for the first time after several years of decline, driven by expansion across all of our lines of business. Results should benefit from improved profitability in our Specially Property offerings including the wind down of our small commercial business.","Lender-placed growth will be partially offset by the transition of loans from the financial insolvent client over the next few quarters. Lastly, we expect continued growth in Multifamily, reflecting increased penetration across our PMC and affinity partner channels.","While still early, we're monitoring claims from the earthquakes in Puerto Rico in January and believe that they will surpass our reportable catastrophe threshold of $5 million pretax. Overall, we continue to believe that we can generate above market operating returns on equity of 17% to 20% including Caps through 2021. Should the economy soften, this segment has potential for additional upside.","Now let's move to Global Preneed. This segment reported $16 million of net operating income, down slightly year-over-year due to a combination of lower real estate income and lower investment yields. Revenue for preneed was up 6% driven by U.S. growth, including final need sales as we continue to add new distribution partners.","In 2020 we expect Global Preneed's earnings to be up compared to 2019 reported results and relatively flat, excluding the third quarter DAC adjustment. Growth from existing distribution partners and adjacent offerings will be offset by lower portfolio yields due to the current interest rate environment.","At corporate, the net operating loss was $22 million, a $6 million improvement compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to the benefit from our annual consolidating tax rate adjustment and lower employee related expenses.","For the full year 2020, we expect the corporate loss to be similar to 2019, around $85 million as we continue to benefit from scale efficiencies. Interest expense should be approximately $81 million. Amount of savings from 2019, driven by our debt financing last year. Preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $19 million.","Turning to holding company liquidity, we ended the year with $534 million or $309 million above our current minimum target level of $225 million. Dividends in the quarter from operating segments totaled $276 million. In terms of inflows, we received $27 million in upfront cash related to the sale of rights to future claims from our ACA risk corridor program receivables.","In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, key outflows included $109 million in share repurchases and $43 million in common and preferred dividends. In 2020 we will continue to be strong stewards of our capital. For the full year we expect segment dividends to approximate segment earnings, providing us the flexibility to invest in our businesses through organic growth and acquisitions, as well as return of capital to shareholders in line with our stated objectives subject to market conditions.","We expect the pace and level of buyback to be somewhat similar to 2019 and weighted toward the second half of the year. In January, we signed an agreement to sell our interests in EK to certain management shareholders. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect the closing to occur in the second quarter. This will result in an expected net cash outflow of approximately $54 million. This amount represents the difference between the balance owed on the put call and the agreed sale price.","The amount could increase up to an additional $40 million in the event we provide seller financing at closing. As a result of the pending sale, we are required to further adjust the fair value at end year, which resulted in an additional charge to net income of $33 million. We believe divesting in EK will enable us to deploy our capital and management attention to our targeted areas where we can drive greater shareholder value.","In summary, we're pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019, which provide a solid foundation to drive continued growth into 2020.","And with that operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey, Good morning, Mark.","Mark Hughes","Thank you, good morning. The investments in the Global Lifestyle business that was one of the interesting things in the quarter was the step-up in expenses, I wonder if you could just give a little detail about timing of expenses, the magnitude of that investment compared to the prior periods you're talking about NOI and the lifestyle being up modestly, you've clearly stepped up the investment in 2019 and does that continue into 2020 and just a little more detail there would be helpful?","Alan Colberg","Yes, no, Mark. First is the question, you know a couple of thoughts on how to think about expenses in Global Lifestyle. First, it is important to remember that we have an ongoing mix shift occurring in that business, whereas we increasingly drive services and fee income. You are going to see SG&A growing and you're going to see the traditional underwriting or premium not growing. And so part of what you're seeing there is just about mix shift and that's going to continue.","We are going to continue to add the additional services. Most of what went on in 2019 was really to absorb the growth which was extraordinary in Lifestyle 2019 and this set up for continued growth in 2020. You also have the one-time IT severance event in Q4 which was also about setting up and helping fund the transition we need to continue to make to cloud, to digital, to even strengthening further our customer experience. But we feel good about lifestyle's 2019 results and very well positioned for continued growth in 2020.","Mark Hughes","The sharing economy losses within Global Housing, you described that as having an influence on the overall loss ratio. Could you expand on that a little bit more? And you I think described here as the one client, any more detail would be helpful?","Alan Colberg","Yes, so let me provide some context on how we think about this sharing economy. So as we look to the future and the shift in ownership models from owning to renting, we see a strong alignment between what we're doing in the Connected Car or what we see happening around rental and the sharing economy, and we've been investing in a variety of experiments over the last couple years to understand how might these covers evolve, how might our services evolve.","One of them didn\u2019t perform the way we expected this year in 2019, so we took aggressive action at the end of the year to improve the results and we expect those results to improve significantly as we head into next year. But again the sharing economy, very strategic for us and something we're going to continue to invest in as we go forward.","Mark Hughes","Is that to say, maybe a little bit of a catch-up on losses in that segment in the fourth quarter?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, that\u2019s \u2013 it's Richard, hi Mark. Yes, that's right. We had some increase in claims come in, in Q4 and then put up some IBNR related to that.","Mark Hughes","And then one final question, you have mentioned on Global Auto the lower interest rate is having an impact on that business, any way to quantify that for us?","Richard Dziadzio","I would sort of say if you look at the lifestyle, the balance sheet and the lifestyle business, there is a level of invested assets in that. A lot of that is related to auto. Think about auto having some level of duration that's linked to the premiums we underwrite and the time of business we put in. So there will be a rollover in that business. So as interest rates have come down and the business rolls through, there will be an impact. On the other hand the business is growing. And so that will offset that and that's why we say as we go forward that the overall auto business will increase its profitability.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Alan Colberg","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hi, good morning Brian.","Richard Dziadzio","Good morning Brian.","Brian Meredith","Good morning. A couple ones here for you. Just first, I appreciate your walk through the new catastrophe reinsurance program, but with your - any additional costs that we should expect from that program in 2020, maybe depressing margins a little bit in the Global Housing area?","Richard Dziadzio","Well, I mean, I guess first I would say that as you heard in the prepared remarks, overall housing is going to be growing next year, really turning that corner. So we think that's a great thing and a great moment for the segment.","In terms of the catastrophe reinsurance, we renewed a big portion of it at year-end. We did have some uptick in the rates, it wasn't huge. That's been built into the planning and the 10% to 14% EPS growth that Alan mentioned earlier. On the other hand, some of our exposures will come down. So that will offset the aggregate or absolute level of the reinsurance premium.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then another one a little broader. So yesterday, there was an announcement that the Sprint, T-Mobile merger looks like it's going to happen here. I'm wondering anything you can kind of provide on the kind of opportunity there and timing, how long does it typically take for these things to kind of work them to play out once the merger is completed, and they decided what carrier they're going to use?","Alan Colberg","Yes, you know, first I want to congratulate our partner on what could be a potentially transformative merger for them and for the U.S. wireless industry. And I think we're in a good position with T-Mobile. Over the last seven, eight years, we've become their partner of choice for everything they're doing broadly in the mobile ecosystem and that sets us up well to continue to grow with them. So too early to speculate on what might happen, and to be clear, we said this on Investor Day, we haven't factored anything related to new clients into our outlook.","Brian Meredith","I am just curious Alan, is there any anything you can kind of tell us and how long does it typically take post, let's say a merger close or does it happen coincident with the merger close that decisions are made with respect to who gets the business?","Alan Colberg","Yes, hard to speculate on this. We're an unprecedented situation with the merger of major carriers. I would just come back to our position to support T-Mobile's growth into the future.","Brian Meredith","Great. That's all we have for you right now. Thanks.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hi, good morning Mike.","Richard Dziadzio","Good morning Mike.","Michael Phillips","Good morning guys. Good morning, thanks. I guess first off on the guidance, I want to talk about that a little bit, the 10% to 14%, starting with the 921 from this year, I guess if you adjust the 921 for items this year, there's obviously some moving parts, but you can bring that up maybe from the severance to the DAC, and you can bring it up to maybe 950. And so, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this right, if we do that at 10% to 14% it kind of looks more like a 6.5 to 10, which sounds a lot like the last year's and guidance. But I guess hey, does that sound right? And I think like that, right. And then if I am - is it simply because of your guidance talks on the Lifestyle being more modest this year versus last year or what would cause the guidance to be if I adjust that correctly, if the guidance be about the same as last year? Thanks.","Alan Colberg","Yes, absolutely. So a few thoughts on that. First, our outlook for 2020 is very much in line with what we had shared at Investor Day back in the spring of 2019. Second, we are continuing to invest and it's important to invest on the back of an extraordinary growth year and Connected Living last year, so you will see us continue to invest in the migration of our infrastructure to the cloud, which improves our delivery and reliability and capabilities.","You'll see us continuing to invest in the next product. I mentioned briefly ID protection, but we have a whole pipeline of things that we're going to embed into our offerings in the years ahead that also creates additional future profit, but it's an investment today.","The other thing I would say, we're growing off of a much larger base in 2020. 2019 had the benefit of a full-year of really capturing The Warranty Group synergies and driving that into our business. That's good news, but creates a much larger starting point as we head into 2020.","The final couple of things I'd say on it is it's early in the year. We are being appropriately measured in how we think about the outlook. When we set an expectation, we fully intend to meet that expectation. And we have a strong pipeline that if that develops this year, as we've talked about in the past, if we launched another new program, another client, that will actually hurt in the short-term in earnings, but is a very positive long-term development for our shareholders.","Michael Phillips","Okay, great. Thank you very much for that. I guess a quick one on the EK, I don\u2019t know, if I'm saying that wrong, EK investment, and I guess what are your expectations that for maybe some capital releases the $54 million [ph] cash outlay the second quarter, but any capital releases that may come from that and expectations on how that may be employed this year?","Alan Colberg","So I'll ask Richard to answer that in just a minute. But I think it's important just to remind everyone the context of why we made the decision to exit EK. That investment was originally put in place seven years ago in a very different Assurant. And it was put in place with the objective to really grow scale in Latin America, as well as potentially expand some fee income opportunities.","With The Warranty Group deal, we are in a much stronger position in Latin America and international, and it just became not nearly strategically relevant, and we are trying to focus our efforts around our true growth businesses, and so that led the decision. And then Richard, do you want to answer that question? ","Richard Dziadzio","Right, Just in terms of the overall cash that would free up our liquidity, think about \u2013 I mean obviously, we have a cash outflow with the [indiscernible] that could put call and the price we're selling it for. The overall cash out, that would be freed up would be about $100 million, think $100 million. Think about it in that net level.","And again, as we talked about at Investor Day that would go to potentially fund incremental organic growth as Alan just talked about, the momentum we have behind us, it would go to M&A, and it would go to capital repurchases. So really keeping that discipline that we've had all along and thinking about, where's the best way to employ that new capital.","Michael Phillips","Okay, perfect, thank you. That's very helpful. And then just lastly, a little bit on Global Housing. You've talked a lot about kind of expense savings and efficiencies there and I wonder if you could elaborate more on what we can expect going forward from here for this year.","Alan Colberg","Yes, so I'll start and then Richard feel free to add on to it. First of all, we were disappointed in the 2019 results of housing. But I think we took actions collectively that put housing into a much better position as we head into 2020.","If you look at Lender-placed homeowners, extraordinary progress last year, kind of in consolidating our franchise, beginning to make real progress and converting clients to our Single Source Processing System, which will continue. That affects our expenses every time we convert one, we can then reduce some expenses related to that. So that business is well positioned and then with the reductions we've taken in the retention on the Cat exposure, we feel good about that business.","Multifamily, although the growth was a little bit slower, it's still above market. We continue to gain share, and we have consolidated our position there by investing in digital and being able to provide a new way to acquire that product. And then finally in Specialty, obviously the real disappointments last year, but at the end of the day, we're running experiments, if they work great, and then we scale them. If they don't we take decisive action and as you heard Richard say, we did that on Small Commercial and it's now going to be kind of immaterial in 2020.","Richard Dziadzio","I would just add, just overall, we have a great expense discipline in the company and culture in the company. So we are looking at across the board to make sure we're leveraging the power of the size that we have, so that's one thing. I guess in terms of the ratio itself, expense ratio, as we've cut down a couple of these businesses that haven't been positive for us, you might see a little pressure on that, but not much at all. And then the last thing I'd say is, if you look at our combined ratio and housing for the year about 89%, including Cats, it's a very good ratio all in, and it's well within what we've talked about at Investor Day.","Michael Phillips","Okay, thank you. And this last one, sorry, I might have missed this, but I'm still a little confused on the Lifestyle side kind of increases. Therefore expenses this year versus last year in terms of the investment, I know you talked about earlier in one of the questions, but again, I may have missed it, but can you kind of maybe turn on a little bit more on what we can expect for kind of a run rate going forward for the Lifestyle expenses this year?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So to clarify, maybe what I said earlier, so probably the biggest thing going on in Lifestyle is this evolving business mix, where as we grow, what's growing disproportionately our fee income and services, those are primarily expense driven. And so you're going to see that effect continuing of SG&A growing faster than you might expect. But it's because we're creating new fee income streams that are diversifying our earnings that don't have exposure or volatility really in those earnings. I think that's a big positive.","If you look at investments, hard to say exactly how investments this year will compare to last year, a lot will depend on whether we're able to sign some new clients. Because a big part of our investment is when we sign a new client, we have to ramp up the people, the technology, the marketing, the filings, et cetera. But we're going to continue to invest. This is a business that has a history now for many years of strong double-digit growth on average. And we see that continuing into the future, so we're going to continue to invest in lifestyle.","Michael Phillips","Okay, perfect. Thanks very much.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Gary Ransom","Good morning guys.","Alan Colberg","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Ransom","Good morning. I had a question on Global Healthcare recovery, was the amount you received the actual reduction in the valuation allowance and is there anything \u2013 is there any additional potential on that?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, so for those who weren't following the company five years ago, this relates to the 2015 risk corridor when we were winding down the Health Insurance business. We were owed a little bit over $100 million by the U.S. Government. We did not think it was collectible. So we fully wrote it off back in 2015. So we had zero carrying value. We received $27 million pretax inflow as part of selling our right to that recoverable. We also have a gain share if there is recovery above the $27 million, but given the uncertainty that still exists to whether there will ever be a payment on that, we have not put anything on the books for that gained share.","Gary Ransom","So it sounds like the $27 million is sort of a close to the final part of the story?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, unless there's some extraordinary payout on that eventually, but yes for now, that's what we realistically expect to get from that receivable.","Gary Ransom","Okay. I also had a question on Preneed, you didn't really say a lot about the guidance for that business. Is there anything to add about what you expect on the operating earnings in that segment?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, I think the important thing to remember on Preneed is it's a strong, pretty predictable business that is delivering on average 13% ROE, which we believe is, better than typical for that industry. We have a long-term partnership with the industry leader, and we expect slow - we're not trying to grow that business in a meaningful way. It's just a slow, steady growth just growing with the industry contributing cash flow that we're using to invest elsewhere in the company.","Gary Ransom","Does owning that business give you any advantages or diversification benefits with the rating agencies?","Alan Colberg","Well yes, I mean it is part of the diversity that we get overall. I mean, I put it into perspective, though, I mean, given the size of it and the relative size of Assurant, I would say that's, fairly, fairly small. And I mean, some of the headwinds we have in investment rates, interest rates too are kind of our - are part of what allows us to say that, earnings will be fairly modest next year, will be up relative to what we posted this year on DAC, but then, fairly flat next year.","Gary Ransom","Okay. Thank you. And I guess I wanted to also follow up on the reconciling in my own mind, the guidance you gave at Investor Day, with 2020 kind of being a dip in this path, this 12% EPS growth and then, more or less recovering in 2021. Is everything you're talking about today consistent with that from your point of view, are there any nuances that you'd like to add on that?","Alan Colberg","No, I would say it's very consistent with what we saw as we were preparing for Investor Day last year. I would say I think the business is stronger today with more momentum and a diversified larger base of earnings, but largely consistent with what we had expected for 2020 and looking out into the future.","Gary Ransom","Did you actually pull for, I think I heard during your original remarks, maybe Richard, that you had pulled forward some of the expenses in this severance charge, did you clarify on that?","Richard Dziadzio","Well, essentially what we're saying is at the end of 2019 we had severance charges. So severance charges would be that reduction in staff going into this year, that reduction in staff would decrease the expenses. We're not expecting that to fall to the bottom line. What we're expecting to do is redeploy that in the IT infrastructure, the cloud capabilities that we mentioned, et cetera.","Gary Ransom","Are there additional severance charges that might be coming as we go into 2020?","Richard Dziadzio","Nothing that wouldn't be outside the BAU type of stuff, that was exceptional for us.","Gary Ransom","Okay. Yes and just one more thing on the sharing economy loss, it sounds like there were, by saying you're correcting it and getting the underwriting or pricing right, that there's some sort of loss characteristic of this business that's a feature of the business, so to speak. I mean, can you help clarify, is there something about sharing economy risk that is notably different than what you thought?","Alan Colberg","No, this was really an issue with one client where we ran into some unexpected problems and how their business performed with us. But overall, I think we continue to be encouraged by the progress there and ultimately see some of the products and capabilities that are being integrated into our offerings around the auto, for example.","Gary Ransom","Okay, I guess that's all I have. Thank you very much.","Richard Dziadzio","Thanks, Gary.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey, Mark.","Mark Hughes","Hey, just a quick question on the Lender-placed business, when we think about rates in 2020 versus 2019, how is your pricing year-on-year? Presumably there's some underlying inflation on materials, et cetera. So what would one anticipate other things being equal going to aggregate the price increase or if it is not?","Alan Colberg","Yes, let me let me start on that. I mean, the good news on Lender-placed is that business is in a really strong position today. We've addressed all of the regulatory issues now many years in the past. Our rates are ordinary of course, they reflect our experience, and on balance rates are going up.","Mark Hughes","Any way to characterize that low single or mid single?","Richard Dziadzio","I guess the way that we look at it, as we look at the rates, but we also look at the placement rate. So overall it was the impact on the profitability of the business and we've seen that the rates, I mean obviously, they vary by state to state. But as Alan said, overall, they're up and they offset or partially offset, kind of the placement rate the decrease in the placement rate that we have, so it is kind of balancing it to a certain extent.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Richard Dziadzio","Okay. Thanks Mark.","Alan Colberg","All right, well I want to thank everyone for participating in today's call. We're very pleased with our performance in 2019 and we're looking forward to another strong year in 2020. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our first quarter earnings call in May. In the meantime, please reach out to Sean Moshier with any follow up questions. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following management's prepared remarks.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Executive Vice President, Chief Communication and Marketing Officer. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi - EVP, Chief Communication and Marketing Officer","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. As noted in the release, beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to focus on housing and lifestyle. Net operating income will now reflect contributions from our ongoing business segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property, and Corporate, as well as interest expense. Operating results will exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the divested Employee Benefits business and the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions. Related prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation.","We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy. As we continue to work through our transformation, we expect to make additional enhancements to our reporting format. Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurant.com.","We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris, before moving to Q&A.","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and upcoming first quarter Form 10-Q.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Alan","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Overall we are pleased with the strong first quarter performance of our housing and lifestyle businesses. Our results reaffirm our confidence in the future and progress against the financial targets we shared at our Investor Day, as we strengthen our company for long-term profitable growth.","During the first quarter, we continued to execute our multi-year transformation strategy. For example, the sale of Employee Benefits to Sun Life Financial closed on March 1. We expect the dividend cash proceeds to the holding company starting this quarter, subject to regulatory approval. The wind down of our Health operations also remains on track. Membership continued to decline to only 26,000 covered lives as of March 31, down 93% since year-end.","In addition, claims development from 2015 policies continue to be in line with our assumptions. During the first quarter, we began work on the go-forward operating structure under Gene Mergelmeyer, as he prepares to move into the Chief Operating Officer role in July. Our goal is to leverage our enterprise scale and strengthen our competitive advantage across the global housing and lifestyle markets we serve.","In support of our transformation and growth strategy, last week we announced Ajay Waghray will join Assurant on May 9 as our new Chief Technology Officer. Ajay joins our leadership team from Verizon with decades of global management and IT experience. At Assurant, Ajay will drive business alignment and strategy for technology across the global enterprise and support our broader commitments outlined at Investor Day. We also expect to have the new CFO on board in the coming months. Until a successor is appointed, we appreciate that Chris will continue to perform these duties while preparing for his new role as Chief Risk Officer.","Within our segments, there are also many initiatives underway to strengthen our competitive position and expand our integrated risk offerings. At Assurant Solutions, we remain focused on executing our strategy of growing the Connected Living platform globally through innovative products and services as well as new partnerships. Longer-term, we expect to double margins in Connected Living to 8% by scaling our offerings, driving operating efficiencies and managing declines in our legacy runoff businesses. These efforts, along with steady contributions from Vehicle Protection and Preneed will position Solutions to deliver 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term.","At Assurant Specialty Property, we are expanding our fee-based, capital-light businesses. These offerings now account for 27% of the segments revenue and are expected to continue to grow double-digits in the long term. At the same time, we are actively managing the ongoing normalization of lender-placed with our expense management initiatives. These efforts will help Specialty Property to maintain at least a 20% operating ROE longer-term.","Executing our strategy will require us to invest prudently in our targeted growth areas to further diversify and strengthen our housing and lifestyle businesses. For example, we acquired a company that provides insurance coverage for parcel deliveries via major shipping carriers. We plan to integrate their e-commerce capabilities into our other Assurant offerings to provide a seamless customer buying experience.","Last week, we also announced the purchase of renewal rights on 250,000 flood policies from Nationwide. This solidifies our position as the second largest administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States.","Overall, we're making good progress in diversifying our offerings and establishing a more integrated operational structure. We believe this will help us build a stronger Assurant for the future.","At our March Investor Day, we introduced three key long-term financial targets to track our progress. During the next five years, we expect to do the following; deliver growth in net operating income, increase operating earnings per share on average by at least 15% annually, and expand operating ROE to 15% by 2020. These targets all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent variability of weather.","Now, I'll highlight our performance in the first quarter 2016 in relation to these long-term financial targets. Net operating income excluding reportable catastrophe losses declined 8% to $110 million. While we expect earnings to be down for full year 2016 driven by the normalization (8:11) of lender-placed, we are preparing the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond. Operating earnings per share excluding catastrophe losses decreased 2% from first quarter 2015 to $1.66. The decline in earnings was partially offset by share buyback activity.","Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI and catastrophe losses, was 12.3% up from 12% at year-end, reflecting a shift to more fee-based and capital-light businesses. Looking at our capital position, our balance sheet remains strong. At the end of March, holding company capital totaled $450 million. Consistent with our intent to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2017, through April 22 we returned a total of $355 million via dividends and share repurchases or nearly 25% of that goal.","Overall, we're pleased with our progress during the first quarter. We believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable diversified earnings, stronger cash flow generation and continued capital management flexibility. And now I'll turn to Chris, who will review the results for the first quarter in additional detail. Chris?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thanks, Alan. At Solutions, we were pleased with the improvement in underlying results from the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared to first quarter of 2015 however, net operating income declined $7 million to $47 million primarily due to the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program and declines within our legacy runoff business.","We also incurred some additional onboarding costs related to new mobile programs expected to ramp up later in the year. Preneed recorded a one-time $4 million net reserve and DAC adjustment associated with a block of older policies that also contributed to lower results. Revenue at Solutions increased 5% from the prior period in 2015, driven by a higher volume of covered mobile devices globally and strong growth in Vehicle protection. This was partially offset by declines at certain North American retailers, and the impact from foreign exchange.","For the full year, we continue to expect growth in net operating income, weighted towards the second half of 2016. New mobile programs, improved international profitability and expense initiatives within Solutions will drive the increase.","Now, let's look at Specialty Property, which delivered a strong quarter despite ongoing normalization in lender-placed. Net operating income increased to $76 million, reflecting lower general expenses, more favorable loss experience and lower reinsurance costs as our risk exposure continued to decline.","Results also include greater contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. The combined ratio for lender-placed and manufactured housing risk products was 80.7%, 140 basis points better than last year. This improvement was the result of a decline in the frequency and severity of non-catastrophe claims and lower general expenses.","Despite lower premiums, we expect our expense ratio for these risk-based products to move toward the long-term targeted range of 42% to 44% by 2018, though the trajectory won't be linear. Specialty Property revenue decreased 6%. The previously disclosed loss of client business, along with placement rate and premium reductions, lowered lender-placed premiums.","Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions revenue partially offset the decline. Net earned premium and fees for multi-family housing were up more than 20%. We achieved this increase through our affinity channel and expanded relationships with property management companies. Mortgage solutions revenue increased 28% primarily from strong organic growth in field services.","In the first quarter these fee-based, capital-light offerings generated a pre-tax margin of 11%, an increase of 620 basis points year-over-year. Strong organic growth is helping build the additional scale needed to reach our long-term target margin of 15% to 20%. For the year, we expect revenue and earnings to be down at Specialty Property as lender-placed continues to normalize.","Expense savings and growth in our fee-based, capital-light offerings are expected to partially offset the decline in net operating income. Turning to Health runoff operations, the segment reported a first-quarter loss of $27 million, which was in line with our estimates. This included $10 million in severance-related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves.","During the quarter, we were able to dividend $65 million from Health to the holding company. We expect to dividend an additional $410 million later this year. This is subject to regulatory approval, any changes in claims experience, and the final payments from the 2015 ACA risk mitigation programs.","As of March 31, we had $487 million of recoverables related to the risk mitigation programs at Health. In the first quarter, we received an initial payment of $29 million related to the 2015 reinsurance program, and we received another $38 million payment last week. HHS is expected to provide insurers with their final payment notifications by the end of June and pay the remaining reimbursements starting in the third quarter.","Moving to Corporate, the loss for the quarter increased $10 million to $14 million, reflecting higher taxes and employee benefit costs. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 benefited from a tax consolidating adjustment that reversed itself during the course of last year. For full year 2016, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. The actions we are taking to build the new business' operating framework and to eliminate residual expenses from Health and Employee Benefits will support a more efficient operating model for the future.","Moving to Capital, we ended the first quarter with $200 million in deployable capital. In addition to the $65 million from Health that I referenced earlier, we brought up $55 million in dividends from Solutions and Specialty Property during the quarter.","We also secured $250 million in short-term financing to fund share repurchases. This provided additional capital flexibility until cash proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits are received at the holding company. These actions allowed us to pay $32 million in shareholder dividends and repurchase $258 million worth of stock. Through April 22, we bought an additional 807,000 shares, bringing the total repurchased year-to-date to $4.2 million. So far this year, buyback activity already surpassed the full-year 2015 total.","At the same time, we believe ongoing cash flow generation from Solutions and Specialty Property will provide continued financial flexibility to support our current and future opportunities in the housing and lifestyle markets. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results and are committed to executing our transformation strategy to ensure long-term profitable growth in housing and lifestyle. And with that operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Kovac, with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. At the Investor Day, Assurant outlined targets in both Specialty Property and Solutions, and you've given us some updates in terms of how you're tracking in Property, but we don't see the same sort of level of disclosure in Solutions. I'm wondering if you could provide us any incremental details in terms of the mobile margins; I know that the long-term target is 8% margins relative to 4% in 2015? And the same on the Vehicle combined ratio?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, good morning Mike and appreciate the question. As we go through this year, we are going to continue to evolve our disclosures and one of the challenges as we evolve disclosures in Solutions is just the complexity of the global business. And so that's why we're able to get Property out this quarter and be comfortable with it. We're still working on getting the Solutions numbers out that we can be comfortable and repeatable. But I think in \u2013 the short answer to your question, if we look at Connected Living, we had said last year we were at about a 4% margin for the year pre-tax; we're still trending in line with that and continue to expect over time we'll grow to that 8% margin that we've laid out in Investor Day.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That makes sense. And then Chris discussed some of the ramp-up of expenses in Solutions related to the new program launches, which we know were a drag in the fourth quarter. When I look at the expense ratio, obviously down sequentially and not really up all that much year-over-year. Can you give us a sense of how far through that ramp you are and sort of the scale of the expenses this quarter?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, the expenses, Mike, in Q1 are still up but lower than they were in Q4. We'll incur some additional expenses in Q2 and then, in the second half of the year we'll start to see the program generate profitable revenue. Again, this is kind of a normal course. I think the first \u2013 fourth quarter was a little bit of an anomaly in terms of the amount of the expenses, but we feel like we're back on track now to generate again NOI growth year-over-year and then the longer-term 10% average NOI growth in Solutions.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Seth.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Seth.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. If I could follow up on Mike's questions on Solutions and just trying to get some context around the top-line improvements in global Connected Living. If we look at the $660 million number in premiums and fees, it's running ahead of the quarterly pace of 2014 and 2015. So the top-line trend there seems to be positive, but just trying to get context around how we think about that for earnings because obviously your best quarter in terms of top-line was the last quarter in the fourth quarter, but that was a relatively poor earnings quarter?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. So a couple of comments. First of all, we \u2013 as we've talked about on previous calls, we feel very good about the momentum and progress in the mobile business. If you recall last year, we announced a variety of new clients and new programs and that's what starting to drive up the top-line and will continue to drive up the top-line.","The challenge in the earnings is, we also have in there the rotation that's going on with the legacy retailers that are in runoff and that's a drag on the earnings, and then all the things that we talked about in the fourth quarter. But the momentum in the top-line I think augurs very well for why we believe this business will continue to scale and drive toward that 8% margin for Connected Living over time.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is that top-line indicative of how we should think about growth and earnings if we think about it longer-term? I know there's complexities on the accounting in terms of what's flowing through the top-line and what's flowing as rebates on the expense line?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","It is a complicated thing. I think the direction we've given is that margins are going to expand over time in Connected Living. It won't be exactly linear because as a program comes in or we have changes in what we're doing that will cause some variability in that growth, but it will expand over time and increasingly, attractive business for us as we go forward.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. And if I could ask one quickly on Health, if my math's right, you have about $420 million left in recoverables from HHS, if we back out the payments that were made in the first quarter and what Chris commented on second quarter, so if we think about the $410 million that's left to upstream, how dependent is that on getting the full payment from HHS?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I think \u2013 the way I think about those numbers, the estimates around the recoverables are going to be \u2013 when those receivables convert to cash, that's going to be the dividend that will be available at Health. So we expect to hear at the end of the second quarter from HHS on the final numbers relative to our estimate. And then as those dividends come in the second half we'll take them up. So it is \u2013 it is the \u2013 right now, the primary risk in terms of our \u2013 the capital plan, we feel very good about actual results at Health.","So the actual claims experience from the 2015 policies is now that the range of outcomes is narrowing and it's \u2013 really and then remember the risk adjuster estimate is the one that's got a little bit more potential variability, because it's us relative to the market, as opposed to the reinsurance recoverable, which is effectively a quota share.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Do we want to think about that as both upside or downside risk, or should we just really think about that as downside risk going into June?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, again we've taken in \u2013 this is our best estimate, I guess is the way to think about it, and feel \u2013 with again, the big risk being absolute claims experiences is getting \u2013 is more and more in the rearview mirror, which is a good thing from a risk perspective.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Jimmy.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Jimmy.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. So the first question on \u2013 was just on margins in the Specialty Property business. Seems like margins this quarter were very strong. So to what extent do you think of that as a normal number versus maybe just benefiting from either benign weather or something else?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I think, we're obviously pleased with the strong results in the first quarter, but we did have very favorable non-cat loss experience, which was the benign weather. We have ongoing lender-placed normalization that will continue. One of the positives in the quarter is the improvement in the margins in our fee-based businesses, which continue \u2013 particularly mortgage solutions continue to strengthen as we grow that business. But no, I think we had better than expected long-term non-cat loss in the first quarter.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then on share buybacks. I think you mentioned deployable capital at the holding company of $200 million. Should we think of that as the limitation on your ability to buy back stock in the second quarter? Or would you have more capital available as depending on the timing of when some of the Employee Benefits proceeds move up to holdco?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, I wouldn't consider it a limitation. Again we \u2013 and our strategy around buybacks didn't wait for the money to arrive at the holding company from the sale of the Benefits business. It is sitting in legal entities. We expect to request dividends in the second quarter from both Benefits and an ongoing dividend request from Health. We've also again \u2013 we took $55 million of dividends from \u2013 the combine from Specialty Property and Solutions.","So, again the cash \u2013 the generation of cash and the line of sight around those cash flows is becoming clearer. Also keep in mind that in addition to the after-tax proceeds from the Benefits sale, we're going to have some capital release in the second half of 2016 in Benefits and then the $400 million-plus of capital coming out of Health once we receive the reinsurance and risk mitigation recoverables.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the cash proceeds from the sale would be moving up in the second quarter that \u2013 the capital release is a little bit later, right? The cash proceeds being about $650 million?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yes. That's correct. So, the \u2013 again, couple of things. So, again, subject to regulatory approval, we're going to file our Q1 stat (25:54) returns and then make the request for the dividend. We are not anticipating a problem, but again, it is still subject to regulatory approval.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning John.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, John.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey, good morning, Alan. And good morning, Chris. A couple of quick questions. I'm curious, when you think about the $70 million operating loss you expect for Corporate in 2016. As we think further out, Alan, how much of that $70 million relates to residual costs from the Health and the Benefits business that you'd expect over time you can either take out of the organization or redeploy into growth areas?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me start with kind of what we said at Investor Day and then, Chris, you can comment more on this. What we said in Investor Day is we have taken aggressive and decisive action to offset the \u2013 the residual cost or the legacy cost and a good example of that was the hard pension freeze that went in place in March. We've also had a series of reductions, as we've been \u2013 begun to really integrate our key support functions, and all of that gives us confidence that over time, we'll be able to drive real expense efficiencies that will more than offset the residual expenses. But Chris, what would you add?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, just a couple comments on that. So in the $70 million is the expectation we're going to assume some of the residual costs from the Benefits business for the quarters two, three and four. Health remains an ongoing operation, we'll address the residual costs from the Health segment starting in 2017. So, we have a line of sight of what needs to happen, but as Alan described as we talked about it at Investor Day, our targets are much higher than that. Again, the goal to being to build a more efficient operating model, so that we can not just save money, but support growth going forward.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the other thing I would add on this is, we are really focused on setting the company up for a sustained growth in earnings, which is what we've talked about as one of the three long-term targets for the company. The way we get there is through this evolution of our businesses and the focus of the resources on the attractive growth businesses, which you've seen us doing and ongoing, combined with the actions we're taking to get to a more agile, efficient operating structure. For example the IT integration that we'll able to drive now with Ajay coming on board to lead that. Opportunities we have in front of us in procurement and then the move to an integrated operating structure that Gene will lead effective in July. So we feel very good about the progress toward not just getting out the residual expenses but going far beyond that as we grow the company.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","No. That's helpful color. Thank you, Alan. The second question, maybe it just comes down to timing, but I just want to make sure that there is no change here. And so I'll ask it this way, if I think about the $55 million of dividends up to the parent in the quarter from Solutions and Specialty Property, so excluding the Health piece.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's much less than 100% of the earnings from those two segments if I think about the earnings either from the fourth quarter with a one-quarter delay or if I think about 1Q's earnings. So is it just a matter of timing or is there some change to the expectation around how much in dividends you can get up?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","No change, John, I mean this has been our typical (29:33) pattern, we have backend-loaded again the big risk in Property typically being what this cat season looks like. So, but you're correct in saying that there are some earnings in the segments in aggregate available to be dividended up from the first quarter. So, I think that's a fair way to characterize it. In addition to what we've talked about with respect to the proceeds from Benefits, the capital release from Benefits and also the capital release from Health.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And then Alan, you mentioned having something to tell us about a CFO hire within the next few months. I'm just curious whether you've actually landed at or arrived at a decision and it's just too early to be able to announce it, maybe this person is still in a position elsewhere, or if it's just your expectation that the process will conclude within the next few months?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we're in the middle of a process, and I feel very good about the quality of the candidates that are interested in Assurant and that we're interested in and we're confident that we'll be able to announce something relatively soon, and have that person on board in the coming months. In the meantime though, we're very fortunate to have Chris in the chair, and Chris is an ongoing part of our management team, very crucial to our future. But, no, I feel good about the process and expect to be able to say something in the near future.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you, good...","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. The mortgage solutions, of the 28% growth, how much of that was organic, roughly?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All of it was organic at this point because we acquired those companies, Field Services [Field Asset Services] in particular in 2013 and the other two were in 2014. Now the one thing I would say is we had a relatively softer first quarter a year ago. So, that's part of the reason, but we still feel very good about the growth and momentum in those businesses.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","The Vehicle Protection also got very good growth there, how much would you say is industry growth that's helping you there or do you feel like you're taking share?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think both of the things you just said are correct. We've had a very good strategy of focusing on particularly the car manufacturers, the OEMs and you heard us announce a couple of those last year; we've won major new programs. So part of it is absolutely share gain, and part of it has been the market, but very strong growth in that business over the last couple years, something around \u2013 I don't know if we've disclosed it \u2013 around 15% year-on-year. That's in our new supplement, right?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And then just another thing on the Vehicle business. Again, that is revenue growth that will begin to earn 18 months to 36 months out, when the manufacturer's warranty expires, so this is future profitability from growth that's going on now.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. When I think about your Solutions business, if I think of it on, say, a pre-tax basis, you're pretty much at the run rate you were last year. Your guidance is for the Solutions earnings to be up. I think you've talked about the potential for a ramp in the top line given the new programs you've got coming on line. Does your guidance look a little conservative or are there some additional expenses that might be offsetting some of that mobile ramp-up? How should I think about that?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I think, just a couple of thoughts. The thing we're really focused on with that business broadly is the 10% average annual growth in net operating income over time. For this year, I think our outlook remains the same, which is the first quarter was in line with our expectations. We really expect that ramp-up in earnings to happen in the second half of the year, so that full year earnings will be up. But that's \u2013 with the visibility we have at the moment, that's where we're comfortable providing an outlook.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie. Your line is open","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Sean.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my call \u2013 my question, rather. I just have a question about thinking of the walk-through of Property results over the course of 2016. I know it's hard to model non-cat losses or the favorability of non-cat losses, but in addition to weather, is there anything that drove that in the first quarter? I think I heard something about vandalism \u2013 are people not trashing their homes when they default on their mortgages as much or \u2013 I'm just wondering if there's some sort of secular shift in distressed properties that's leading to a more favorable non-cat loss ratio?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, I think \u2013 again, there are two components. One is weather, non-cat, weather-related and this other issue, fire and vandalism. And we're seeing slight improvements in the fire and vandalism components, so potentially a sustainable reduction in the non-cat loss ratio. But it really is driven by mild weather. So, I don't want to \u2013 wouldn't want to read into that too much, I don't want to get into that business of predicting what mother nature is going to do out \u2013 for the rest of the year. So, but again, good results, a big driver of the positive outcome in the first quarter.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The other thing I'd add is \u2013 I think we feel we've made significant progress kind of transforming the lender-placed business as it normalizes, both taking down our expenses, redoing our systems to really maintain our very market-leading best-in-the-industry solutions. And the long-term guidance we've given around the risk expense ratio of 42% to 44%, we still feel is appropriate and it's not going to be linear quarter-to-quarter.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. And just thinking about the directional organic growth of mortgage solution revenue, should we look to total mortgage origination estimates as the single biggest driver, is there a correlation between total origination including refis and purchase in a given quarter and what that revenue will be?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, yes and no is the answer. We've said longer-term we expect somewhere in the range of 8% to 12% kind of organic growth for our business over time in mortgage solutions. Some of our services are driven and linked to origination activity like the appraisals we do, but the majority of what we do is not related to new purchases, it's related to the houses that are in default or are in REO-type status, we think about our field services. So we are not that linked to mortgage originations, but we do expect over time as we continue to gain share and demonstrate the value of our capabilities and our compliance that we'll grow that business 8% to 12% a year on the top line.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. I think the key there is this \u2013 the investment thesis around the mortgage solutions business was the share gain, leveraging our relationships with the mortgage servicers, expanding our product offerings when we gain share, the growth will then allow us to improve operating margins and deliver the value proposition.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, John.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, John.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for the taking the second round here. I guess the only question I have remaining is thinking about the normalization of lender-placed in, if we thought about it in the sense of a baseball game, how far into that baseball game ROE. I mean \u2013 and I know the placement rate continues to come down very, very gradually, but what's also so interesting is that the tracked \u2013 the number of tracked mortgages is really holding very, very steady. I'm just \u2013 I'm especially interested in what's going on underneath the hood of the tracked mortgages, the ins and outs there?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I'll start by caveating our ability to estimate the timing of lender-placed normalization because we've struggled with that over time. But I think it's fair to say that we are more done than not done at this point. If you think about that placement rate, which was 2.24% in the last quarter, we are now expecting and continue to expect that we end up somewhere in the 1.8% to 2.1%. So we're closer to that than we were at the high point which was almost 3%.","In terms of the tracked loans we have, I think the industry-leading solution and a great track record and we've been able to sustain our position in the market over time.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Has there been any \u2013 if we thought about an inflow and outflow around that $33.3 million or $33.4 million number? Has there been any sort of underlying runoff that's been replaced essentially by taking on modest-sized portfolios?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I think if you look at the overall number, the loans are still moving around between the various servicers we're well-positioned in general whereever (38:55) that happens. There is a gradual attrition in the backlog as the foreclosure crisis is worked through. But we continue to feel we are the preferred option in the industry and in terms of your broader question, what we said at Investor Day is we think normalization pretty much is complete by 2018 and we're already seeing that for example as we talked about at Investor Day, rate actions to this point are more than normal course of working with the regulators just reflecting experience in markets. So we're already seeing some of that normalization pretty far along.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","And when you think about, the last point I wanted to get to was on premium rates and I believe that you guys had mentioned a more modest rate reduction in the State of Florida, I don't remember exactly the number or the timing of that, could you just remind us?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, again Alan mentioned we're in normal course annual rate reviews with Florida in particular, New York as well. We filed and are waiting to hear from Florida in terms of \u2013 but again, keep in mind a couple of things. Again ,we're an important source of protection \u2013 cat protection in the state. We have a very good relationship with the state, they appreciate our providing capital into that market. The other thing to remember is we haven't had a big storm in quite a while, and that's not going to continue, at some point that will happen, we'll honor the claims, we'll provide the financial support to our policyholders and do what we're set up to do, which is protect homeowners.","John M.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2019 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday, after the market close, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter 2019. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com.","As noted in both documents, we updated our key financial metrics for the enterprise and our operating segments to align with the company's strategic focus, and the financial objective shared at our recent Investor Day. We believe these metrics will be a better indicator of performance going forward. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.","During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement.","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we are pleased with our results for the first quarter. Performance across our three operating segments was strong, especially mobile and Global Lifestyle. Our results reaffirm our belief that we are well-positioned to sustain our performance long term. Our leadership positions and innovative offerings should continue to support double-digit earnings growth, with a more diversified and higher quality mix of business.","During the quarter, we continue to execute on our strategy. In Global Housing, we've repositioned the segment for growth. First, by beginning to stabilize and replace, and second, by continuing to drive profitable growth within multi-family housing and our other specialty property offerings.","In multi-family housing, we grew revenue 7% in both our affinity and property management partners now protecting 2.1 million renters protecting across the US. Our focus remains on investing in our key capabilities to deliver even more value for our clients and their renters. To that end, we continue to rollout our new point-of-lease tracking capability to seamlessly integrate our products and services, and gradually increase attachment rates.","With our vertically integrated capabilities, broad product suite and emphasis on the customer experience, we've built a leading position in the PMC channel. We continue to expect strong top and bottom line growth going forward. We've also further strengthened our leading lender-placed franchise by renewing three key partnerships in the quarter, and over the past five months, the renewals completed represent nearly one-third of our loans tracked.","This bodes well for the future as lender-placed earnings have started to stabilize after years of market declines. Over the next three years, we believe we will generate a 17% to 20% operating ROE, including an average expected cat load.","In Global Lifestyle, we are aligned with leading brands to bring innovative products and services to market. In Connected Living, this includes services like our premium tech support, which creates greater value for the end consumer and adds new and important profit pools. We now protect more than 47 million covered mobile devices, up 26% year-over-year.","As we highlighted at our Investor Day, our new partnerships with companies like Verizon, Comcast, Charter, KDDI and the renewal and expansion of our T-Mobile relationship to include Metro by T-Mobile demonstrate that our vertically integrated capabilities continue to drive value for our customers and serve as a significant differentiator for Assurant.","We made additional progress integrating The Warranty Group acquisition, realizing operating synergies as planned and finding ways to unlock additional value from our stronger, more scalable global automotive business. For example, this quarter, we introduced Pocket Drive, our new technology platform that will expand our offerings beyond service contracts.","We expect to launch pilot testing in the second quarter with select dealer partners. We are pleased by the continued strong revenue growth and innovation in this business for the 48 million vehicles we protect worldwide. This also supports our long-term view that we can continue to grow Global Lifestyle's net operating income at least 10% annually on average over the next three years.","Turning to Global Preneed, we produced solid, consistent earnings and cash flows in the quarter, supported by our growth and pre-funded funeral policies and favorable mortality trends. Base sales were also strong with a 7% year-over-year increase from new distribution partners within our Final Need product.","Over the next three years, we believe we can achieve a sustainable operating ROE of 13% in Global Preneed. In addition to setting these long-term segment targets at our Investor Day, we also provided several key enterprise financial objectives. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, we expect to grow earnings per share on average by 12% with double-digit expansion in net operating income.","In addition, starting in 2019, we intend to return $1.35 billion to shareholders over the next three years in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends, illustrating the confidence we have in our future cash flows. We recognize that executing against our plans for 2019 will be an important step in delivering on these long-term targets.","For this year, we continue to expect to grow operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, by 6% to 10% from the $8.65 we reported in 2018. This will be driven by double-digit earnings growth and disciplined capital deployment.","Looking at results for the first quarter 2019, we reported a net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes of $2.33, an increase of 9% from $2.14 in the prior year period. This was driven by earnings growth, partially offset by shares issued last year related to our TWG acquisition.","Net operating income, also excluding catastrophes, for the quarter was up 30% to $149 million, due to TWG contributions and organic business growth. At the end of March, holding company liquidity totaled $354 million, after returning $51 million in share repurchases and $37 million in common stock dividends.","Overall, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We're confident in our ability to continue to expand earnings and cash flow. This will allow us to continue to invest in our business and sustain our track record of returning excess capital to shareholders over the long term.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review segment results and our 2019 outlook in greater detail. Richard?","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $73 million, an increase of $2 million from the first quarter of 2018. Excluding mortgage solutions, in the prior year period, earnings declined as growth in multi-family housing was offset by higher catastrophe costs and decreased profitability in our specialty property offerings.","Lower earnings in our specialty property offerings were mainly the result of higher non-cat loss experience in our small commercial property products. For the segment, reportable catastrophes in the quarter totaled $9 million, level with last year. Global Housing revenue was down, reflecting the sale of mortgage solutions. Excluding mortgage solutions, revenue was up 5% due to growth in small commercial products, multi-family housing and our sharing economy offerings.","Lender-placed revenue decreased due to lower placement rates, partially offset by higher premium rates. During the quarter, the placement rate declined 13 basis points year-over-year and only two basis points from year-end 2018, in line with our expectations. As noted earlier, we have revised our financial supplement disclosure following Investor Day.","Specifically for housing, we've aligned our key financial metrics to report the loss, expense and combined ratios for the entire segment. For the first quarter, the combined ratio for Global Housing was unchanged from the prior year period at 86.7%. This falls within our longer-term range of 86% to 90%, including an average expected capital. For full year 2019, we continue to expect Global Housing to realize modest earnings growth, excluding cat losses. This will be driven by continued expansion of our specialty offerings, most notably, multi-family housing.","As we look to the second quarter, we expect higher non-cat loss ratios reflecting typical weather patterns and we will monitor the elevated loss experience in the small commercial products. Lender-placed earnings will reflect the additional reinsurance coverage we secured earlier this year, but underlying profitability is expected to remain stable. We also continue the process of migrating clients to our new operating platform, as this will lower expenses longer term, and more importantly, further enhances the customer experience.","Moving to Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $101 million for the first quarter, a $45 million increase year-over-year. This reflects $30 million after-tax from TWG, including $10 million of realized synergies and $2.8 million of intangible amortization.","We also benefited from strong organic growth in the business, led by Connected Living, which grew earnings by 64% in the quarter. This was mainly due to mobile subscriber growth from programs launched over the past two years. In addition, we realized higher trading volumes from carrier promotions and strong margins in repair and logistics.","Segment earnings were also supported by more favorable Global Automotive results for legacy Assurant, compared to the prior period, which was marked by some higher one-time expenses. Looking at total revenue for this segment, net earned premiums and fees were up $763 million, mainly from the $651 million TWG contribution. Excluding TWG, revenue was up $112 million or 12%.","Organic revenue growth was driven primarily by mobile programs launched during the past two years, mainly in Asia-Pacific and North America. This growth was across various distribution channels and from multiple profit pools, including device protection, premium tech support, as well as repair and logistics.","Auto revenue, excluding TWG, was up 20%, benefiting from strong prior period sales in our TPA distribution. Foreign exchange volatility, primarily from unfavorable currency movements in Argentina and Brazil, partially offset growth in the quarter.","Looking at the full year, we continue to expect strong earnings growth due to the full year TWG contributions, including $25 million to $30 million of incremental expense synergies, mainly in Global Automotive.","In addition, mobile should remain a significant contributor through gaining growth from new and existing programs. It's important to note that the first quarter was particularly strong compared to last year, reflecting the timing of new phone introductions and carrier promotions.","For the balance of the year, we expect typical mobile seasonality and some additional pressure from anticipated declines in our legacy credit business within financial services, investments to enhance and strengthen our capabilities, particularly in mobile and auto, will also be important as we look to stay on the forefront of innovation for the future.","Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $12 million of net operating income, a $2 million year-over-year increase. Higher investment income and lower mortality compared to the prior year period were the key drivers. Revenue in Preneed was up 6%, mainly driven by growth in US, including sales of our Final Need product. Global Preneed's outlook for the year remains unchanged with earnings roughly flat with 2018.","We will continue to manage expenses closely, as we implement the segment's long-term growth strategy, drive more sales to our home [ph] distribution, work with new partners and expand our portfolio of products. At Corporate, the net operating loss was $19 million, relatively flat with the prior year period. For full year 2019, we expect the net operating loss to be similar to 2018, creating additional leverage with our expense structure as we grow.","Turing to capital, we ended March with $354 million of holding company liquidity or about $129 million above our current minimum target level of $225 million. Dividends in the quarter from our operating segments totaled $78 million, lower than segment earnings as we typically wait till later in the year for greater visibility.","In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, the outflows included $51 million in share repurchases, $42 million in common and preferred dividends and $8 million of investments, including strengthening our repair and logistic capabilities in Canada.","In the second quarter through May 3rd, we purchased an additional 224,000 shares for $21 million. For full year 2019, we expect dividends from our operating segments to approximate segment operating earnings. These dividends should provide flexibility to invest in our businesses, and return capital to shareholders, subject to market conditions.","While our 2019 capital deployment plans take into account our potential purchase of Ike Asistencia in light of our investment in TWG, we are evaluating how Ike fits into our expanded Latin American operations. We are exploring strategic options for Ike and have delayed the put call option until February of 2020 to complete our review.","In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance in the first quarter. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from John Nadel from UBS.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning, John.","John Nadel","Good morning. I have a couple of questions and then I'll get back in the queue. One that I'm curious about the number of renters policies, that's growing really solid double-digit year-over-year, I think the growth rate this quarter was 13%, 13.5%, but your actual net earned premium is growing high-single. Is there just a lag effect there that I'm missing or is there some pricing competition going on?","Richard Dziadzio","Hey, John, good morning. It's Richard.","John Nadel","Good morning.","Richard Dziadzio","I think there is probably the two parts of it. I think first of all, we're expanding in the property management channel, I mean, we have really good growth and strong growth. As we said in - Alan said in his remarks, we're investing in that channel to stay at the forefront of innovation and allowing renters to come in and on-board more quickly.","So there is some expense there. I think there's probably two fold, I mean, we're being very competitive in the market, but also there is a lag effect between when we bring on, we are writing the premium when the premium flows through, but I would say, no big changes in margins that we've seen.","John Nadel","Okay, that's helpful. And then, just one housekeeping item. Is that your outlook for 2019. I'm just curious we've seen that property reinsurance costs, particularly in the State of Florida are up pretty significantly. I just wonder whether you already knew that had that big in to your outlook or if that was more of an estimate, and is there any impact we should expect as it relates to your outlook for reinsurance costs, impacting your overall outlook for '19?","Alan Colberg","Hi, John. Yeah, thanks for the question. And actually we did, I think the market had some visibility in terms of the cat cost in Florida, the cost of the hurricane - Florida Hurricane Cat Fund. So we have a, I say a large part of that in to it. As we come into the year, might be a tiny bit higher, but nothing that would impact our outlook whatsoever.","Richard Dziadzio","John, the other thing that we talked about at Investor Day, we've really expanded the multi-year component of our reinsurance, which really stabilizes cost for us over time.","John Nadel","Got you, that's helpful. Thank you. And then the last one, I'm just thinking how did - overall, how did 1Q earnings compare with your own sort of internal expectations, it sounds to me like you're signaling that, in particular, connected living had a pretty solid, maybe favorable quarter.","How should we think about - you talked about seasonality. You talked about a little bit higher loss ratios as we move from 1Q into 2Q for that particular business, how can we - can you help us by sizing maybe in a dollar amount or a range, how we should think about that earnings of - for connected living from 1Q to 2Q?","Alan Colberg","Yeah. So, certainly, if we look at the quarter, we're pleased by the results and mobile was stronger than we had expected, really driven by trade in volumes. The late introduction in Q4, some of the smartphones push volume into Q1, more than we had expected.","So as we head into Q2, we will have seasonality in connected living both in the normal summer, where we just have a greater loss experience and then trade in volumes usually slowdown in Q2 and Q3 as people are anticipating the next smartphone introductions.","John Nadel","How to - is any chance we can talk about how to think about that in terms of dollar amount of earning, typical seasonality as it is like a 5% quarter-over-quarter decline, and...","Alan Colberg","It's hard for us to predict that, but I would say as we remain very confident in our long-term outlook that we've given for Lifestyle, which is that 10% plus average annual mortgage growth that we have a lot of confidence in quarter-to-quarter, it's harder to predict.","John Nadel","Got you. Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christopher Campbell from KBW. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning.","Christopher Campbell","Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter.","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you.","Christopher Campbell","First question is just on the higher-than-expected losses in housing, I guess how much of the year-over-year increase was due to the higher commercial losses?","Richard Dziadzio","It was due to - I'm sorry.","Christopher Campbell","The higher attritional, like specialty property losses.","Richard Dziadzio","Yeah, I mean there was a part in there due to that, I mean that was I would say, the primary part that - the loss ratio year-over-year as we have sort of pointed out, that's within, just for everyone, that sort of within the specialty property component of housing, which was about $120 million to $500 million and specialty commercial property part is about 20%, 25% and that was a small component, and we didn't have great experience to get increase in severity in that book of business and as we've said, we are monitoring it as we go forward.","Christopher Campbell","Got it. And is that more attritional or was it just large losses this quarter?","Alan Colberg","Really an increase in severity, I would say in the book, no huge several big things, but an increase in severity overall.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. And then question on repurchases. I mean is $50 million a good quarterly run rate to think about going forward?","Alan Colberg","So, I think the way I think about that question is, we've said that we expect over the next three years to return $1.35 billion to shareholders via common stock, dividends and repurchases, that translates into roughly $300 million a year over the three years in repurchases. We have to remember, we buy via 10b5-1 and so we can't go in and out of the market that easily.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, thanks. And then just in mobile, I mean any new clients or relationship extensions that you guys are looking at? I mean, how does the sales pipeline look relative to last year?","Alan Colberg","I think we're very pleased with our progress in mobile. You heard in my prepared remarks, I rave about these four or five major new clients that we've started relationships with in the last 18 to 24 months.","And as I mentioned at Investor Day, we will be ramping up later this year with Metro by T-Mobile, which has the potential for about 3 million subs to be added over time to our portfolio. So we're very focused on executing on that, but the pipeline remains strong. Our innovative offerings have really differentiated us and giving us a lot of traction in the market.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, great. And then just, I know you guys have talked about like 5G being like a possible tailwind like further out, I guess, just any additional clarity that you have on the development of 5G and then the impact - the potential impact on your business?","Alan Colberg","Got it. In 5G, what we've talked about is ultimately when that gains real consumer traction, there will be a handset replacement cycle that will occur. I think it's still quite a ways in the future if you look at the timing of the rollout of 5G, but that is a long-term tailwind that will help the business at some point.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, great. Well, thanks for all the answers. Best of luck in the second quarter.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Chris.","Richard Dziadzio","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our last question is coming from John Nadel from UBS. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey, John.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning. It seems everybody's tied up on AIG this morning. Sorry, guys, but I care. So...","Alan Colberg","We appreciate that. Thank you, John.","John Nadel","If we - I am curious your commentary and I appreciate your commentary around the delay of the put call option on Ike into early 2020. I guess - I'm more curious about how - you talked about evaluating how that business within given the given the acquisition of TWG and the integration you've got going on. Can you - like, can you expand on those thoughts a little bit? I know you don't want to get ahead of things here, but I'm just curious what that means?","Alan Colberg","Yeah. So John, let me provide a little context. So when we originally signed the agreement, which was in late 2013, and it's really all about creating more scale for our business in Latin America, which we - in key markets like Mexico, that's a priority.","With The Warranty Group acquisition, we added dramatically more scale in the key markets like Mexico and Argentina and Brazil, and given that, it causes us to step back and say, how do we think about this business. Now, it's important to note over the five years, we've been involved, the business has performed well.","It's actually slightly ahead of the expectations we had when we made the original investment. But we have scale now in Latin America. So it's a good chance for us to step back and think about what's best for our shareholders.","John Nadel","Got it, understood, okay. And then Alan, one of the - I guess one of the critics that I hear from time to time and based on the disclosures that we get from you guys. I think it's not so easy to counter this critique, is an overarching belief that your position. And I'm talking about Lifestyle here, your position, Assurant's position in the value chain is one that suffers maybe from lower economic relative to maybe a service provider like a Verizon or another, and that the growth as you grow, your incremental margin may actually be lower.","Is that a fair critique or is there some way that you can provide some data that counters that? I think that's one thing that weighs a little bit, your growth rate is - the top line growth rate looks terrific, right? I mean, in particular these last couple of quarters. I'm just trying to - I'm trying to see if there's a way to counter that overarching belief or perception.","Alan Colberg","I don't think that's at all the way we think about the business. So we're aligned with the market leaders. We are expanding our whole and providing services to them. We've talked about the addition of major new services in the last 18 months, like premium tech support.","And if you look at the long-term, we have grown earnings in that business, 10% plus over the last six years, with an outlook that we're going to continue to be able to do that. So it's a very good business where we are critically important to our partners and delivering the consumer experiences they want.","And so we don't tend to think about the margin of each service, because some of them are fee income, some are not. But we look at it and can we continue to grow profitably, and expand and deepen our relationships with our key clients, which we've done very well.","John Nadel","And if we think about Lifestyle discreetly, can you remind us what your return target is for that particular segment?","Alan Colberg","We don't have one, because what we've said matters in Lifestyle. It's not a traditional insurance business. So thinking about returns is not the way to think about it. What we have said is, we can grow earnings and we've done it for six plus years and we can continue to do it. Now, we've said overall for the enterprise, we will be disciplined in that growth with overall enterprise ROE gradually rising over the next three years. But for Lifestyle, specifically it's about profitable earnings growth.","John Nadel","Got you. And the last one I have for you, you talked about this some time ago, I don't remember if at Investor Day, there was any real commentary around this, but I'm thinking about Global Auto and the potential that there may be some opportunity to drive down repair costs given your better size and scale and maybe some ability to renegotiate some contracts with repair facilities dealership.","I'm just wondering if there's any update on that front. I know it's not something that - I know you did not build in anything from that and essential stream into your synergies. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on any progress.","Alan Colberg","John, appreciate question. Let me maybe start just a little more broadly on the TWG synergies, and then I'll come to that one specifically. If you recall, when we did the deal, we announced that we had a hard cost synergy target of $60 million run rate pre-tax by the end of 2019.","We are on track and we expect we will deliver that by the end of this year. With that said then, we've really turned a lot of our focus to other sources of synergy ranging from revenue synergies. One of the things we recently rolled out in Japan as the partnership of KDDI around our connected home, we're leveraging our relationship with the legacy Warranty Group capabilities to deliver in the home in Japan.","So that's an example of a revenue synergy that they were going hard after, and on the claims costs absolutely, we now have an extraordinarily strong position in the market, leveraging our knowledge of the cards with the payers, these things that go on. And so we're looking to how do we leverage that now, a lot of that benefit will flow to our clients and many of our programs are reinsured or quota shared with our clients. But that strengthens our relationships with those clients and we'll get some benefits.","So we're early days on those, it takes time to implement that. But it's another significant source of synergy that as you said, it's not reflected when we talked about the expectations for the TWG deal.","John Nadel","Got it. And since you still have plenty of time, I may as well throw one more in. If I think about the migration on the lender-place side, the migration to a single operating platform, I know you don't - you haven't really quantified what spend you think can be generated from that over time.","I'm wondering if you could give us the sense - it doesn't sound like it's that big of a contributor in 2019. I'm wondering, 2020 and beyond, if you think that could be a material impact to the earnings for Global Housing?","Richard Dziadzio","Yeah, John. Hi, it's Rich. I will take that one. We are starting to on-board clients, we are getting some good reactions from the clients. I mean, first and foremost, our investment in the program is to position us for a great customer experience going forward and investment we've made is being well received.","So I think that's probably the biggest point on that. It's a multi-year project, and I think as we look forward, I don't think there will be a threshold moment where in 2020, we would see a big impact of expenses. But it would be over time and over, I would say over the next years.","On the other hand, I think as you look at the overall expense ratio for the housing area, we are really managing expenses tightly both in the housing area, but overall as a company as you've seen, also in our overall corporate loss and stability there.","Alan Colberg","John, the important thing on lender-placed, I think for everyone to remember is we've now said that we've got that business more stable with significant upside, if we get into an account audit downside. Specifically, on our single source platform for 2019, it's a modest amount. It's really more about as Richard said, the longer term and the consumer experience.","John Nadel","And that expense ratio for that segment, should we see that coming down over the next couple of years? And is this maybe part of that driver?","Alan Colberg","I mean, it's hard to predict now where the expense margin is going to go. I think when we look at the overall expense ratio in the first quarter, also taking into account the variety of businesses within it, whether it would be lender-placed, multi-family, whatever, we have brought it down, managing it well.","What I expect to go down in the future as we get through the single source platform, I would expect it to go down, but it's hard today to kind of predict what would happen in 2020, exactly.","John Nadel","Okay. Maybe it's just the redefinition or redefining the segment loss ratio, expense ratio, combined ratio, but I thought you guys used - previously, you were talking about two to four points over time of expense ratio reduction, is that no longer the case or is that just been, like yes, muted or hidden if you will by the aggregation of that expense ratio for the total segment?","Richard Dziadzio","I think John, what I would say is we still feel very good about the long-term impact of that and we've reaffirmed that 86% to 90% combined ratio over time for the segment.","John Nadel","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you so much.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, John. All right, well, thanks everyone for participating in today's call. We're pleased with our first quarter performance and believe we're off to a strong start for the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter earnings call in August. In the meantime, please reach out to Suzanne Shepherd or Sean Moshier with any follow-up questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

And the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Executive Vice President, Chief Communication and Marketing Officer. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi - EVP, Chief Communication and Marketing Officer","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2015 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. Beginning last quarter, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only in net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income.","We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results, until the sale of that business is closed, which we expect to occur by the end of the first quarter 2016.","Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on those measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com. We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A.","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2014 Form 10-K, first quarter and second quarter and upcoming third quarter Form 10-Q.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Alan.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Our housing and lifestyle specialty protection businesses within Solutions and Specialty Property delivered solid results, as we position the company for long-term profitable growth. During the third quarter, we took significant actions to support our strategic realignment and transformation of Assurant. We reached a definitive agreement with Sun Life Financial for the purchase of Assurant Employee Benefits.","The transaction will provide Assurant with $1 billion of net proceeds, including capital releases to support profitable growth long term. Preparations for the divestiture and day one integration are progressing as planned. All required regulatory filings have been submitted and we hope to receive approval to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter 2016.","At Assurant Health, we completed the sale of our supplemental and self-funded businesses to National General on October 1 for $14 million. The challenges at Health increased during the quarter with higher than expected frequency and severity of claims which will require capital infusions in the fourth quarter. While this development is disappointing, the wind down process is on track. We still expect to substantially exit the health insurance market next year and release the remaining capital supporting the business.","The sale of Benefits and wind down of our Health operations, support our strategic focus on specialty, housing and lifestyle markets. We see many opportunities ahead to deliver attractive returns or providing Assurant with greater flexibility to redeploy capital for the benefit of shareholders.","Our enhanced capital management plan announced in September reinforces our confidence in our ongoing businesses as well as our commitment to disciplined deployment over the long term. During the third quarter, we also established an organizational framework that will support our realignment and profitable growth.","The leadership changes announced in September add senior level expertise to our management committee in four critical functions; enterprise risk management, technology, strategy and business development and communication and marketing. These moves set the framework, so that we can be more agile, operate more cost efficiently and accelerate the transformation of Assurant.","I'm especially pleased that Chris will take on the Chief Risk Officer role once the CFO successor is named. Our core risk management capability which Chris developed and championed provides a great foundation from which we will be able to expand our global enterprise risk practices. Our external searches for Chris successor as CFO and for our Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead.","We believe our management committee will benefit from additional outside perspective, especially, given how essential technology and digital transformation are to Assurant's long-term strategy and success in housing and lifestyle. The promotions of Peter Walker and Francesca Luthi also reflect our deep bench of talent at Assurant and underscore the critical importance of strategy and communication and marketing to our ongoing success. These changes will allow our business lines to focus predominantly on critical client relationships, sales, and exceptional customer service.","Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the opportunities at Assurant. During the third quarter, we continued to grow market share, add client partnerships and expand our suite of global offerings. At Assurant Solutions, we launched new mobile protection programs with Google and Samsung. While the programs will start small, these partnerships represent important steps in our global expansion of Connected Living. As a leading provider of vehicle protection services, we also see opportunities to further scale and strengthen our capabilities.","To support our strategy, we acquired Coast To Coast, an auto claims administrator serving more than 1,000 clients across North America. We will leverage their robust administrative platform to extend our market share. Especially Property, we continued to transform our lender-placed platform, which is core to our housing offerings. We're starting to achieve savings that will accelerate and more than offset future investments.","In October, we exited the vehicle title business, which was a non-growth area for us. This business represented less than $10 million of annualized fee income and was sold for $19 million in cash proceeds. This is yet another example of our active and disciplined portfolio management. Momentum in properties targeted growth areas continued in the third quarter.","Multi-family housing again will deliver double-digit growth. We anticipate mortgage solutions will contribute close to $300 million in fee income this year. This represents more than 20% organic growth from 2014. We are pleased with our progress in these areas and believe we are well-positioned for the future.","Now I'll offer some highlights for results year-to-date and then Chris will provide additional details. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 12.5%. As a reminder, this excludes results from Health runoff operations. Assurant's net earned premiums and fees for the nine months of 2015, decreased modestly after adjusting for Health and the sale of American Reliable. This decline reflects the ongoing normalization of lender-placed.","Fee income increased 27% as we broadened our service offerings beyond traditional insurance. Cash flow remains strong, mainly from Specialty Property and Solutions as we ended the quarter with $520 million of holding company capital. For the remainder of this year and into 2016, we will focus on executing our strategy to build a stronger Assurant for the future.","Next year, absent significant hurricane activity, we believe we can sustain results in our ongoing businesses by expanding share in our targeted areas as we manage the normalization of lender-placed and other runoff operations. We will continue to work to eliminate the expense overhang from Health and Employee Benefits. By establishing a more efficient organization model, we will maximize resources in 2016 and beyond. These actions will allow us to realize our aspirations of generating top-quartile shareholder returns.","We're optimistic about the future and encouraged by the pace of progress. And now, I'll turn to Chris, who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions, where results were in line with our expectations. Excluding our $4.5 million net tax benefit from our international operations, segment earnings totaled $48 million for the quarter. This is compared to $55 million in the prior year period after adjusting for a $2.7 million asset impairment charge. The $7 million decline was driven by lower service contract volume at traditional retailers as consumers increasingly prefer e-commerce shopping. Earnings from mobile increased, despite the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program. The improvement was driven by growth in covered devices and sustained client marketing activity.","Revenues at Solutions were down slightly compared to last year. This was due to the tablet program loss, foreign exchange volatility and declines at retailers. The decrease was partially offset by more than 20% growth in the vehicle service contract business from higher production at new and existing clients. Fee income also increased 21%, driven by mobile programs where we continue to expand our repair and logistics offerings.","Looking ahead to 2016, we remain focused on driving sustainable, profitable growth. We believe our integrated Connected Living offerings along with improved international results and expense discipline will be key drivers as we absorb larger declines from retail clients and the runoff of our domestic credit operations.","Now, let's turn to Specialty Property, where results came in stronger than expected. Net operating income declined $17 million to $87 million. This was driven by ongoing lender-placed normalization and client contract changes noted in previous quarters. Overall results, however, benefited from lower catastrophe reinsurance cost, no hurricane activity and lower non-catastrophe losses. Lower frequency and severity trends contributed to the improved loss experience.","We're also encouraged by the increasing contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. Net earned premiums and fees decreased 12% after adjusting for the sale of American Reliable. This was due to declines in lender-placed including the previously disclosed loss of client business. The impact was greater in the third quarter as a higher volume of policies for this client were renewed and transferred to the new carrier.","We expect the transition of these policies to be largely complete by year-end. Specialty Property fee income increased 21% year-over-year. This was primarily due to growth in our property preservation offerings as we added new clients and leveraged cross-selling opportunities.","Turning to expenses, our reported expense ratio increased 520 basis points year-over-year to around 52%. One-third of the increase was due to a greater proportion of fee-based business with the balance primarily caused by lower lender-placed premiums. Excluding mortgage solutions, our insurance expense ratio increased 300 basis points to roughly 45%.","We've made additional investments in our lender-placed platform, and we're able to generate net savings in the third quarter with more efficiency gains expected into 2016. These investments will help to keep our insurance expense ratio in the mid 40%s longer term as we modify the infrastructure to align with the lender-placed declines. We are pleased with Specialty Property's results thus far this year.","In 2016, our focus will be to grow by adding new clients and increasing penetration in mortgage solutions and multi-family housing, while executing our lender-placed transformation. Results at Employee Benefits were in line with expectations, earnings totaled $10 million for the quarter, a slight decline from third quarter 2014, due to less favorable dental and disability results.","Net earned premiums and fee income increased modestly as expected declines in employer-paid products were more than offset by strong voluntary growth. Expansion of voluntary continues to be driven by a diverse product offering and a robust benefits communication and administration platform, which we believe complements Sun Life's existing business.","We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition for brokers, clients, and employees as we prepare to close the sale by the end of the first quarter 2016. As we preannounced last week, Assurant Health runoff operations posted a net loss of $144 million for the third quarter. We experienced higher-than-expected frequency and severity of claims on 2015 ACA individual major medical policies.","Third quarter results also included a strengthening of the premium deficiency reserves to account for higher estimated future losses and other direct expenses through 2017. We incurred $17 million after-tax in severance and other exit-related charges. In order to maintain adequate statutory surplus levels, we will infuse an estimated $200 million into Health in the fourth quarter of this year.","As of January 1, 2016, our block of ACA individual major medical policies will terminate. We expect most claims related to these policies to be paid by the end of the second quarter. In the months ahead, we will continue to refine our estimates for the premium deficiency reserves based on actual loss experience, recoverables under the 2015 ACA risk mitigation program and additional exit-related charges. At the same time, we are evaluating alternative options to limit the length and expenses associated with the wind down period.","As noted in the release, recoverables for 2015 policies under reinsurance and risk adjusted programs totaled $371 million as of September 30, 2015. Consistent with prior quarters, we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk corridors. The majority of reimbursements for 2015 recoverables are expected to be paid in the third quarter of 2016. We will continue to monitor for any updates to that timetable or changes in payment authorization.","Moving to Corporate, we ended September with $270 million of deployable capital. During the third quarter, segment dividends totaled $188 million reflecting solid profitability in our ongoing businesses and capital releases from lender-placed. We made additional investments in our vehicle service contract capabilities and returned $47 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Additionally, in the first three weeks of October, we bought $74 million worth of stock. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 4.2 million shares representing 6% of total shares outstanding. We continue to view the stock as attractively priced.","Over the course of the next 18 months, we will deploy capital prudently through a combination of share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in housing and lifestyle. As always, the timing and pace of our buyback programs take into account a variety of factors. We will continue to monitor claims development at Health and as needed factor that into our decision making.","The corporate loss for the quarter increased to $27 million, primarily reflecting an expected reversal of tax benefits reported in the first half of this year and $2.5 million of strategic repositioning costs. For the full year, the net operating loss for corporate is expected to be around $65 million, excluding repositioning costs.","Our focus for the remainder of 2015 is to position the company for profitable growth. We will do so while successfully managing the upcoming sale of Employee Benefits and continuing the exit of the health insurance market. We believe all of the actions underway are critical to building a stronger company for the future.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now opened for questions. And your first question comes from the line of Mike Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Mike.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Good morning, Mike.","Mike E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. So lots of positive developments with the sale of Benefits and the updated deployment guidance and some strong operating results in the quarter. But once place that we've sort of seen a continued drag is the Health business. And I'm wondering if you could maybe discuss in a little more detail what made you make the changes in this quarter versus really just 90 days ago when you set up the PDR. What are you seeing? Is there sort of third-party data that maybe you got at this point that you didn't have at that?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Appreciate the question. Maybe I'll start, and then Chris, I'll let you go into a little more detail. The challenges in the Health business are an industry challenge as much as an Assurant challenge, and you need to remember \u2013 we all need to remember, this is uncharted territory for the industry. These are polices that were originally priced and designed in the second quarter of 2014 to be sold this year and the market is still evolving and people are still evolving what's happening in the marketplace. I think the results and the variability we've seen kind of reaffirm our decision to exit, and we're very focused on now executing that wind down as best we can. But Chris what would you add on the quarter?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","No. I guess the one thing I would comment on, again, the PDR is a forward-looking measure and so what we saw in the third quarter was higher than expected claims frequency and severity. And in addition to increasing claim reserves for the third quarter activity, we then decided that based upon that activity, we felt it was prudent to increase the PDR to reflect future loss experience and then some additional exit cost. So again, we're not really expecting an improvement in the fourth quarter, but our best estimate as of this point in time is captured in the PDR that we \u2013 the 169 PDR that we've got on for \u2013 at the end of third quarter.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think the last thing I'd say on this, we're now on track as we've said to substantially exit the Health business by the end of 2016.","Mike E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. That's helpful. And then if I could, switching to Solutions, look like a number of new contracts that you've established in the quarter. One place that I guess I still had questions was in the International business \u2013 that's the place that you've sort of continued to run over a 100% combined ratio. I don't believe you call that any one-timers this quarter. Can you kind of discuss what activities you're taking to improve the profitability and what tools you have at your disposal to maybe drive that combined ratio down over time?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We're really focused in Solutions and in Property on adding new growth vectors, new clients extending our offerings, and really living this being more than an insurance company which we are. With that said, FX volatility and some other challenges going on in international, Chris, you might want to comment on that.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. I guess, we continue to believe we can achieve a 95% combined ratio longer term. This year, there's been a few one-offs in the earlier quarters but we continue to move toward that. We're on track there and think longer term we can get to the 95%.","Mike E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Seth.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hey, good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A quick one on Health, can you just update us on where stat capital is at the end of this quarter? I believe it was $340 million as of the midpoint of the year?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, we ended third quarter with around $200 million of statutory capital. Again, that is pre-infusion, the $200 million that we've talked about in the prepared remarks is a fourth quarter level. And again, we continue \u2013 this is our best estimate. Keep in mind the capital infusion is based upon the stat PDR calculation, which is a bit more onerous and thorough with respect to what can be included. So, again, best estimate to the extent that we need to infuse more down the road, we're going to continue to monitor claims activity and make the necessary adjustments.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just I guess on how the stat accounting works, is the theory that whatever stat charge you took should kind of make stat earnings run at a zero level for the next six quarters or should we expect to see a little bit more bleed-through on losses on the stat side?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, the losses that are captured in the stat PDR, stat measure PDR, are more comprehensive on the GAAP side. So, again the $400 million is our best estimate right now. There will be some variability. But again, all of these policies terminate at the end of the year and capital is driven primarily by premiums. So as the business \u2013 as we exit the business, the capital will be released. We expect to get the majority of it back towards the end of 2016 with again the caveat being that we're still monitoring the claims experience in the fourth quarter.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And let me just clarify, Chris, I think you said $400 million, we put \u2013 we're planning to put $200 million additional capital into the fourth quarter, which brings us to a total stat capital of $400 million.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Absolutely. Sorry.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And if I could ask one on the Specialty Property, specifically thinking about the decline in placement rate, which is 30 basis points year-over-year. I understand this lost client portfolio of 600,000 loans from last year had a pretty substantial impact. Could you highlight or segregate out how much of the 30 basis points decline is attributable to that one client portfolio?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","I don't think we've provided that. I mean I think the way I think about it is this was a higher than normal renewal quarter for that particular client, which had a disproportionate contribution to decline in the placement rate quarter-over-quarter. But the one thing you really want to focus on is 1.8 to 2.1 long term, that's where we think this is going. And again, we are \u2013 in years past, we were early and inaccurate predictors of the normalization. We feel like it is well underway now and we're taking the steps to adjust the infrastructure and then reposition our offerings around some of the fee-based business that we've talked about with respect to mortgage solutions.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Mark.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Good morning.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Could you give us some sense on both sides of the business? You've described some very nice puts and takes. Could you give us a sense of where you think sales, the top line should trend in 2016? Just sort of very roughly, are we going to see positive growth in Solutions? Where would you expect the Property to shake out?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we'll \u2013 at the fourth quarter earnings call in February, we'll give an outlook for 2016 that will more specifically address that question. What I would reiterate is something I said in the call remarks, which is that as we think about next year broadly absent cats or significant hurricane activity, we believe we can sustain results in our ongoing businesses really through the combination of growth and market share expansion in Property and Solutions, which offsets the ongoing lender-placed normalization and some of the other runoff operations we have around credit and service contracts.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Is that adjusting for the divestiture of the Benefits business? You sustain results in the Property and Solutions segments?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, in the ongoing businesses, yes. And we'll provide more specifics on how we think about 2016 on that February earnings call for the fourth quarter.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then within Solutions, the shift away from traditional retailers to e-commerce, I think you have mentioned a point about absorbing larger declines from traditional retail. Where do we stand in that shift? How much more do you have to absorb? Obviously, you're offsetting that with new customers. How should we think about that?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's a long process that's been underway for a few years now and we think will continue to play out over the next couple of years. We've been very focused on broadening our distribution to be everywhere the consumer wants to go. And I think as you've seen from some of the announcements of our new partnerships, we feel like the Solutions team is making great progress in doing that, but more to come on the traditional retailers.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sean Dargan with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Sean.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Good morning, Sean.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Just as we look out to the fourth quarter, just wanted to get your initial thoughts on the South Carolina flooding and the hurricane that eventually came through Texas. Are these probably going to be reportable cat events for you?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, I think our best guess at this point is they'll be reportable cat events in the case of the flooding. Flood claims tend to take some time to \u2013 for experience to evolve. So, it takes a little bit longer for us to figure out the full estimate, but we do expect they will be \u2013 both be reportable cat events not certainly necessarily that material but they will affect results in the fourth quarter.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then can you just give us more color on how the fee businesses you're layering in, in Property are going to allow you to keep results probably consistent with 2015. I mean I guess it depends on where one has the placement rate going, but does that imply you're going to need to acquire more fee-based businesses over the next six months or so to be able to keep earnings level?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Sean, let me just make sure I was clear on what I said about 2016, which is when we talk about being able to sustain results, that's for the Assurant ongoing businesses. It's not a specific comment or Property versus Solutions.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We think about it as the overall portfolio of ongoing businesses.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The positive in the fee income is, as we \u2013 I mentioned in the call script, we've had very strong organic growth building off of those selective M&A deals we did in 2013 and 2014 to create the mortgage solutions business. And then as you saw, we did another very small M&A deal in the quarter with Coast To Coast, really a similar thing building additional fee income around our vehicle service contract business. So, good organic growth in our fee income businesses. Probably continue very selective extensions of what we do around these businesses.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, Sean, the other thing I would just \u2013 sorry, just point out there, remember that there is intangible amortization that's going to occur in both Property and Solutions. That's going to be a drag on NOI, but not on cash flow, which is how we're thinking about acquisitions on a go-forward basis.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. And just one follow-up. The type of businesses that you're adding to Property, are they depending on origination levels, both refi and purchase, because if you look at like MBA forecast, total originations are forecasted to get down because if interest rates rise, presumably refi's will crawl to a \u2013 will stop to a crawl at most. So, I'm just wondering how sensitive you are to mortgage origination levels.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, a couple of thoughts on that. If you think about the Property preservation business, that is really not related to that level of origination at all. The appraisal business is somewhat related to the origination activity. But more importantly, we're focused on gaining market share, which we've been doing, as we said 20% plus growth this year really driven by our strong relationships and partnerships with mortgage servicers that allows us to cross-sell these services. And so we feel good about our ability to continue to grow no matter what the external environment is for that business.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the last question comes from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning. I wanted to follow up on Mark Hughes' question about the Solutions and the brick and mortar versus Internet. Maybe we can delve into that a little bit more. I'm really wondering what is the mix shift going on. Is it a shift from some existing retailer that you already have onboard, going \u2013 more of their sales going to Internet, which make sense and you doing not as well on the Internet side as you had done on the bricks and mortar side or is this a case of, I don't know, business going to ipads.com or something like that, somebody that you have no relationship whatsoever?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So a lot of dynamics going on. Really, what's driving all of this is consumer behavior is changing and increasingly consumers are buying digitally, whether that's from a traditional retailer's digital site or whether that's from these new and emerging digital players. What we have been doing, I think, very effectively is Solutions team is building these relationships and partnerships with the digital providers. We've talked in the past about eBay, Google, we mentioned today and there's really a rotation going on from traditional retailers to these digital retailers and we feel well positioned, certainly something when we next have an Investor Day in March, which I'll talk about in a minute, we'll provide a lot more detail on how this business is evolving.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Just one more follow-up on that. Alan, do you \u2013 my assumption would be that you would tend to do worse on sales \u2013 Internet sales, placement if you want to call it that, because there is not a human offering of the product, is that a fair statement?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not necessarily. It varies a lot by retailer and digital retailer. I wouldn't want to generalize like that.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. All right. That's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Nadel, Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, John.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hey, John.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. It's a constant. Good morning. I guess I have a couple of questions. The first one, I wanted to think about the non-cat loss ratio or benefit ratio within Specialty Property. You guys talked about the idea that non-catastrophe weather and even non-weather related claims activity was pretty favorable this quarter, a 35% benefit ratio. I think it seems to be an unsustainable level. There is a lot of moving parts within the segment. I'm wondering if you can give us a better sense for, if activity was more normalized, about what level that 35% should be going forward?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, we think kind of the mid 30%s is sort of the longer term rate, keep in mind a couple of things. So, when you talk about non-cat loss ratio, there is mild weather that contributes to that, which of course is not something we can control, but then, we're seeing nationwide trends around fire, theft and vandalism that are positive. Just keep in mind, however, that longer term lower premium is going to be the bigger driver of that percentage. And so, it will drift higher as the normalization continues.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah. I guess I'm just trying to understand if this was a more normal quarter, whether weather is mild or not, or maybe let's forget about the quarter and think about it over the course of a year, should 35% be more like 38% or 40%? Or \u2013 I'm trying to get a sense for how big the order of magnitude is?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. I mean I think that's fair. I mean clearly, the quarter benefited from a lower non-cat loss ratio, whether it's 3% or 5%, I mean again that's subject to debate, but again, it's the lower premium we're talking about, some of the expense takeouts that we're focused on. But 2015 has absolutely been better than it's been in the past several years.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah. Okay. Then on the Health side, I was hoping you could give us a sense maybe in percentage terms or some way of thinking about the order of magnitude, how much worse in third quarter did actual claims activity get relative to either the second quarter or the first half of the year, that resulted in this pretty significant increase, not only in the actual claims but in the \u2013 your expectations for claims going forward?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, again, so if you think about the total \u2013 the reserve strengthening and the adjustment to the premium reserve deficiency \u2013 deficiency reserve, excuse me, roughly 50-50. I mean, claims were 30% higher in the third quarter, caused us to strengthen (37:19)...","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Is that 30% higher quarter-over-quarter versus Q2?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","That's correct. Yes.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And again, we're \u2013 just as Alan points out, certainly the results were disappointing, but this is unchartered territory. And I think the way we think about it is we have another quarter of claims and then this business moves into \u2013 we'll substantially be out of it. Premiums will drop significantly starting 1\/1 as none of these policies will renew. We'll manage the claims process and the recoverables into the first half of 2016 and then expect to get majority of the statutory capital back over the second half of 2016 into early 2017.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Maybe \u2013 can I ask you and maybe this way, so obviously based on the accruals and assumptions you've got built into the balance sheet at this point for Health and really more thinking about it on the statutory basis, if things played out exactly as you expect, that $400 million inclusive of the infusion you're going to make this quarter, that $400 million will come back or something very close to that $400 million will come back to the parent in late 2016. How much worse would claims activity need to get to exhaust the entirety of that $400 million? Is it another 30% or is it 100% or something? Can you give...","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, I think the way we think about it is certainly there is potential for additional variability, given this is unchartered waters for the industry. We're monitoring it closely. We've assumed that things don't get better from where they are today, will that assumption ultimately be right? There's no way to know. But we are monitoring closely. The other important thing here is that we are honoring all of our obligations to our policyholders as we wind down this business.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","I hear you, Alan. I mean I get that's a very important message. I'm just trying to get a sense for how much buffer that $400 million would provide shareholders against a further capital infusion, if things worsened?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can't really speculate on it. As we've said, there's variability potential here. We've assumed that the claims remain elevated as we look forward.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And then, I know we'll talk more about an outlook for 2016 when you report your fourth quarter earnings in a few months, but can you give us a sense directionally at least thinking about the Corporate operating loss of $65 million, give or take, for 2015, ex some of the sale related costs, how should we think about that trending, because I assume you'll have to absorb some overhead that was formerly allocated to the Benefits and the Health business, but I'd...","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","...also I guess on the other side assume that you'd be doing some cutting?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So maybe \u2013 let me answer that by giving you a little bit of a sense of our broader 2016 priorities, because we're very positive and bullish on how this company is evolving. First thing, we're really focused on as we look to next year is completing this strategic repositioning. That's completing the sale of AEB, which we expect to happen in the first quarter, completing the substantial wind down and exit of Health, and really continuing to expand and grow our positions in housing and lifestyle, where we're very well positioned for taking market share and growing with growing markets.","We are working hard to eliminate the overhang from Health and Employee Benefits. Some of the organizational changes that we announced last month and that allow us to really create a more agile, more efficient organization model. When you put all that together, that's how we're comfortable saying we think we can sustain results absent a cat next year in our ongoing businesses well absorbing the continuing normalization of lender-placed and some of the other runoffs in the retail business.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Understood. And just to clarify, so assuming \u2013 I think another way of saying that is that you'd expect relatively flat earnings, is that \u2013 that is inclusive of corporate or is that just talking about Solutions and Specialty Property?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That I'm talking about the entire Assurant company.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. Okay. And then a real quick, one last one for you. I know it's a little bit backward looking here but your capital position was very strong. You obviously had very \u2013 you had a lot \u2013 you exhibited a lot of confidence even before the announced sale of the Benefits business to Sun Life. You exhibited a lot of confidence in that process. I'm just curious, was there anything specific that held down the buyback in the third quarter, whether it was blackout (42:27) self-imposed related to the Benefits business sale, or just conservatism given it was hurricane season, some way of thinking about that.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Let me start broadly on capital and then I'll ask Chris to comment more specifically. If you think about capital management and deployment, that's been a cornerstone of Assurant's strategy for many years and we've got a very strong track record. As we mentioned we've bought back 6% of the shares year-to-date in 2015. We announced a significant enhancement of our capital management around the timing of the Benefits sale with the increase in the dividend as well as the increase in the buyback authorization. We don't tend to focus as much on quarter-to-quarter as we do think about returning capital over time. But Chris what would you add?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","No, I mean I think and John, we've talked about this before, but again, this is a long-term process. If you look back over our track record the last five or six years, you can see a willingness to return capital to shareholders via share repurchase. We continue to think the stock is attractive. We want to be in the market consistently. Our pattern over the years has been to be a bit conservative heading into cat season. We're now coming out of cat season. We've got better visibility around operating earnings and the availability of those earnings as segment dividends.","We've got the issue with Health and the infusion that's going to require. And then again, we look out in the first quarter, there is going to be a billion of proceeds and release of capital from the sale of Benefits, future operating earnings and then the return of capital from Health as we run the business off and exit by the end of 2016. So, again not quarter-over-quarter, but if you look at the 12-month to 18-month time horizon, you can see ample financial flexibility to execute on our capital management priorities.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah. No, totally understand. Like I said I recognize it was a backward looking question, but it's the most popular question I got last night after you reported.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Okay. It's all right. Thank you.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Seth.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hey, Seth.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for letting me sneak one more in. And maybe just a follow-up on John's question on capital deployment and things forward-looking over the next couple of quarters. You'll get a lot of capital at the end of the first quarter but if we think about the next couple of quarters and potentially some limits on capital return, how would you think about that $250 million risk buffer that you set up or that you refer to, given that we'll get a good deal of capital in the first quarter and that there's now going to be a higher infusion of capital and Health, which should help manage at least some of the earnings volatility in the next couple of quarters?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. So I mean, I think really we're talking about a timing issue and again we kind of talked about this time horizon 12 months to 18 months through the first quarter of 2017 basically and holistically how you think about inflows and outflows. In terms of the fourth quarter, again, we've talked about the Health infusion of $200 million. We've got some earnings from the operating segments that are going to come up. We tend to backend load our operating segment dividends. We've done that many, many years and feel pretty good about what we see in the fourth quarter.","It's been a fairly light cat season, although we will have some cat losses in the fourth quarter to address. But really when I think about it \u2013 I don't want to think about it one quarter versus the next, but just more broadly over a \u2013 again in this case 12 months to 18 months with good line of sight on some substantial capital inflows.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. But fair to say that you intend to at least maintain that $250 million buffer next quarter?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Again, when I \u2013 I put on my CRO hat now a little bit early, but I think that was a byproduct of some work we did in the early phases of our enterprises management initiative. We continue to evaluate it, but at this point feel it's still the right number for us on a go-forward basis.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And your last question comes from Mark Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Hello. The recoverables in the Health business, I think you'd mentioned $370 million, was that right, the risk-corridor and the reinsurance recoverables?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","The...","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","...risk adjuster and the reinsurance recoverable, Mark, so rough \u2013 it's $160 million or so risk adjuster for 2015 and about $210 million for the reinsurance recoverable.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we had no net risk corridor on our books.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. And so you \u2013 assuming everything works out, you get your $200 million stat capital back, the extra $200 billion putting in 4Q and then those other recoverable, those should show up roughly 3Q, that's all additional cash that's available for other purposes, is that right?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, well, there's cash and the return of capital. So, I think when you think about how much capital we're going to get back out of the business, it's bounded by the $400 million currently with any future adjustments to be made as claims emerge.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. But then you pull that essentially working capital out of the business as well in the form of these recoverables, is that right?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Those are offsets to claims we've already paid, so it will not \u2013 that's not money that'll come back up to the holding company.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Where does that cash sit once you recover it?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","These are against paid claims.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. Sits within the Health segment.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. Okay. And then the Health business, did you send out cancellation notices to consumers? Did that spark some additional flurry of utilization? And if so, what was the timing on that? Has that stabilized?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So we did announce to our insurers that we were exiting the Health business. We're looking at the contributing factors, I mean again, it's \u2013 in terms of what cause the increasing claims activity, there's a seasonality element that always comes into play towards this, in the second half, but again back to the PDR, is our best estimate factoring in, the information we have available now and our best estimate of the loss experience and expenses going forward.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other thing I'd add just quickly is if you look at the industry data we have which has lagged, so it's not up to date, it lags a few months. The industry is experiencing higher elevated claims as well, so we can't completely parse apart everything in it, but it's an industry wide issue as well.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And when would you have notified the insureds?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We started all around early June after our announcement.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then I may need to go back to accounting 101, but on the recoverables you've already paid the claims. You've got certain recoverable. Once you get paid, is that not cash in your pocket or am I thinking about that the wrong way?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, that's correct.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. So it is incremental cash that you'll receive, the $360 million, $370 million or so will be cash that you could then use for other purposes. It won't be earnings, but it will be cash that you'll receive?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, it's cash that's been paid out that we're then going to get money back on. We'll have paid that out over the course of the 2015 cohort claims experience.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Exactly. And then the cash will be coming back to you, so to speak, or you'll be refunded on that particular amount, so that cash will then be available for other purposes?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","That's correct. We have a recoverable on the books that will become cash.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. So you will be winding down that working capital, so to speak. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Well, thanks everyone for participating in today's call.

(Operator Instructions).","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi","Thank you Quint and good morning everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2012 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant\u2019s conference call are Rob Pollock, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Peninger, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday afternoon we issued a news release announcing our third quarter results. Both the release and corresponding financial supplemental are available at Assurant.com. As a reminder, all prior period financial information presented in the release, financial supplement and on this call reflects the new accounting guidelines for deferred acquisition costs, which the company adopted as of January 1, 2012.","We\u2019ll start today\u2019s call with brief remarks from Rob and Mike, with Chris participating in the Q&A session.","As a reminder, some of the statements we make on today\u2019s call may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday\u2019s new release, as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2011 Form 10-K, second quarter 2012 Form 10-Q and the upcoming third quarter Form 10-Q available at Assurant.com.","Today\u2019s call will also contain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company\u2019s performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted on Assurant.com.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Rob.","Rob Pollock","Good morning everyone and thanks Francesca. We are pleased to have you on the Assurant team and appreciate the seamless transitions you provided investors, because of the broad experience you bring to the job.","I also want to congratulate and thank Melissa Kivett as she moves to her new role as Senior Vice President, Business Development and Strategy. This is an excellent example of how we develop the leadership team at Assurant.","Our results for the third quarter of 2012 were strong and in line with our expectations. We are pleased with our continued progress in executing our strategy as we gain traction in the areas we have targeted for profitable growth. We are committed to creating long term value for shareholders and our capital management strategy is a key driver. ","For the first nine months of 2012, we\u2019ve returned approximately $420 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and we did this while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","Let me outline our performance against the three key operating metrics we used to track our progress. First, we reported an annualized operating return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI of 11.8% for the quarter. Year-to-date, annualized operating return on equity is 13.6%. This includes $20 million of income from real estate joint ventures and $28 million from reportable catastrophe losses.","Second, book value per diluted share excluding AOCI grew by 4% in the quarter and by 13% year-to-date. Solid earnings and continued share repurchases drove the increase.","Third, revenue defined as net earned premiums and fee income grew by 4% to $2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2011, with solutions in specialty property leading the increase. Year-to-date revenue increased by about 3% compared to last year.","In 2012 our focus has been on achieving profitable growth and we are making solid progress, but the macro environment is challenging. Unemployment remains alleviated, interest rates are at record lows and regulatory changes pervasive throughout the financial services sector in general and the insurance industry in particular.","Now, let me comment on the businesses and the key trends influencing our results. In Assurant Solutions, both revenue and net operating income increased in the quarter compared to 2011. Improved performance in our domestic service contract business and across our Latin American operations, including mobile, were the primary contributors.","As sales have begun to rebound in the U.S. automotive sector, our vehicle service contract business is gaining renewed momentum. In addition, the continued growth and the use of mobile devices has expanded the market opportunity for our products worldwide. ","Our pre-need business continues to perform well as we work closely with the industry leader SCI. As we look ahead, we are focused on achieving a 14% ROE in solutions in 2014. This will require a continued organizational focus on our strategic growth areas and reduced resources on nine growth areas. ","Turning to Assurant Specialty Property, our track record of great client service continues to generate success. We expanded our lender place business with new and existing clients. In the third quarter we signed a contract with a new client for a portfolio of 1 million loans, with expected placement rates around 1%. We expect to earn premiums on this business after the loans are on boarded in the first quarter of 2013.","Including this win, our total loans tracked are up more than 7% since 2010. We\u2019ve benefited in recent years from loan movements towards the specialty services. We won portfolios and competitive bidding. Placement rates have remained at alleviated levels instead of declining. The timing of the housing recovery is difficult to predict, but we do believe that when the business normalizes, we will continue to have an attractive lender place specialty business, albeit with lower capital requirements and earnings. ","We continue to grow our multi family housing business, comprised mainly of renters insurance and resident bond products. Together they have grown to over $145 million of annualized revenue and we believe they have the potential to deliver double-digit revenue growth for the next several years.","After Mike reviews the financial highlights for the quarter, I\u2019ll offer an update on various actions underway in our lender place business, including the recent California rate reduction. ","Assurant\u2019s Health\u2019s third quarter performance reflects continued success in 2012, in reducing expenses and tailoring our product offerings to consumer preferences for affordability and choice. We are encouraged by the growing interest in our Assurant health access and supplemental coverages products as Americans look for affordable alternatives. ","Our network agreement with Aetna further improves the affordability of the individual major medical products and offers a broader choice of network providers. Health will face additional challenges as the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act continues to unfold. ","With the health exchanges beginning to take shape for 2014, we will need to further adapt our business model in what will be an evolving and likely quite different individual medical insurance marketplace than we have seen before. While we look to address these near term challenges, we remain confident in the long-term prospects of our business until the healthcare market opportunity expands. ","Assurant\u2019s employee benefit continues to navigate through a challenging environment, characterized by low interest rates and continued economic uncertainty among small businesses. Voluntary products remain our growth engine in employee benefits and accounted for nearly half of new sales and more than a third of earned premiums in the quarter. These results demonstrate the success of our distribution approach that emphasizes key brokers, as well as our expanded voluntary offerings and capabilities. Overall I am pleased with our progress this year.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it to Mike for more detailed comments on the third quarter.","Mike Peninger","Thanks Rob. I\u2019ll discuss a few highlights from the quarter and key priorities for each of our businesses, starting with Assurant Solutions. ","During the third quarter, Solutions delivered double digit growth in net earned premiums and fees, driven by our domestic service contract and Latin American business. Growth in Latin America was primarily generated from service contracts sold through mobile and retail clients. ","As a reminder, net earned premiums in the fourth quarter will reflect the previously disclosed loss of a domestic mobile client effective October 1, which accounted for about $100 million of annual earned premiums.","Solutions also generated strong sales, particularly in our domestic service contracts from both retail and automotive clients. In the third quarter we assumed a block of automotive warranty business, which added about $40 million to growth written premiums. This block, along with improved auto sales over the past year, has led to strong growth in our vehicle service contract business.","Solutions new business pipeline remains strong, particularly in the mobile segment. Our previously announced wins, both domestically and abroad, demonstrate our ability to compete in the fast growing mobile market place.","The international combined ratio decreased to about 102%, excluding a charge related to our recent tax court decision, impacting certain products sold by insurance companies in Germany. The improvement was driven by more favorable results in Europe and Latin America. For the full year we expect the international combined ratio to be near our target of 102% excluding disclosed items. ","Solutions remains focused on its goals of breaking even in the U.K. by mid 2013 and achieving an overall return on Equity of 14% in 2014. While we expect growth across the business, we will need expense reductions to achieve these targets, particularly in areas experiencing market pressures such as Europe and the domestic credit business. ","Specialty property posted strong results in the third quarter, reflecting revenue growth in lender placed homeowners insurance and multi family housing products. Catastrophe losses were lower compared to the same period last year. Placement rates remained alleviated compared to historic averages, reflecting the continued impact of seriously delinquent loans. ","We did however see a 10 basis point sequential decline in the third quarter. This was driven in part by the 2.1 million loans we added last quarter, which has about a 1% placement rate, but it maybe further evidence of seriously delinquent loans moving to resolution. We anticipate that placement rates will continue to decline at a pace, which largely depends on the state of the economy, housing policy and client specific portfolio characteristics. ","For 2013 we expect lender placed premiums and returns to be lower, primarily reflecting a continued reduction in placement rates and lower premiums, including the impact of the California rate reduction. This will be partially offset by the recent growth and the number of loans we track. We intend to mitigate the impact of lower premiums and higher combined ratios by managing expenses and freeing up capital as the business moves to a normalized steady state over the next few years.","At Health, net operating income increased due to continued expense management and favorable loss experience. The higher effective tax rate in the quarter reflects healthcare reform restrictions on deductible expenses. ","Revenue declined due to ongoing product mix shifts and challenging economic conditions, particularly in our small group business. Our target market and group in the Health\u2019s group business is employers with less than 10 employees. We are seeing fewer business of that size adding employees or looking for coverage.","In the quarter, Health continued to tightly manage expenses. We will continue to look for additional expense savings opportunities over the course of the next year, but they are likely to come at a slower pace. ","Looking forward we expect our loss ratio to increase as we continue to adjust our pricing to reflect minimum loss ratio targets. We also expect continued weak sales in our small group segment, as employers grapple with understanding and the full impact of healthcare reform. These trends combined with the expenditures required to prepare for 2014 requirements, will lead to a decline in Health\u2019s earnings next year. ","Despite the near term hurdles, we are focused on generating sales, driving further expense savings and managing capital efficiently, as we position our Health business for long term success under healthcare reform.","At employee benefits, net operating income declined by about 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting slightly higher disability loss experience, which can often by volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Overall disability incidence rates remain stable and dental experience was excellent consistent with recent trends.","Looking ahead, persistent high unemployment, low payroll growth and lower interest rates continue to present challenges that we will have to navigate. However, our broad product suite and robust administrative and enrollment tools make our voluntary products attractive options for businesses with less than 500 employees.","Moving to corporate matters, our capital position remains strong. We ended the quarter with approximately $370 million of deployable capital, in addition to our $250 million buffer. Share repurchases totaled $110 million in the quarter, compared to $76 million in the same period last year. ","We anticipate that full year operating company dividends will at least equal operating earnings. We continue to believe our share price is attractive and expect to continue our repurchase activity during the remainder of the fourth quarter, subject as always to market conditions.","Despite persistently low interest rates, our investment portfolio continued to perform well. Our conservative investment philosophy and low asset turnover helped to moderate the pace of the yield decline in our portfolio.","In line with our accounting policy, we will perform our annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter. While we hold our goodwill in the corporate segment, testing is done at the business segment level. We will carefully consider the impact of the economic environment on each business and will report the results of our goodwill testing on our fourth quarter call. ","Overall we are pleased with our third quarter results and progress in creating long-term value for our shareholders.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Rob.","Rob Pollock","Thanks Mike. Now I want to update you on what has transpired in our lender placed business since our last call; I\u2019ll start with California. ","In 2012 we expect to record approximately $108 million of net earned premiums for policies subject to the rate reduction, compared to $124 million earned in 2011. The agreement we reached to reduce rates by about 30% reflects continued favorable loss experience since we first filed for a decrease nearly two years ago. It also uses different assumptions about future experience than we used in our previous filings. ","These rates will be implemented on new policies beginning sometime in January and on policies that renew after that date as well. The estimated impact of the rate reduction on net earned premiums and net operating income will be about $33 million and $18 million respectively on an annual basis. Let me provide some background on these estimates. ","They assume that our block of business and placement rates in California remain at current levels in the future. For context, California placement rates are down this year compared to 2011. The ultimate impact from the reduction will depend on future placement rates and many other factors such as lapse rates, when policies renew and average insured values of homes. ","I should also point out we are pursuing operating improvements, which have not been considered in the net operating income impact provided. Its important to remember that the rate setting approval process varies in each State. Regulations and rating variables such as coastal and catastrophe exposure, loss experience, prospective claim class trends and the availability of insurance coverage are State specific. That is why our state-by-state outreach is critical. ","We regularly engage in discussions with the different insurance department. Right now these discussions are centered on how to best implement our next generation product. For example, in Florida we are in discussions with the insurance department and are preparing to file our new product in the fourth quarter. ","It further continues to be our largest state and also bears a large proportion of our catastrophe exposure. Therefore to fully understand our business there, it\u2019s important to consider net earned premiums before the cost of catastrophe reinsurance. In the first nine months of the year, this amount totaled about $270 million.","We\u2019ve begun to implement our next generation lender priced product in 14 other states where its been approved. We plan to follow a multi phased roll out that will continue throughout the next year. ","In New York, we continue to be in dialogue with the department of financial services, but do not have any further updates at this time. At the federal level, the federal housing finance agency have stepped efforts to get input from the mortgage servicers and align the views of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We supported our servicer clients with information, as they have provided input to this agency. ","The consumer financial protection bureau proposed mortgage service or guidelines issued in August. The guidelines largely reflect many of our current lender place practices. We expect them to announce their final rules in January 2013. ","And with that, we can move into the Q&A portion of our call. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question from the side of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners. Go ahead, your line is open. ","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Good morning. Actually I just want to go back firstly to the last comment that you made Rob. I think you said Florida premium was $270 million before the CAT load. How much is it with kind of fully baked? ","Rob Pollock","So what we are trying to provide Mark is a way to think about the premium subject to our rating action, okay. And so what we did is outline the earned premium plus the reinsurance premiums related to CAT exposures in the state of Florida.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Okay. I just think that, just knowing how important Florida is, and most people having estimates that are I guess meaningful higher than that would imply, I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for whether the book is 25% in total fully loaded, 30%, 35%, 40%.","Mike Peninger","That\u2019s a nine-month number mark. So if you annualize it, that maybe helps.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Okay, moving on. I guess you talked a lot about capital release in specialty property and I\u2019m trying to get a handle around how to think about that. On the one hand you have placement rates that are clearly going to go down over time and therefore your exposures go down. At the same you also have likely rate compression that arguably affects the ability to kind of cross fund looses. So how should we think about capital release as both of those factors work together? ","Rob Pollock","I mean, so lets start with our capitalization for the business, for all our businesses. Start with the BCAR models, okay and those models are what we use to maintain ratings, which are quite important to our clients. ","All of our ratings are at the A-minus or higher level. And so when you look at those formulas as they relate to the statutory entities where we write this business, the capital requirement is in the mid-40% of premium level. That\u2019s a simplification, because there\u2019s a lot of factors that work into that Mark, but that\u2019s just a way to think about things. ","Clearly we agree that as the business moves towards a steady state, we are going to earn a little bit less money, but the returns will be still be attractive and we are going to be in a position to still have and attractive specifically business when we return to more normal levels. ","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners"," ","But I guess, may be I\u2019ll ask it a little more simplistically, which is as placement rates go down, should we in just knowing that there are rate pressures, would we assume that the ability to leverage the business is actually not as favorable because of the rate actions or is it more in line with how placement rates should go down. ","Mike Peninger","If I\u2019m understating the question, I think it\u2019s more in line. So again, you got to think about the process of capital requirements and what they are function of, okay. I don\u2019t know, a little bit less we\u2019ll get some, but not all the same kind of expense efficiencies, because some of the costs are related to that tracking system, which in the near term are pretty fixed. ","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Okay, and then just on expenses, when you talked abut as the business declines cutting expenses etcetera, so I\u2019m trying to get a sense for how to think about that as well. Because again, you have the total platform of specialty property declining fairly meaningfully, given where placement rates are, etcetera, and the question is, can you actually scale down the operating expenses, not the variable senses, but the fixed costs in line with how premium goes down or would you end up with negative leverage? ","Rob Pollock","Okay, so a couple of different points; number one, the reason we have been so successfully in this business is our customer service, which we are not going to cut back on that. In fact, I\u2019d say many of servicing clients are asking for more services from us and we are able to provide them. So we are not going to give up on anything that might impact the customer. ","We\u2019ve had quite a bit of growth in the business. We\u2019ve talked about placement rates going down for several years; they in fact have gone up. They are still at elevated levels. We don\u2019t know what that actual steady state level is, but we\u2019ve compared back to 2006 okay, and we said that we believe that\u2019s probably where things will return when the mortgage market recovers. ","Now we\u2019ve had a lot of growth. Gene and this team are always working on operational improvements. We will find ways to reduce expenses. In the near term there are some of the expenses that are more fixed. We can look at those too, but I\u2019d keep that first point I made in mind here; the customer service is a big part of what delivers our value proposition to the servicer and we don\u2019t what to give up on those things. ","So we will work our way to finding out how we can get to lower expense. Right now remember, we are still acquiring loans. Our loan portfolio is growing and placement rates are at higher levels. So we\u2019ve got to deal with the business as it exists today.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Okay. All right, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the side of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, your line is open.","","Rob Pollock ","Good morning Chris.","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Thanks so much. A follow up for Mark\u2019s question on the expense side and Rob you mentioned kind of \u201906 and if we go back to that timeframe, the administrative expenses were running around $550 million. Today we are close to on an annual basis of $825 million. So if we think about that as a steady state for our revenue side, should we be thinking about the same level kind of expenses or is some of the customer service initiatives you guys are implementing going to maybe drive up that number a bit higher. ","Rob Pollock","First, that\u2019s an interesting way to look at it. I can\u2019t speak all the numbers right away, but I will tell you, a couple of things that are important to think about Chris are we have a mix of business shift going on. We mentioned our renters business and multifamily housing product businesses growing. That has a different expense structure associated with it than the lender-placed business does. ","When you look at premiums, premiums that are generated have some variable components. Those expenses will go away as premiums do and we are working efficiencies in the business and we hope to re-close as well. ","So again, I think what we need to do is allow a number of things to settle out there. We\u2019ll be in a position to provide you an update on our belief on where things will be, we just don\u2019t have that right now, because again, we are adding new business and the market is growing for us right now. ","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Okay, understood. And then you would mention the 14 States that you\u2019ve seeped and got an approval for kind of on the next gen product. So can you maybe talk about the differences in price and maybe the terms and conditions of the new policy versus the previous policy. And then roughly if you do have, what percentage of maybe premiums these 14 sates represent.","Rob Pollock","Yes, well there\u2019s a couple of different things. So again, as we talked about this net generation product, the features that go along with that, they are not rocket scientist type variables. We are going to do a little more expansion of geo rating. We are going to have more options on deductibles, we can deal with different blocks of loans differently, that\u2019s not where the work is. ","The work is being in a position to service programs for each of the mortgage servicers differently. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time and effort in our system area to make sure our systems can accommodate that, and so that\u2019s why we are very focused on the implementation, because that\u2019s the most important things. ","Now, in terms of trying to figure out how any of this is going to work, it\u2019s way too early. We just are starting this process in a few states and it\u2019s going to be dependent on who the particular policyholders are and their characteristics. But we have our line of sight on that; we\u2019ll provide the information. ","Mike Peninger","Yes, I think Chris, just in the initial rollout or something that\u2019s reasonably different, we would naturally I think start with our smaller states and so the 14 that we are working on now tend to be on the smaller side, plus its going to take some time to actually roll out and go through the letter cycle and all the other things that go along with the policies. So that\u2019s another reason its difficult to give you an estimate of the premium impact now. ","I\u2019d also say, Rob mentioned the flexibility. I think that is a pretty important point, because our servicers then can have more choices in how they administer their own programs, which means the impact on us will be somewhat dependant on our client decisions too. ","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Okay, and then with the implementation of that, I mean I guess based on the loss time that the answer would be no. But will the implementation will be similar to California where all new and existing business will go in this next gen product or would people still be staying in the existing LPI products? ","Rob Pollock","So they will go to the new for all new business and as business renews, it will move to the new product as well. ","","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Okay, very helpful and just lastly, on capital, I mean obviously you mentioned you are going to continue to be in the market, but obviously there are some headwinds for some of the business as you go forward. So I guess as you think about acquisitions, especially business lines, along with kind of incremental debt capacity here, how are you balancing buybacks versus M&A.","Rob Pollock","Yes, well I think first I\u2019m going to take one step back and say I think we\u2019ve identified targeted areas and each of the business for growth and whether that\u2019s multifamily housing in the property business, the voluntary business in benefits, affordable choice medical products in Health, the mobile and international business and solutions, particularly in Latin America, those are places that we are more likely to look for organic growth, as well things that could help us on the M&A side, okay, so we are looking at those. ","I\u2019m going to switch over and let Chris talk a little about it. Okay, so we are looking at all that, how do we evaluate M&A opportunities versus buyback. I think the methodology is still quite consistent and Chris you want to just elaborate on that a little. ","Chris Pagano "," ","Sure, hi Chris. I don\u2019t think anything is changed in the way we are looking at profitable growth opportunities. I think our capital priorities are the same, capitalize the operating companies and then look to deploy capital either organically or through M&A using what is a significant amount of deployable capital currently at the holding company. ","And then to the extent that there are opportunities in the near term, we have been very disciplined about returning the capital to shareholders. Most of the return of capital in the last three years has been via share repurchase, and we continue to think that will play a role, given where we think, how attractive we think the share price is right now. ","But ultimately it\u2019s about maintaining flexibility and that\u2019s where your comment around debt capacity comes in. We do think that give that our debt to total cap is just over 18%, we do have the ability to go to the market for probably $300 million to$350 million of opportunistic debt. We also have the 2014 issue that matures in February, which we realistically need to address sometime between now and the end of 2013. ","But again the main source of capital is going to be what we have at the holding company now, which is about $370 million and then being able to access operating earnings in the form of dividend gives us a lot of options with regards both M&A and share repurchase. ","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the side of Jeff Schuman with KBW. Go ahead, your line is open. ","Rob Pollock ","","Good morning Jeff.","Mike Peninger","Hi Jeff.","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","Good morning, how are you? ","Rob Pollock","Good.","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","I was just wondering, first of call very basic question about the lender placed. How does it renew it? Does it typically renew it annually or how is it renew? ","Rob Pollock","Yes, it\u2019s typically annual. ","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","Okay. And then in California as you talked to them about the rate decrease, I mean did you also talk to them about any aspects of the next gen product. Is there going to be more geographic reading or any other changes? ","Rob Pollock","I think our hope is to now sit down and talk to them. We\u2019ve certainly mentioned the issue. So I think we are now positioned to move toward that product and we hope to do that as quickly as we can make that happen. ","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","And also as part of those discussions, were there any agreements about captive reinsurance or commission practices. ","Rob Pollock","Not that.","Mike Peninger","I don\u2019t think so, Jeff. I think these are primarily around the pricing of the product. ","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","Okay and then lastly, I think coming out of the NAIC hearings I think it\u2019s a kind of thing that there\u2019s some other state might be more actively looking at rates. Did you talk about the fact that you do have ongoing discussions, but are there any other particular states outside of California, Florida and New York that are maybe a little more active than they have been in pursuing the rate issues. ","Rob Pollock","None that come to mind. Again, the process on this is we have a dialog regularly that process on how the state goes through and reviews things as different. I will say that we are engaged in dialog with all of them, because we are focused on getting this next generation product up and activated in all the states. ","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","Okay, that\u2019s it from me. Thank you. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the site of John Nadel with Sterne, Agee. Go ahead, your lines open.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach ","Good morning Rob, good morning Mike. I was hopping we might be able to take a slightly different approach to thinking about steady states for the lender place business. ","About 18 months ago at your Investor Day you laid out a view of how this business might be impacted as the housing market yields and placement rates drop and I think that essentially suggested that the specialty property segment would see revenues down to $1.5 billion, combined ratios would rise, placement rates would fall and it seems to suggest doing all the math, about $180 million to $200 million of earnings from this segment, once you got to that steady state, whenever that was. ","So my question for you is this, as we think about it 18 months later, with a lot of the things that are changing, rate pressure, CFPB, proposed changes that might take placement rates lower, all that sort of stuff, growth in the business maybe as a slight off set, can you give us some help in just understanding order of magnitude; how some of those assumptions that you\u2019ve previous laid out for us might change? ","Rob Pollock","Well, first we thought that placement rates were going to start coming down. They actually went the other way John. So again, I think that\u2019s a function of the broader housing market. Pretty difficult for us to predict giving all the variables going on, right. ","A lot of that has evolved, a lot of it has lead to the development of this new product that can be more flexible and more responsive to today\u2019s housing market and we embarked on that process starting in late \u201810 and as I mentioned, its not that the product filing per say is so complicated; its all about do we have the administrative system set up to deal with things on a servicer by servicer basis, dealing with all the different things that have been raised by the GSCs, different things that servicers might want and we are really proud that we have a system that can actually deal with all these things, okay. ","So we are going to provide and the market is clearly evolved in a way we couldn\u2019t have imagined. But when we get through a few more of these things, because I think we are getting the resolution, close to resolution on the number of them, we will put together an update re-forecast of what we now see the steady state being moving forward, but we just don\u2019t have it right now, because a number of the variables I think\u2026","Mike Peninger","It evolves in motion.","Rob Pollock","They are just all in motion, exactly. ","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","All right. I mean listen, I understand there is a lot going on. I think that commitment to sort of update everybody I think is really important, because this is clearly just a very important issue for the shareholders to think about. ","I just have a question for you on the capital in specialty property and maybe it\u2019s a bit along the lines of Mark\u2019s question and I understand how the BCAR, the best capital ration or model works. But should we expect, if premiums drop because of a rate reduction, versus premiums dropping because of placement rate falls, should we expect the same sort of level of capital release from the business under either of those scenarios. In the first case your exposures don\u2019t change, but in the second they clearly do. ","Rob Pollock","Yes, you are on an interesting point. But I guess I\u2019d say two things John, right. The formulas themselves are somewhat mechanically, that did apply and of course then they look at an applied judgment to a broader set of issues. So could it conceivably be different, it could. ","When I look at all this stuff though, if you look at our business placement rate change, which we said for a long time is going to be the biggest driver on what happens to the business we believe. ","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Yes, I agree too, yes","Rob Pollock","And so, that\u2019s where we are focused and we are very focused on having a product that can meet what is clearly a different market place today than when we had three or four years ago. ","Mike Peninger","And I\u2019d also just say, we have very regular dialogue with A. M. Best and they have a very thorough understanding of our business John and also they make their own decisions, but its not and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be talking with them as things go forward. ","Chris Pagano ","Yes John, it\u2019s Chris. Maybe one other comment, and I think Mark was touching on this earlier. Capital is going to be going forward about risk and the smaller the block, the lower the placement rate, which is our expectation, the lower the risk. ","Now the rules of thumb that we\u2019ve given you in the past may change and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll address with regard to our discussions with the rating agencies. Keep in mind it also has to do with the amount of catastrophe reinsurance that we buy, which is a critical piece of our risk management. But untimely and I think our updated view around steady state and can also include an updated view around capital and what the lender placed product\u2019s going to represent going forward. ","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, thanks I just have a couple of more quick ones, I\u2019m sorry. Is there a way to help us understand, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re going to be filing your next generation products in Florida next month and I don\u2019t know if this is going to be easy or not, but is there a way to help us understand sort of on an apples-to-apples basis what the premium rate will look like on the next gen product versus what you\u2019ve already got in place. ","Rob Pollock","Well, I think it\u2019s just a couple of things to think about there John. I think the most important things is we will provide an update when we know we\u2019ve reached the resolution with the state, that\u2019s kind of number one. ","Number two is, I look at that next generation product and if you think about all the things that product is looking to address, I can\u2019t think of a state that has all of them operating, more than Florida does, okay. So it is going to be the perfect test case for how all these flexible variables could be put in to play. But they are going to be put in play by the servicer, okay. So that again, the complexity of trying to estimate what is going to happen I think is really difficult, but when we know something we will report it out. ","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, and then the last two quick ones. Are you seeing seated premiums to your lenders or servicer partners decline yet? ","Rob Pollock","Each of the services that have reinsurance sort of make their own decisions. We did have a client this quarter that made a change in their program John, you probably saw that in our numbers but that\u2019s something that\u2019s sort of client specific issue. ","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay and then are commissions being cut yet? ","Rob Pollock","Again, if you think about the way we talked about this, this will be a servicer specific issue on how they want things to work. So I don\u2019t know that I can say that John, but when we know we\u2019ll \u2013 this is another one that each client \u2013 each client makers their own decisions, yes.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, thank you very much. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the side of Sean Dargan with Macquarie. Go ahead, your line is open. ","Rob Pollock","Good morning Sean. ","Mike Peninger","Good morning Sean.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research Equities","Good morning, thank you. I was just wondering if you can maybe tell us about the experience you are seeing in placement rates in different sates. There are different foreclosure processes and different hoops that one will just have to jump through. Would it be safe to say that you see placement rates coming down more in California than say Florida? ","Rob Pollock","I haven\u2019t looked at the Florida experience, so I can\u2019t really make a statement on that. But I think the issue you outlined is an important one. If you think about issues like the economy in the area, like how does the process work to move a property foreclosure, these are all things that will have impact on the placement rates. ","In addition how many loans are seriously delinquent is going to be a driver there too. So every State really is different depending on those factors and they will untimely play out based on all those different conditions. ","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research Equities","Thanks. If I can just shift to Assurant Health, I think you mentioned that you expect premiums and earnings to come down in 2013. Can you give us any sensitivity or the degree to which it will come down? ","Rob Pollock","Well, in the MLR requirement, there\u2019s the big thing that we have to sort of adjust our pricing to over time Sean. If you look at our loss ratios, they are in the low 70s. I think we have said before that you can\u2019t compare an MLR loss ratio calculation and a gap loss ratio directly, because there\u2019s different rules for the MLR calculation. And then you\u2019ve got to think about the mix of our products that are subject to the MLR and some aren\u2019t, so you\u2019ve got a variety of factors going. ","But I think its fair to say that our loss ratios will be rising as we adjust the pricing and it takes time for our rate changes, just like when you need to increase prices, it takes tame to roll increases through your block when you\u2019re changing in the other direction; it takes time for that roll through. So over time that\u2019s going to start impacting our loss ratio, so you will see those rising. ","Then you\u2019ve got the other sort loss study factory is that we\u2019ve got a lot of growth going on in our health access and supplemental products. We\u2019ve also got our Aetna arrangement that is helping with the sales of our more traditional individual major medical products. ","So you\u2019ve got a lot of different things and then as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, you\u2019ve got this sort of freeze in the small group markets. So you\u2019ve got a lot of different factors there, but I think the primary thing that leads us to say earnings will go down is that loss ratios will go higher. ","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research Equities","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the side of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Go ahead, your line is open.","Rob Pollock","Good morning Stephen."," ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Hey, good morning everybody. I have a few, I apologize ahead of time. Mark mentioned the 270 in Florida. I guess that annualizes to 360 or whatever it is. Is the importance of that number that any rate cut that occurs, the reinsurers aren\u2019t going to take it, the CAT re-guys aren\u2019t going to take back their exposure. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens to your rates. Is that\u2026","Rob Pollock","That\u2019s why we try to present it that way. ","Mike Peninger","Yes exactly.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay good, just makings sure. Sticking with that, you\u2019ve got this new client 1 million loans, just so I\u2019m clear here, once that\u2019s on your books, you will get the policies currently in force right. This isn\u2019t one of these deals where it rolls over time. ","Rob Pollock","So in Athens we are going to get the new business that is written, but we will not get the end; its not a flat cancel called. ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Its not a not a flat cancel, that was the term I was looking for. Okay, not a flat cancel, quite an asset. And then going back on to the discussion of the next gen product, I guess the choppiness is what we are all dealing with here. I\u2019m going to make up a number. Lets say you have a 75-combined ratio in a State and the regulators for political reasons or whatever are saying that\u2019s too low, all right. Introducing the next gen product, is it going to make a 75 combined okay, right. ","Rob Pollock","Again, I think we are talking about apples-and-oranges here a little bit Steven. Lets first talk about what that next generation product does; it allows lots of flexibility. For instance lets take an example. You could vary the deductible offered based on the value of the home. Right now, decisions tend to be made uniformly for a portfolio. While that\u2019s a big difference and has the ability to change rates if you are at a, lets say a $2000 deductible versus a $200 deductible, so those kinds of things could make a big difference. ","Second, if we look at just \u2013 we are going to put in some difference is geographic rating. So, that\u2019s says to me if you are closer to cost line, those rates maybe going up a little bit but the other side of that is people away are going to pay less. So we don\u2019t do any underwriting that has to be recognized and presented. The historical look is obviously one place they look, but the more interesting I think the thing that we have to talk about is what is our exposure and what do we think costs are going to be prospectively. ","So lot of this really relates to \u2013 and your seeing it just looking at the reinsurer models. People think the cost of catastrophe\u2019s are going up. That\u2019s difficult when in the last year for instance we didn\u2019t have many and that\u2019s where a lot of the dialogue needs to take place in my mind with actuary to actuary, looking at the reasonability of assumptions. ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","All right, and then just to get off this, this question might be one for an Investor Day, but while we are at it, the access product in the health area that are doing so well for you, how do you see those products working in 2013 and then in particular in 2014, once ACA is implemented. ","Rob Pollock","Yes, so I\u2019ll start and then I think Mike has some things he can add in, but the first things I\u2019d say is these products are resonating around affordability and choice. So everyone would like to have a Cadillac planned, but they don\u2019t all have a Cadillac budget, and the way we can put these products together allows them to say, this is what I really need and can afford and that combination has proven to be widely successfully as we talk to consumers. ","Mike Peninger ","And I think you are raising a great question and probably would be worth a more in-depth conversation at some point, but there is a lot of question about who exactly will be buying on an exchange starting in 2014 and given that the rules around exchanges really haven\u2019t been to find out exactly how the subsidies will work, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, that there is a school of thought that says, most of the buyers on the exchanges will be heavily subsidies, but that remains to be seen, so that\u2019s another things that will impact, but I think overall our belief is that healthcare costs are going to keep going up. ","As Rob said we got products that help people that don\u2019t have the Cadillac budgets deal with that reality and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to change even as the new world unfolds. ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay, let me ask this. These products, if my understanding is correct, if somebody post 2014 wants to buy these products, that person will be subject to the penalty\/tax, is that correct? ","Rob Pollock","They are theoretically, but already at least what I\u2019ve read is there are signals that its not going to be strongly enforced. ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay. All right, thank you guys very, very much. ","Rob Pollock","Sure.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. Lastly we\u2019ll go to the side of Mark Hughes with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Go ahead, your line is open. ","Rob Pollock","Good morning Mark.","Mark Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning. Are you seeing much progress on the health exchanges? Are they communicating with the industry? Are you getting some insight as to how they are going to work? What\u2019s going on there?","Rob Pollock","Yes, there is all kinds of different working groups on this. I\u2019d say that the federal exchange is furthest ahead. We have our own comity within Assurant health looking at all these things, but state by sate they\u2019ve got make decisions around, do I want to build my own exchange or be part of the federal exchange and they are trying to make those decisions. ","At the federal level it\u2019s a complicated process. They want to be able to, if you will, tap into tax returns and figure our subsidies that Mike was talking about earlier for the population. You can imagine there is a fair amount of complexity, but I think there is a lot of resource being put to being this to fruition.","Mike Peninger","I think it is another one though as Rob said Mark. Every state is really different and is going through their own calculus about do they want to build, do they want to tap into the federal, something certainly there is philosophical differences about the exchanges etcetera. So a lot of discussion, but the reality is we don\u2019t have clear rules or definitions yet. ","But saying all that, we are prepared to get ready to play on the exchanges that we deemed that\u2019s the place to be and as rules are clarified and make that decision. ","Mark Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Am I right in assuming that the products are going to be uniform across the state? ","Rob Pollock","No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean again, open question right. All that\u2019s really been outlined is a certain actuarial value of what\u2019s offered on the, we call it the metallic plant, gold, sliver, bronze. So they have to have a certain level of value, benefit value. My guess is lots of different ways to put those benefit values together, with the constraints of how some of the regulation is written. ","Mark Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Right, in California, I think you touched on some of this, but where you took those rate decreases, how did the economic, how are they impacted for, the services or other than the value chain lets say. You\u2019ve obviously laid down or laid out the impact that you are feeling. What\u2019s happening with others, not to name names, but generally speaking in those markets? ","Rob Pollock","Sorry, if you talk about the servicers, I can\u2019t speak to other insurers. For instance, if there is a commission being paid to the servicer, they are going to get a commission on smaller premium. If they are participating on a reinsurance basis, its going to operate a little bit differently. So its going to be very client specific in terms of how those issues operate. ","Mark Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Right, and of the decline in premium, what proportion of that are you bearing the brunt of it? ","Rob Pollock","Well, we tried to outline in our estimates the impact on net NOI mark in a fully implemented state with a number of caveats. Obviously we put an estimate together based on the size of assumptions. I tried to outline those assumptions in my prepared remarks that might be worth taking a look at rather than going through them, but we also said we are working on operating improvements so that we minimize that number.","Mike Peninger","But again as Rob said Mark, the policy or the premium goes down, then a client who is reinsuring will get the pro-rata reduction in their seated premium too.","Mark Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Right. Okay, thank you very much. ","Rob Pollock","Thanks for joining us this morning. We encourage you to reach out to Francesca and Suzanne with additional questions. We look forward on updating you on our progress in the months ahead. ","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Operator","Welcome to Assurant's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi","Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2014 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are: Rob Pollock, our Chief Executive Officer; Alan Colberg, our President and incoming Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter 2014 results. Both the release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Rob, Alan and Chris before moving into a Q&A session.","Some of the statements we make on today's call may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2013 Form 10-K. Today's call will also contain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted on assurant.com.","Now, I will turn the call over to Rob.","Robert B. Pollock","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we're pleased with our performance for the quarter, despite weaker results at Health. We continued to execute on our strategy by evolving our mix of business to produce more earnings and cash flow over time. We're actively managing our business and aligning resources to support our best opportunities.","In the third quarter and during October, we strengthened our mobile business with 2 acquisitions. First, we invested in a device repair facility in the U.S. to support our growing customer base and expand our logistics capabilities. Second, earlier this week, we signed an agreement to purchase CWI Group, a leading mobile insurance administrator in France, with approximately $40 million in annual fee income. In addition, we further enhanced our mortgage value chain offerings by acquiring eMortgage Logic. These deals are in areas we have targeted for growth and also fit our acquisition playbook. They will add long-term value to our business. During the quarter, we also announced an agreement to sell our general agency property and casualty business. In combination with continued expense discipline, we're finding additional resources to direct toward our best opportunities.","Our progress this year is evidenced in our performance against 3 key financial metrics: annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11% year-to-date; book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, has increased over 8% this year; and revenue, defined as net earned premiums and fees, was up 18% year-to-date, driven by expansion across all 4 operating segments and including an increase of more than $300 million in fee income. Our balance sheet remains strong. At quarter end, we have $560 million in corporate capital, including our $250 million capital buffer. Strong cash flow generation provides us the flexibility to grow both organically and through acquisitions and return capital to shareholders.","Now, I'll provide updates for each of our segments. Assurant Solutions delivered another strong quarter. The earnings improvement was primarily driven by our success providing services across the mobile value chain. The 2 acquisitions in mobile will further improve our operational efficiency and expand our distribution into France, one of the largest mobile markets in the world. At the same time, our core service contract business continues to perform well. We're adapting our distribution through e-tailers and original equipment manufacturers while moving resources away from certain retailers. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to strengthen our competitive advantage by meeting the needs of our customers. This will serve us well in a rapidly changing environment.","Assurant Specialty Property's results also were strong, reflecting the benign hurricane season. During the quarter, we broadened our product offerings to mortgage lenders and servicers by purchasing eMortgage Logic, a leading provider of residential valuation products and technology services. We now offer property appraisal, preservation and valuation services, which together are expected to generate more than $250 million in annualized fee income next year. We believe we can grow in future periods by offering more comprehensive solutions for our clients, even in the sluggish housing market. We've seen early confirmation of our strategy, as we expanded our business with new and existing clients.","Our position as a trusted adviser with a strong financial foundation is resonating. In 2015, we'll strive to profitably increase market share with value-added offerings. Our targeted growth strategy requires us not only to invest in new capabilities but also to redeploy assets when appropriate. This month, we announced an agreement to sell our general agency P&C business and its primary statutory insurance company, American Reliable. This sale highlights our strategic focus on the core lender-placed business and growth initiatives, including services to the mortgage and multi-family housing industries.","Let's now turn to Assurant Health. The segment's loss in the quarter was disappointing. We think it's important to explain the dynamics that affected results in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Last fall, during the first open enrollment, we made pricing assumptions about the risk pool of consumers buying policies in a guaranteed issue environment. We believe that existing policyholders who were required to transition to ACA plans would be healthier than new enrollees. However, changes in the rules announced last November and again in March allowed policyholders to extend their existing coverage through 2016. Therefore, ACA business had worse morbidity characteristics than we had assumed, and pricing of policies could not be modified. In January, we will reset pricing for all ACA policies. We believe our rate actions, plan design changes and increased scale through our distribution on select public exchanges will drive improved results.","Assurant Health submitted filings to participate on 16 exchanges during the ACA open enrollment period which begins next month. This will allow us to meet the needs of consumers who may purchase on the exchange. At the same time, we'll be able to provide integrated quoting and enrollment services to our national distribution partners for policies sold on or off the exchanges. At Assurant Employee Benefits, voluntary remains the growth engine, with premiums up 12% year-over-year. Our investments in voluntary to broaden our offering, expand our distribution and strengthen our enrollment capabilities continue to yield results. In addition, we renewed our dental network agreement with Aetna for another 3 years. This partnership helps to further strengthen our competitive advantage in the group benefits marketplace by providing a broader panel of dentists for our customers.","We're pleased with the transformation of our Employee Benefits business under John Roberts' strong leadership. Following John's retirement in January, Adam Lamnin will broaden his role and lead both Assurant Health and Employee Benefits. Although these businesses will continue to run separately, we believe there are additional opportunities to collaborate on distribution, realize efficiencies and more tightly align strategies on resource deployment. It's been a pleasure to work with John over the past 10 years, and I want to thank him for his many contributions to Assurant.","Across the company, we continue to adapt, strengthen and grow. We have strong momentum and we believe we can sustain our progress and successfully execute on our strategy. As I prepare to transition my duties, I'm especially pleased by the board's choice of Alan Colberg as President and incoming CEO in January. Alan is an accomplished executive. We've benefited from his counsel and guidance for many years, first at Bain & Company and since 2011, as a key member of our management committee. Alan has been influential in shaping our strategy, accelerating innovation and inspiring a customer focus throughout Assurant.","Before Chris elaborates on the quarter, I'd ask Alan to share a few of his thoughts on what's ahead. Alan?","Alan B. Colberg","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. We've been fortunate to have great stability with only 3 CEOs in the nearly 40-year history of Assurant. I am honored to succeed Rob as the fourth CEO.","Rob has set the tone and embodied the values and culture of Assurant. He's been instrumental in building the successful Fortune 500 Company Assurant is today. As Rob prepares to retire, our company is in a strong position competitively and financially. On behalf of our 17,500 employees, I want to thank Rob for his leadership, his many contributions and to wish him the very best in his retirement.","Looking ahead, I believe we can build an even stronger Assurant for the future. We remain committed to our aspiration of outperformance; for our customers, with products and services that meet their needs; for our employees, to be part of a great place to work; and for our shareholders, as we achieve top quartile performance against our peer group over time.","We are a company with a long history of adapting to external change, and we will continue to do so even as the environment rapidly evolves. My confidence is bolstered by the dedication and deep experience of our senior management team. Together, we will focus on 3 key priorities as we strive for outperformance. First, we will live our purpose to help protect what matters most to our customers. Second, we will understand consumers and clients' needs and innovate in the ways we serve them. And third, we will deliver profitable growth.","We have strong momentum today. As we emphasized during Investor Day, we will capitalize on macro trends to grow earnings long term. We will do so by meeting customer needs around their risk events, whether through specialty insurance products or related services. This will require us to innovate faster around end consumer needs to drive organic growth. At the same time, we must ensure operational excellence to become more efficient while also delivering outstanding customer experiences. Finally, we are committed to maintaining our track record of disciplined capital management by balancing organic growth, potential acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders to create value. In the next several weeks, I'll have the opportunity to visit with many of you, and I look forward to it.","With that, I'll now turn to Chris for more detailed comments on our third quarter results and outlook.","Christopher J. Pagano","Thanks, Alan. I share your confidence in our opportunities to build upon our strong foundation and momentum.","Now, let's take a closer look at our progress. I'll begin with solutions. Third quarter net operating income was $52 million, an increase of more than 40% from the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by mobile, where we continue to benefit from robust growth in covered devices in the U.S. and other international markets, continued favorable domestic loss experience and $5 million of additional income from client marketing programs. Our international operations also improved as the European restructuring initiated last year continues to generate savings. We are on track to fully realize our commitment of $25 million of annualized gross savings next quarter. The third quarter also included a $2.7 million impairment charge related to a software system that supports our domestic credit business. We continue to manage expenses closely as this business declines.","Turning to net earned premiums and fees. The continued success of our mobile and service contract offerings in the U.S. and Latin America drove a 22% increase in revenue. Our acquisition of Lifestyle Services Group in the U.K. also contributed to growth in the quarter. Given Solutions' strong performance year-to-date, we believe 2014 full year results will exceed our expectations. This is largely due to robust mobile performance, including additional income generated from client marketing programs, which may fluctuate year-to-year. As we look ahead to 2015, expansion from the targeted growth areas will help offset continued declines in domestic and European credit as well as runoff business from certain retailers. We believe that the investments we've made in mobile and international, along with ongoing expense management, will position us for earnings growth going forward.","Moving to Specialty Property. Net operating income was $105 million compared to $115 million in the third quarter of 2013. The decrease primarily reflects margin pressure from lower premium rates as we implement our new lender-placed product. Non-catastrophe losses increased slightly, driven by the higher frequency of claims from properties that moved to foreclosure. Net earned premiums increased by 7% in the quarter. We recorded some residual benefit from the discontinuation of a client quota share arrangement, partially offset by lower premium rates.","Fee income also increased significantly, primarily due to $55 million from Field Asset Services and StreetLinks. As a reminder, these fee income acquisitions carry higher expense ratios than our insurance products. For the quarter, Specialty Property's expense ratio increased by 640 basis points, of which nearly 500 basis points was attributable to our acquisitions in the mortgage value chain. In September, we announced that a client decided to transition approximately 600,000 loans with a higher-than-average placement rate. We anticipate the impact of this change will begin in the fourth quarter.","Looking ahead to 2015, we expect Property's net earned premiums will decline as our lender-placed business normalizes. Lower placement rates, a decrease in average premium rates and the previously mentioned loan transition will all contribute to lower revenue. In addition, the sale of American Reliable is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, annualized net earned premiums will decrease by approximately $250 million. This sale, however, will provide additional capital to be deployed in targeted growth areas throughout Assurant. Specialty Property's refined focus will allow us to generate profitable growth from multi-family housing and our mortgage value chain fee income products in 2015.","At Health, the net operating loss was driven by higher-than-anticipated claims on ACA policies. As a result, the loss ratio in the third quarter increased by 740 basis points year-over-year to 81.7%. The ACA plan extensions that Rob mentioned were the primary driver of this increase. Claims activity was only partially mitigated by the ACA reinsurance and risk adjustment programs. As of September 30, our estimated recoveries from the reinsurance and risk adjustment programs increased to $257 million, also a reflection of growth in premiums related to ACA plans. We will continue to refine these estimates as we review our historical claims payment patterns and receive additional market data. While we anticipate higher claims activity to persist in the fourth quarter, we believe new 2015 rates and plan design changes, along with increased scale and ongoing expense discipline, will improve results beginning next year.","Turning to Employee Benefits. Earnings doubled year-over-year due to improved disability results in the quarter. During the period, we also started the process to close one of our disability claims offices. This is another example of our efforts to streamline operations for better efficiencies. For 2015, we expect the voluntary business to continue to grow well in excess of the market rate. At the same time, we anticipate taking additional actions to lower our general expense ratio over the long term.","At Corporate, we ended September with $310 million in deployable capital. During the quarter, we paid approximately $30 million at closing for eMortgage Logic and our new mobile repair facility and returned $57 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Through October 24, we purchased an additional 571,000 shares for $36 million. We believe the stock remains attractively priced. Segment dividends year-to-date, net of infusions, totaled $252 million or 57% of segment earnings. By the end of the year, we expect to dividend total segment earnings to the holding company, subject to growth in the business and rating agency requirements.","As hurricane season draws to a close, our strong holding company capital position and segment dividend capacity should provide us with additional flexibility to repurchase shares and to make investments in our business organic or through M&A. As a reminder, the acquisition of CWI Group for $71 million is expected to close in the fourth quarter, while the sale of American Reliable for $114 million and the associated capital release will be a first quarter 2015 event. Our investment portfolio continues to perform well, and our low turnover strategy has helped to preserve the overall portfolio book yield. Should the current low interest rate environment persist, however, investment income will decline as the portfolio's book yield steadily migrates to the market yield.","Overall, we are pleased with the third quarter and performance so far this year. We continue to make progress against the strategic objectives we outlined at Investor Day as we grow and diversify earnings for the long term. In closing, Rob, I want to echo the gratitude we all feel for your many contributions to Assurant over your 33-year career and especially for your inspiring leadership as CEO. Your expertise and management style have set a tremendous example for so many of us. Thanks for the opportunity to learn from and work with you. And my very best wishes for the future.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from John Nadel of Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","They got Nadel and Agee right. Question for you on -- maybe a couple of questions around Health to start. And that is, I guess, can you give us any sense yet -- maybe you've gotten some state approvals already on rates -- on rate increases, but can you give us some help on understanding the magnitude of the rate increases, particularly those that you've already gotten approval on? What's that process entail? I mean, when will you know finally what your rates are going to be for new business starting January 2015? And whether it's -- based on your current assumptions, you're going to get to a point where it's sufficient to reverse this margin issue.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. Sure. So let me just start, John, a little bit looking back when we -- the whole Affordable Care Act was passed. And we set and embarked on a strategy around affordability and choice, okay? And as we looked at things, the first question we needed to know was, was that going to resonate? I think that, that proved, indeed, to be the case with our sales last year. And we also knew that 2014 was going to be a bumpy year because you just had a lot of discontinuous change going on. Our results were disappointed, but they're almost entirely explainable by what happened with extenders, which we've talked about a little bit. Because we can split our experience up and realize what's happened there. Now to your question on the rate increase side, we've been filing rate increases. They're going to be reflecting that new risk pool. And the good news is we've received approval in almost all states. There's a few that are still left, but they're substantial. They vary based on geography and location. But we're very confident they're going to meet what we need to make this business profitable in 2015.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And I think maybe just as a follow-up to that point. If you think about the assumptions that go into figuring out what kind of rate you need to get back to your targeted margins, I guess at what point in time did you really start filing these rate increases? Because it seems -- and maybe I'm wrong on this, but it sure seems like the negative performance of the ACA piece of the block really has -- I mean, maybe it started to show up much earlier this year, but it's really showing up in your GAAP earnings this quarter. So...","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. So let me start and then I think Alan might have a few comments to add. But we started filing in June. And if you think about what I mentioned earlier on our strategy, first thing we needed to prove was we could sell. Boy, we were able to prove that in 2014. We sold off exchange, sold plenty of it. But when we looked toward 2015 and as we saw experience emerge, we realize we needed more rate. And so we took aggressive action. But we've gotten our expenses down, we've gotten the scale, okay, in the business and now we're into refinements, which is right in our wheelhouse of what we're good at.","Alan B. Colberg","Yes. And John, let me add a couple of thoughts on kind of the future of Health. I think the important thing I would say is we're confident in the future of Health. If you look at the market, obviously, PPACA has created short-term disruption, but it creates long-term opportunities for us to continue to do what we've always done, which is adapt. And we have a strong track record in that business of being able to adapt and make very good margins. And when we look at 2015, we are confident results are going to improve, as a part because of the pricing actions that we just discussed, in part because of some plan design changes that we've made. And then we have continued the expense management discipline that has been a hallmark of the last few years, combined that with some additional scale as we expand distribution. And we feel results will be improving in 2015.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then just -- listen, I appreciate all those comments, right? I mean, and there's probably going to be a little bit of show me here to make sure that what's going through is going to really reverse this. And if I think about -- maybe just last question on Health is this. If you're assumptions are right and your pricing is right, is 2015 a year for Health, where you're getting toward your targeted margins? Or is it a transition year on the path toward those targeted margins? I don't know if I'm phrasing that quite well.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. So I think that what we've pointed out in the past, John, is it would take a few years to get to our ultimate goals. But you're going to see substantial progress next year and results getting better. I get you on show me because we've had the same discussions with Health and they've been able to demonstrate. And we can look and understand that extender impact on our business in some detail, which give us confidence.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then as it relates to the risk adjustment mitigating the $257 million, I think, you've got booked right now, when -- at what point -- how far into the future do we have to go? And how much more data do we have to see before you guys actually have that number figured out, to the point where there's little risk of movement in it up or down?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. So we're participating in 2 of the 3 mitigation Rs, if you will. Reinsurance, we've got that one pretty well understood, and it's just going to be a function of how the government decides to coinsure reimburse, whether it's going to be 80% or something higher. But we have all those claims identified and feel very good about it. We're just waiting for them to make a final determination on how they're going to distribute the money they've collected. On the risk adjuster, a little bit different, okay, because this is a need to compile up -- we know what our business looks like from a risk score, but it's not just that. It's our risk adjustment compared to the overall market. So you need an aggregation of all that data. And if you look this quarter, there were obviously a lot more experience brought into that. We thought our business was -- had a higher risk adjuster score than it ultimately has. And the reason it doesn't is, again, the overall pool was a little worse than we anticipated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Dargan of Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","As I look at the performance in solutions, you do call out subscriber growth in the press release. And I realize there are a lot of moving parts between premiums and fee income. But is there any way that we -- that you can provide us with, I guess, a subscriber count so that we could somehow tie that to something in building our models for that segment? It's just difficult for me to kind of get my arms around what the impact is.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. Understood. I think there's maybe 2 -- I'll make a couple comments and then Chris can provide some specifics. I think as we play across that mobile value chain, Sean, we've got some situations where the involvement with the subscriber may be deeper than it is with others. But we've got numbers on the subscribers. Chris, you want to just share some of them?","Christopher J. Pagano","Yes. Sean, yes, I think, I mean, the aggregate number for this quarter is $25 million globally. Now that's up 20% from the previous quarter. So there's significant growth in the business, again, validating our view that this is a targeted growth area for us. But I think as Rob points out, our interaction with those subscribers differs by client, by region, et cetera. But in aggregate, a 20% increase for a quarter-over-quarter.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay. And on Specialty Property, there was a mortgage industry publication that ran something indicating that there would be a new entrant who would come to market with premiums lower than presumably your QBE. Do you have any update or anything you can tell us about whether you see any evidence of that?","Robert B. Pollock","Well, this is a marketplace that's always been quite competitive, and there have been a lot of players there. We feel very good about our position based on how we've built our platform and operate. So we can't really comment on any particulars on who may enter or in the past, we've seen people leave the market. We feel very good about our position.","Christopher J. Pagano","Yes, Sean, it's Chris. I think, longer term, the outlook for the Property business in lender-placed is really about market forces, decline in the placement rate, lower premiums. It's really -- and all of which we factored into our forecast. Now having said that, we're not waiting around for that to happen, but we're looking to diversify the revenue sources, leveraging our role as a trusted adviser in the mortgage space, moving into a mortgage value chain, broadening our offerings, et cetera. So again, which we look for that to be in 2015, a $250-plus million source of fee income for us. So we -- again, the forces are going to create a normalization of the lender-placed business. We've factored that in. We still think it's going to be an attractive business, 20% returns, still a Specialty business for us and then leveraging that into these newer sources of fee income.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Hughes of SunTrust.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","You had talked about the voluntary business within Benefits growing, I think, well in excess of the market rate. What gives you confidence there? And then to what extent are exchanges, Health exchanges, or other private exchanges factoring into your strategy on voluntary benefits?","Robert B. Pollock","Sure. So we've been investing in the voluntary area for quite some time, and we think we're ahead on a variety of things that are needed to be successful in that marketplace. So we like our position in voluntary. We think that it will continue to expand. And I'll let Alan comment a little bit on why we think that in a moment. In terms of the private exchanges, though, to address that, Mark, it's been very small, and it's -- we're getting some learnings out of it. But I wouldn't say that it's taken hold yet. Alan, do you want to comment on voluntary for just a second?","Alan B. Colberg","Yes, thanks, Rob. And Mark, the way we've thought about this is thinking about where do we have macro trends in our businesses, that if we could get more resources appropriately against those trends, we could create long-term shareholder value. One of those trends is this evolution from employers paying for benefits to employees paying for benefits. Very similar to what happened in pensions, with defined benefit moving to defined contribution. We've seen the same thing developing in the voluntary space or in the work site space. So as Rob said, we've been investing against that for years. And I think we feel like we are out ahead of most of our competitors with capabilities, with distribution. And it also creates an interesting opportunity as we think about the announcement of Adam sitting on top of both Health and Benefits. Although those remain separate companies and we intend to operate them as separate companies, thinking about how we leverage some of those capabilities for our Health products is another interesting lever. So we're quite excited about that business. Our team in Benefits has a long track record of outperforming and growing that business. And I think you'll see us continuing to invest behind voluntary.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","What's the most important area? Is it the distribution relationships? Is it the product design? What's the key factor?","Robert B. Pollock","Actually, a lot of it is around enrollment and administration and making sure things that sound rather simple, like getting the bills right, sounds easy, does hard when you've got changes in employment going on. So what -- the employer is going to research the company and endorse it. But then, boy, you got to execute because they cannot afford to have issues around payroll.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from John Nadel of Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I may do this a few times. The -- I guess 2 quick ones. One, I think Chris, you said that, that subscriber number was up 20%. I just wasn't sure if it was on a year-over-year basis versus third quarter '13 or if that's a sequential growth rate.","Christopher J. Pagano","That number since year-end, John. Sorry.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that's since year-end. Okay, perfect. Another quick one for you guys. As you lose this block with a higher placement rate in 4Q, at least on a pro forma basis, how big of an impact does that have on the placement rate for 4Q? If we think about, relative to the third quarter placement rate, how much did that fall, approximately?","Robert B. Pollock","So I think what we've talked about, John, is about $80 million of premium annually, with roughly an 8% placement rate.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. I can do that. And then I guess a bigger picture question. Alan, I suppose as you're taking over, maybe I'd prefer to direct it to you, no disrespect to Rob or Chris.","Robert B. Pollock","Sure.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","You guys have -- you're in an enviable position, right, that you have a significant amount of current excess capital and on a pro forma basis by the time you close on the sale of American Reliable, significantly higher still. So I know you guys have talked about your priorities for deploying capital over time, and there's been a lot of consistency for a bunch of years on that. But I guess my question for you is this, Alan. How high will you actually let excess capital get before you really do feel like you've reached the limit, where anything above that amount just needs to be returned to shareholders, even if it's in an accelerated buyback or a special dividend? Have you given any real thought to that?","Alan B. Colberg","Yes, let me start, John. Our strategy on capital management is going to be unchanged. We're going to continue the approach that we've taken of kind of a balanced deployment of capital, looking at the best opportunities between returning capital to shareholders, investing in organic growth and, as appropriate, where the hurdle rates are met, selectively augmenting our capabilities or distribution with M&A. That's going to be unchanged. And I think you'll see us doing that. Really, what we're trying to do over time is create shareholder value through that combination of capital management. We're looking to grow the earnings. We are actively managing our resources and businesses as you've seen with the -- both the acquisitions and the divestitures in the recent quarter. We continue to invest selectively in capabilities. And so all of that brings us to what we're really focused on as we do this. And I'll ask Chris in a minute to talk about how we thought about M&A in that context of the overall capital management, is creating value through that disciplined capital management. To answer your question more directly, we're not going to set a specific number. We're going to continuously look at the market, look at the opportunities and make the right decisions to create shareholder value. But Chris, maybe you can talk a little bit about M&A in the context of that overall capital management.","Christopher J. Pagano","Yes, John, and again, to Alan's first point, the strategy is unchanged. And going forward, it -- we've always felt it was a combination of growth in NOI and returning capital to shareholders and growing per share -- NOI per share book value, et cetera, that was going to create long-term value. If you think about the last 5 years of activity, there's been consistency there. The key difference being the discipline around recognizing that the shares were significantly underpriced, and therefore, share repurchase was, in many ways, the only prudent use of deployable capital. The last 2 years, that's changed. We've moved closer to share -- to fair value on the share price but still believe it's attractive. And Alan's point again around discipline, if the -- deployable capital position, it will ebb and flow over time. I think the key here is we continue to generate cash from the operating companies, and that cash-generating power is our -- one of our biggest assets. And the goal is to take that asset and grow more cash flow. So again, I think -- and I think we've been consistent in the last 2 years around this combination in terms of returning it to shareholders and deploying it via M&A or organically. The one thing you comment on a special dividend, don't see that as a possibility. We think that -- we believe in -- that our shares are undervalued. So and prefer to be in the market consistently with respect to share purchase.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. And listen, don't take me the wrong way by asking the question. I agree completely that you guys have been consistent. I was just more thinking about it seems to be a growing dollar amount. And that was the nature of the question. Last one, real quick, is just on the sale of American Reliable. Is that the piece that's responsible for $250 million of premium that should come off the books? Is there anything around that?","Robert B. Pollock","No, that's it.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rob Pollock, CEO, for any concluding remarks.","Robert B. Pollock","As we close the call, I want to take a moment to thank my Assurant colleagues for their dedication. They make Assurant a special place to work. I also want to thank the investment community and investors for their time and interest in Assurant. As always, you can reach out to Francesca, Suzanne and Gesue [ph] with any follow-up questions.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release, as well as in our SEC reports.","Our previously announced acquisition of The Warranty Group is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As such, the 2018 outlook provided on today's call does not include any contributions expected from The Warranty Group acquisition, nor the financing plan.","During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. We delivered on our financial commitments to shareholders, while also building a stronger Assurant for the future. Specifically, for full-year 2017, we generated net operating income growth of 9%, excluding reportable catastrophes, well ahead of our initial expectations, due to business growth and $12.5 million of net one-time benefits.","Operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophes, grew by 22%, surpassing our long-term average annual target of 15%. And we completed the return of $1.5 billion in capital to shareholders, as planned. In 2017, we also achieved key milestones in our multi-year transformation, which we believe position our company for continued profitable growth.","We invested in our digital and data analytics areas and we also established capability centers for enterprise strategic account management, customer experience, robotics, and artificial intelligence. These are just a few examples of investments to strengthen our competitive advantage. Through our newly-formed enterprise procurement group and other initiatives, we've made good progress toward our $100 million gross expense savings target.","These savings, largely sourced from third-party spending, have and will fund ongoing investments in the business, while expanding margins over time. We've also continued to manage capital prudently with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Not only do we complete our return of $1.5 billion to shareholders, we also announced our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We believe this transaction positions us as a leading lifestyle provider with significant synergies, a platform for continued innovation, and a more predictable and diversified earnings stream.","In January, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation, we amended the transaction agreement to simplify the overall structure and optimize the financing plan. Importantly, tax reform provides meaningful savings to our operations which will benefit our shareholders, customers, and employees. Let me now share some of the highlights from the year for each of our operating segments.","Global Lifestyle's earnings grew 15% for the full-year, ahead of our average annual growth target of 10%, as we advanced our position as a strong lifestyle competitor with an attractive product and client mix. In Connected Living, we added new partnerships with leading global brands such as Comcast, Apple and most recently with KDDI in Japan. We now protect over 36 million covered devices worldwide with a growing portion of those devices leveraging our premium tech support capabilities.","Our vehicle protection business remained a strong performer in 2017 with nearly 10% revenue growth, operating ROE in the mid-teens, and solid cash flow. Our results reflect a continued volume growth from third-party administrators as well as our partnerships with leading OEMs. Our acquisition of The Warranty Group will expand our reach into complementary channels, such as dealer networks and national accounts, which will strengthen our overall position in the vehicle protection market.","In Global Housing, 2017 was marked by significant weather-related activity across the Caribbean, Mexico and the U.S., which resulted in $190 million of after-tax net reportable catastrophe losses. Despite the significant devastation, our Comprehensive Reinsurance Program provided broad multi-storm coverage to mitigate losses. Importantly, during this time, our employees responded exceptionally well to these events, providing support to those in need.","Looking at our underlying performance, excluding reportable catastrophes, Global Housing net operating income was roughly level with 2016. This was better than expected, driven by strong fourth quarter results within our lender-placed insurance and flood businesses. We made progress driving our operational excellence initiatives to mitigate declines in lender-placed.","In 2017, we ran pilots to migrate clients onto our single processing platform which will provide a more seamless customer experience and deliver operating efficiencies over time. So far, results are encouraging. Those savings from these efforts will not be realized until later this year and beyond. Lender-placed remains an important business for us, and all of this work will help us continue to be an innovative leader and maintain strong returns long-term.","In multi-family housing, we now protect 1.8 million renters across the U.S., an increase of almost 20% from 2016. This reflects our strong suite of products and superior customer experience. In addition to working through our property management and affinity partners, we continue to innovate and now offer products through new digital channels with partnerships with companies like TenantCloud, Cozy, and Sure (07:59).","Strong growth within multi-family housing helped offset declines in mortgage solutions where we continue to see weak market demand in new loan origination and field services. During 2017, we took actions to realize efficiencies in our mortgage solutions operations, including assessing our real estate footprint and operating platform. We do not expect a material improvement in the overall market in 2018 and we'll further adjust cost as needed.","Moving to Global Preneed, with $40 million of earnings in 2017, this segment continues to be a steady contributor to our business, supported by our alignment with market leaders, as well as expanded product offerings for the senior lifestyle market. We now protect around 1.9 million customers across North America.","As we look at 2018 and beyond, we are focused on leveraging our scale and expertise in both the lifestyle and housing markets to continue driving profitable growth. Across our businesses, we will look to enhance our customer focuses with an emphasis on strategic account management to deepen our client relationships and continuously improve the customer experience.","Sustaining innovation through investments in artificial intelligence in areas like the connected car and connected home will be important. This will be balanced by a steadfast focus on operational excellence as we continue to strengthen our technology foundation, drive margin expansion, and live our Assurant operating model.","We believe our talent remains a competitive advantage. In 2018 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our people and further champion a culture of engagement, growth, and performance as we build a stronger Assurant for the future. Our long-term commitment remains to grow earnings over time. And we're pleased that already in 2017 we have seen successful results from our transformation.","Based on our current plans for 2018, we expect Assurant net operating income, excluding catastrophe losses, to be up 10% to 14% from the $412 million reported in 2017. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by a lower consolidated effective tax rate and modest growth in underlying earnings, recognizing that includes $12.5 million of net one-time benefits which are not expected to recur.","As we announced previously, we expect our effective tax rate to decline to about 22% to 23% from 33% historically. While a significant portion of the tax savings will drive higher earnings, we currently plan to reinvest approximately one-third of those tax savings to support future growth across our enterprise. We will provide more details as plans are finalized by the second quarter of 2018.","Looking at underlying earnings, profitable growth is expected to be driven primarily by mobile in Connected Living, our multi-family housing, and vehicle protection businesses. We anticipate some additional declines in lender-placed and credit insurance, which will offset much of that growth. Expense savings from enterprise initiatives are also expected to continue. Operating earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, are expected to grow more than net operating income, driven by share repurchase activity during the past year.","Our current outlook for 2018 does not include any impact from The Warranty Group acquisition or the related financing plan. We'll update our outlook for the year when appropriate. In addition, we will refresh our long-term metrics and targets to reflect the enhanced financial profile of our combined operations. As we've stated previously, we're confident in our ability to grow earnings and cash flow long-term, and that our attractive business portfolio, combined with the more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified and predictable earnings. This will allow us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long-term.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our fourth quarter 2017 results and our 2018 outlook in greater detail. Richard?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $90 million, exceeding our expectations. When compared to the prior year period, results benefited from $40 million of lower reportable catastrophes, the absence of $20 million of lender-placed regulatory expenses, and more income from processing a substantially higher volume of claims under the National Flood Insurance Program or NFIP following Hurricane Harvey. We've now closed more than 90% of our NFIP flood claims, so we do not expect this level of income to continue into 2018.","In addition, fourth quarter 2017 results also reflected more favorable non-catastrophe loss experience. In the first half of 2018, however, we expect non-catastrophe losses to increase to more normalized levels, as well as reflecting typical winter and spring seasonality. Growth in multi-family housing and the new lender-placed loans on-boarded earlier this year also contributed to a strong fourth quarter. We will continue to see declines in the lender-placed portfolio in 2018 but at a slower pace.","Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined portfolio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses decreased to 75.2% from 105% in the prior-year period. Net reportable catastrophes in the quarter totaled $3.2 million pre-tax, a $62 million year-over-year decrease. Fourth quarter 2017 losses were mainly related to California wildfires and were partially offset by reduction in reinstatement premiums as claims for the third quarter hurricanes developed more favorably than initially expected. As a reminder, Hurricane Matthew occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 which resulted in elevated claims.","Excluding catastrophe losses, the risk-based combined ratio was 74.1%, down from 88.8% in the prior-year period. This improvement reflects the absence of regulatory expenses, higher than expected NFIP income, and better than average non-catastrophe loss experience. The pre-tax margin for the fee-based capital-light offerings was down 60 basis points to 10.6% as declines in mortgage solutions were partially offset by profitable growth in multi-family housing. Valuation and field services continued to experience lower client volumes and be impacted by market conditions.","Turning to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premium and fee income decreased 2% in the fourth quarter. Lower placement rates in lender-placed insurance and declines in mortgage solutions drove the decrease. Specifically, the placement rate dropped 22 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the third quarter.","This reflects both the overall improvement in the housing market and a higher mix of low placement loans. The overall reduction in Global Housing revenue was partially offset by policy growth, mainly from affinity partners in multi-family housing and premiums from new lender-placed loans on-boarded earlier in 2017. We do not expect additional revenue growth from these loans in 2018.","As evidenced last year, our Catastrophe Reinsurance Program is a critical component of managing our risk. In January, we placed around 65% of our 2018 program within the traditional reinsurance market. Rates were in line with the broader market, up 5% to 10% on a blended basis. We were also able to add another multi-year layer of protection and maintain certain key features like cascading in the event of multiple storms. As we do every year, we expect to complete and announce our program in July.","For full-year 2018, we expect Global Housing's underlying earnings to decline from 2017 before taking into account savings from tax reform. After reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20%, with some of the savings we invested in the business, we expect earnings to increase. 2018 should mark the last year of significant lender-placed declines, with an expected 4 basis point to 5 basis point quarterly reduction in the placement rate.","The rollout of our new single-source processing platform is expected to drive additional efficiencies, however, not until the end of 2018 and more substantially thereafter. Given this deployment schedule, our risk-based expense ratio will remain elevated through 2018. Our multi-family housing business is expected to generate continued profitable growth, driven by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships, as well as increased product penetration.","With regard to mortgage solutions, market conditions are still expected to be challenging. We are working hard to improve mortgage solutions' results, and we'll continue to drive operating efficiencies to mitigate some of the market weakness. In terms of revenue, we expect Global Housing to be roughly flat in 2018 as declines in lender-placed are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.","Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment reported earnings of $43 million for the fourth quarter, up $8 million year-over-year. The increase was driven primarily by higher mobile contributions from new and existing programs, more favorable loss experience, and a client recoverable of $5 million. We also saw continued growth from the vehicle protection business. Results were partially offset by declines from credit insurance as well as lower income from mobile repair and logistics due to lighter trade-in activity.","We no longer expect to see an increase in trade-in volumes in the first quarter of 2018 as sales of new smartphones have been lower than the industry originally forecasted. Turning to revenue, net earned premiums and fees were up $74 million or 9% in the quarter. This excludes a program structure change made at the end of 2016 for a large service contract client. Growth was mainly from increased mobile subscribers, including newly launched programs, which are performing well.","Vehicle protection was also a key driver. Results were partially offset by lower mobile trade-in activity, as noted earlier. Looking at the segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for risk-based businesses increased in the quarter to 96.3%, up approximately 70 basis points from fourth quarter 2016. The pre-tax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 5.4% in the fourth quarter, up from 3.7% in the prior period. The drivers for both metrics aligned with the net operating income commentary for the quarter.","In summary, we are pleased with our overall 2017 results with Global Lifestyle earnings up 15%, including some one-time benefits. So, while we expect Global Lifestyle's underlying earnings to increase in 2018, the increase is anticipated to be more modest. This is all before considering savings from tax reform. We expect earnings growth in mobile, including programs implemented during 2017. Mobile trade-in activity will depend on the success of new phone introductions, availability of these phones, and mobile carrier promotional activity.","Throughout 2018, we also anticipate continued profitable growth in our vehicle protection business, as strong sales from prior periods begin to earn. Credit insurance, however, will continue to decline, reflecting runoff business and discontinued partnerships. After factoring in the lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% and summary investments to support growth, Global Lifestyle reported earnings should be up more substantially in 2018.","Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $4.6 million in fourth quarter net operating income, a decrease of $6.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to a $5 million software asset write-down. Revenue in Preneed was up 9%, driven mainly by growth in Canada and sales of our Final Need product in the U.S. from strong sales in prior periods. Face sales decreased 4%, primarily due to lower Final Need sales and seasonality. Sales in this segment overall tend to be lower in the fourth quarter, leading up to the holidays.","In 2018, we expect Global Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly, driven by expansion from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. We're actively monitoring the impact of this particularly harsh flu season as it may result in more elevated mortality in the first quarter. Preneed results will also reflect a lower effective tax rate of roughly 22% with a portion of savings reinvested in the business.","At Corporate, the net operating loss was $29 million, an increase of $9 million. This was due to lower investment income and a $4.6 million charge related to workforce reductions. For 2018, we expect full Corporate net operating loss to be approximately level with the $63 million loss reported in 2017. After taking into account the lower tax rate of 20% and some level of reinvestments, we expect the net loss to increase to around $80 million.","Turning to capital, we ended the year with $540 million of total company capital or about $290 million of deployable capital adjusting for our risk buffer of $250 million. Dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed to the holding company totaled $108 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total dividends for the year to $229 million. This was lower than segment earnings, mostly due to a statutory deferred tax asset write-down of $95 million in the fourth quarter, following the enactment of tax reform.","In addition, $21 million of dividends were distributed from Assurant Health and Employee Benefits as we continue to release residual capital associated with these businesses. We have now distributed nearly all the capital that had previously supported these businesses, and therefore do not anticipate any material additional dividends.","During the quarter, we also repurchased $139 million of shares and paid $30 million in shareholder dividends. We now have completed the $1.5 billion return of capital since 2016 at an average share price of $87.09. In 2018, we expect dividends from operating segments to be at least equal to segment operating earnings. This is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements, as well as the impact of tax reform.","We believe that this will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses, including setting aside funds to complete our Ik\u00e9 investment and support The Warranty Group integration. And, as always, share buyback activity will be subject to market conditions and our overall financing plan for The Warranty Group.","We're also hard at work on integration planning and our efforts are on track with an expected close in the second quarter of 2018. Last week, we reviewed The Warranty Group's preliminary results for the full year. While their close process is not yet completed, results for the year finished strong and in line with our expectations.","As Alan noted earlier, we plan to update our outlook, as needed, to reflect The Warranty Group acquisition and related financing plan. In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong results for 2017 which provide a solid foundation to provide profitable growth in 2018 and we remain excited about our future prospects.","And, with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Morning. In the Global Lifestyle, did I hear you properly that the Q1 smartphone sale is a little lower than originally forecasted? Is that correct? And then do you think those are pushed out? I know there have been plenty of headlines about the Apple's production schedule, that sort of thing. Do you think it will accelerate as we go through the year?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, Mark, we started talking about this back on the last earnings call that we just weren't seeing the volume of smartphone sales that the industry had predicted. Both the combination of delay in the launch of some smartphones and then I think these consumers have not been really enamored (26:17) with the latest ones. So, I think the important thing though for us, our mobile business has continued to grow well. We've added significant new clients. But you're correct. We do not see a pickup in new smartphone sales in Q1, so that will mute that piece of our business in Q1.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Then the impact of tax savings \u2013 is that going to translate into higher cash flow or are there some more offsets in terms of the cash benefit? And then when you talk about the use of those savings, should we think of those as more capital expenses or operating expenses that might impact margins?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Good morning, Mark. It's Richard. We don't see a significant difference in sort of the GAAP tax rate and the tax cash rate going forward. I mean, there can be small differences, but we're not seeing anything significant, which then means it will be cash available for investing in the business, or dropping down to the bottom line, as Alan said in the remarks. We do envisage reinvesting about a third of that back into the business.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. And, Mark, think of those as OpEx. So, we have a very high hurdle as we do with everything on how we deploy those dollars, but they'll run through the P&L as OpEx.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And at least, as far as your 2018 plans, that's already contemplated in the guidance?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yes.","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Yes.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","The mortgage solutions business, at least with respect to the slowdown in refis, it seems like we sort of \u2013 we're lapping, in Q1, Q2 we should lap the drop in refis after the election in 2016, after the interest rate spike. Is there something more to the weakness in mortgage solution or would you agree with the proposition that assuming refis are at least stable, purchase markets improving that the mortgage solutions business ought to stabilize and maybe start to grow again?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, Mark, importantly, I think, there is some seasonality in that business. So, generally, the winter is not a time of a lot of activity relative to other parts of the year. Certainly, if we have a better-than-expected market environment for originations, that would benefit our business. Our outlook is still cautious about what the market is going to be, and we've adjusted our cost structure accordingly. But, certainly, if we had a more robust environment \u2013 also importantly, a large part of our business there is countercyclical. So, if we do have any kind of slowdown in housing that will benefit both mortgage solutions and our lender-placed business.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Then, a final question, the impact of the hurricanes on placement rates. It seems like there's been a lot of delinquencies in mortgages around the hurricanes in Texas and Florida. Did that benefit you at all in the quarter?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. Mark, it's Richard. We're really not seeing. If we look at the numbers and the placement rates and the change in those, we really haven't seen an impact from the hurricane and so forth weather-related events on moving that number. I mean, obviously, the policies that we have in place, those are the claims we're paying on those policies in place but we haven't seen an impact I would say sort of on the top line.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I had a few questions. First, just on free cash flow. Historically, it's been fairly close to your reported earnings. Do you expect a major change following tax reform? And then as you look in \u2013 clearly, buybacks are going to be lower in 2018. But as you look to 2019 and beyond, what's your thinking about investing into additional acquisitions versus buybacks and how should we \u2013 like what are the priorities for free cash flow deployment beyond 2018? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Jimmy. In terms of the impact, free cash flow, the tax reform, similar to the Mark's question, I think what we're seeing is as we go forward that effective tax rate is, if someone will be paying the cash taxes will be similar to that. So, we'll obviously benefit from the lower tax rate. That will increase our cash, but no longer-term expectations other than that.","And then, moving into your question on capital and share repurchases, and then, sort of, longer-term 2019 and beyond so to speak, I think one thing that we've stressed and that we'll continue to do is to be extremely disciplined about our capital. And when we're looking at our capital and profits and cash flow, looking at what we need to invest in the business to keep growing and reinvest that growth, we'll be looking at obviously our dividend policy, we'll be looking at M&A and we'll be looking at the repurchase activity in there.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, on just the vehicle business. I think premiums and fees were up almost 20%. Was there any \u2013 and that's an acceleration from where you've been recently. So, what's driving that? And I realize the lag in accounting between when you book the business and when you earn it. But what's driving that and do you think the fourth quarter level is sustainable or was there something in there that might not repeat in the first quarter and beyond?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for the question. In terms of the vehicle protection services, obviously, it's a great business for us. It's had great historical track growth and we expect it to continue. Particularly with our acquisition of The Warranty Group, we're excited about this line of business. It's true. Quarter-over-quarter, there was an increase in 19%. I tend to look more on the year-over-year change. It was up 10%. And, as you say, there's the earnings we did in the past. So, we're seeing the growth in the past come through. And that growth should continue to come through as we've done well in the past periods. Quarter-to-quarter, it is spotty. Sometimes we get reporting that comes in and it's a little bit lumpy. So, that can change a quarterly number.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, just lastly on mortgage solutions, I think premiums and fees in that business are down almost 20%. So it didn't seem like the market for your products is down as much. So it seems like you've lost \u2013 obviously, the markets affected you as well. But it seems like you've lost share as well. So, just some color on what's going on in that business.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yes. So, Jimmy, I think as we talked about in some of the earlier earnings call, we did have some issues as we implemented a new technology platform mid last year that caused us to lose a little bit of business and allocation. But since that, we're more tracking the market. And that's about the level of down we're seeing across the businesses that we play in at the moment.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you.","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for participating in today's call. We're very pleased with our performance in 2017. And in 2018, we're focused on delivering on our commitments and closing our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We look forward to updating everyone on our progress on our first quarter earnings call in May. In the meantime, please reach out to Suzanne Shepherd and Sean Moshier with any follow-up questions. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only-mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi","Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full-year 2014 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday afternoon we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter and year-end 2014 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at www.Assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A.","Some of the statements on today's call may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2013 form 10-K and third-quarter 2014 form 10-Q.","Today's call also will contain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the Company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at Assurant.com. Now I will turn the call over to Alan. Alan?","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. In 2014 we made progress as we adapted to the changing marketplace and built additional capabilities to drive profitable long-term growth. While we are disappointed by weaker-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter, we're taking decisive actions to improve profitability. We see great opportunities ahead as we pursue our aspiration of sustained out-performance for our customers, employees and shareholders.","In 2014 we generated strong free cash flow. In support of our strategy to grow and produce attractive shareholder returns, we invested $162 million to complete four acquisitions. We returned $296 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, and we ended the year with $560 million of holding company capital.","For the year, we delivered 9.7% operating ROE excluding AOCI, below our target due largely to an operating loss at health. Book value, excluding AOCI, grew by 9% compared to year-end 2013.","We are pleased with our top line results. Revenues increased 16% to $9.7 billion through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. The key drivers of this performance were our targeted growth offerings, which now account for a quarter of total revenue. More importantly, earnings from these product lines tripled year over year.","We will continue to shift resources toward these targeted areas, as we believe they will drive growth in earnings and cash flow longer term. Our recent divestiture of American Reliable Insurance Company is another example of our actions to realign capital to support our long-term profitability objectives. I want to thank the American Reliable employees for their service and the seamless transition to Global Indemnity.","During 2014 we also broadened our specialty insurance products with additional adjacent fee-based services related to a variety of risk events. Across Assurant we generated more than $1 billion of fee income for new and existing offerings, an increase of 76% from 2013. These results demonstrate our progress in building a stronger Assurant for the future.","As we adapt to market changes, we must accelerate our efforts in 2015 to achieve profitable long-term growth. As an enterprise, we will focus on three strategic priorities.","First, we will innovate faster around the end consumer to generate organic growth. Second, we will continue to drive operational excellence to become more efficient while delivering outstanding customer experiences. And third, we will maintain our commitment to disciplined capital management.","We view our stock as attractively priced and will balance investing in our business with returning capital to shareholders. We are working hard to achieve these strategic priorities.","Let me now share updates on each segment. Assurant Solutions delivered exceptional results in 2014 by offering innovative programs across the mobile value chain in the US and a number of international markets. As we look ahead, mobile remains the largest growth opportunity for Solutions.","Our acquisitions of Lifestyle Services Group in 2013 and CWI Group last October enabled us to expand our global footprint in distribution. We will continue to consider select investments to enhance our competitive position.","As smart phones, appliances and other consumer electronics intersect, Solutions is focused on providing comprehensive protection through our connected living platform. Our expertise in the warranty and mobile business, coupled with our broad distribution, uniquely positioned us to deliver integrated solutions to our clients.","For example, we recently partnered with Claro Brazil, one of the largest mobile operators in Latin America, to introduce a smart phone upgrade plan that includes device protection. This program enables consumers who otherwise could not have purchased those devices to join the connected world.","As competition intensifies across the industry, there will be additional opportunities to expand our market share, but occasionally we will lose business. Recently a client notified us of its decision to transfer their tablet protection program to an affiliated company starting in the second quarter of this year.","While we are disappointed to lose this business, we believe our tailored solutions in the mobile value chain and superior customer service will continue to be key differentiators in the industry.","Pre-need is another important business for Solutions and remains a solid performer. While widespread flu this season could increase mortality, we expect pre-need to grow as we benefit from SCI's expanding share of the US funeral market. These opportunities at Solutions, along with our disciplined investments, will help us build on last year's success.","Let's now look at Assurant Specialty Property. This segment benefited from another year without significant hurricane activity. Property took many steps last year to drive operational excellence while moving resources toward our targeted growth areas.","Our alignment with leading mortgage servicers remains a key differentiator and competitive strength for Property. As expected, the normalization of Lender-Placed insurance will pressure results near term.","In 2014 we started to invest in initiatives to standardize our Lender-Placed platform to increase efficiency. We expect these investments and ongoing actions to generate net savings later this year, and beyond, to help maintain specialty returns. Our strong capital position allows us to invest in targeted areas to drive profitable growth and diversify our business model. We are pleased with our progress thus far.","Our acquisitions of Field Asset Services, StreetLinks and eMortgage Logic, which now comprise our mortgage solutions business are performing ahead of our revenue expectations. We're capturing market share and now expect to generate $300 million of fee income from these acquired businesses in 2015.","At Assurant Health 2014 marked a year of substantial change with the introduction of guaranteed issue and the public exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. For the first time during an open enrollment period, we participated on exchanges in 16 states.","Individual major medical plans sold off on and off the exchanges, drove significant sales increases in the fourth quarter. While we are encouraged to see our products resonate with consumers, our focus must remain on driving profitability and achieving specialty returns.","The loss for the year was disappointing and reflected persistently high ACA claims experience. As we have noted, mandated coverage extensions introduced after the industry had set 2014 pricing, drove higher overall market morbidity and significantly affected results.","In response, we've taken action, effective January 1 we implemented plan design changes and increased premium rate substantially for all 2015 ACA policies. We also lowered commission levels in certain distribution channels across several states to further manage risk. We believe the actions we are taking, along with ongoing expense discipline should improve results in 2015.","Assurant Employee Benefits results were driven by overall favorable experience and growth in Voluntary Products. Revenue from this targeted area increased by 12%, well in excess of the market. We believe Voluntary will remain the growth engine of benefits as employers shift more of the selection process and benefits cost to their employees.","As the market continues to evolve, Employee Benefits will partner even more closely with Health in a number of areas. For example, the segments are looking at opportunities to leverage their broad distribution networks and sales programs. They are also evaluating operating efficiencies to prove the customer experience and strengthen returns.","As I moved into the role of CEO, I'm energized by our employees as we strive to make Assurant stronger for the future. Across the organization we are accelerating our actions on multiple fronts to enhance efficiency, to invest for long-term profitable growth and to prudently manage capital for the benefit of shareholders.","Now Chris will review results for the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?","Chris Pagano","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions, which delivered another strong quarter. Net operating income was $58 million, $36 million higher than the prior year. Continued growth in covered mobile devices and favorable domestic loss experience drove results. We also recognized $5 million of income from client marketing programs, a decrease from prior years.","Results also benefited from operational efficiencies due to the restructuring efforts that we began in 2013. Net earned premiums and fees were nearly $1 billion as we delivered more integrated services in mobile, an area that we have targeted for growth.","In our core business, higher revenue from vehicle service contracts and production at a domestic service client also contributed to the strong quarter. Declines in non-growth areas such as domestic credit tempered growth and overall Solutions revenue was partially offset by foreign exchange pressures in Canada and Latin America.","For the full year Solutions delivered record top-line and earnings, far exceeding our expectations. In 2015 we expect revenue and earnings to remain level with the prior year.","Growth in our mobile and vehicle service contract businesses will offset the loss of a tablet program which accounts for roughly $100 million of annualized premiums and fees. In addition, there is potential for a decline in client marketing income.","As we continue to expand our business globally, we also anticipate near-term foreign exchange headwinds. We will continue to invest in mobile and other core products to enhance our competitive position as non-growth areas contract.","Now let's look at Specialty Property. In the quarter net operating income was $71 million. This compares to $108 million in 2013, which was a near record quarter due to higher-than-average renewals and new Lender-Placed portfolios.","There were several factors contributing to the year-over-year earnings decline, including lower placement and premium rates, margin compression from the previously disclosed loss of business and higher non-catastrophe losses, including claims from hailstorms early in the quarter.","Net earned premiums were $595 million, down 9% from 2013. The market and client factors mentioned earlier, along with uneven timing of loan additions and renewals, drove the decline.","While overall revenue at Property was down, targeted growth areas contributed approximately $140 million in the quarter. Premiums from multi-family housing grew 20% year over year as we expanded our distribution. Fee income rose 80%, primarily from acquisitions and market share gains in mortgage solutions.","For the quarter, Specialty Property's expense ratio increased 530 basis points, of which nearly 400 basis points was due to our shift toward fee-based products and services. The remaining 130 basis points relates to lower Lender-Placed premiums.","In 2015 we expect further declines in revenue and earnings at Property due to the normalization of Lender-Placed insurance and the sale of American Reliable. The potential for increased catastrophe activity could also affect results.","The initiatives underway to lower expenses in the Lender-Placed area and expand margins for mortgage solutions will help mitigate some of the declines, with net savings expected in the latter part of this year. Importantly, these actions will help us maintain attractive returns long-term.","Turning to Health, the net operating loss of $37 million was driven by higher-than-expected loss experience on ACA policies, which was only partially offset by risk mitigation programs. During the quarter, Health adjusted its accruals under these programs to reflect higher claims and increasing market morbidity.","As a reminder, risk adjustment recoverables are based upon each carrier's risk relative to the market. In the fourth quarter we accrued $9 million under this program, a lower amount compared to the third quarter 2014, reflecting higher overall market risk.","Recoverables under the reinsurance program totaled $133 million for the period. For the full year our total estimated recoveries from the risk mitigation programs were approximately $400 million.","The expense ratio at Health declined 370 basis points year-over-year as we benefited from greater scale and continued operational discipline. As a reminder, results for the quarter included $5 million for the ACA annual insurer fee. This required annual expense will increase from $20 million to $28 million in 2015, and is non-tax deductible.","During the past several months we've taken aggressive steps to drive toward our long-term profitability goals. While the market will continue to evolve, we expect results to improve this year.","At Employee Benefits, fourth-quarter earnings declined to $7 million primarily due to lower disability recoveries compared to 2013. Given the low interest rate environment, we reduced our discount rate 25 basis points for new long-term disability claims beginning October 1. We will continue to monitor interest rates and take additional actions as needed.","Benefits' expense ratio decreased 60 basis points, reflecting premium growth. As with Health, expenses include the health insurer fee. In 2015 Employee Benefits' share will increase by $2 million to $8 million for the full year.","Overall, we expect Voluntary to grow in excess of the market once again in 2015. At the same time, we will take further actions to lower our general expense ratio toward our long-term target of 23%.","Moving to corporate, we ended December with $310 million in deployable capital. During the quarter we paid $71 million for the CWI Group, we returned $20 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and we repurchased $102 million worth of stock.","Overall for the full-year 2014, the company repurchased 3.3 million shares or nearly 5% of our common stock outstanding. This year through February 6, we have repurchased an additional 529,000 shares for $35 million.","Total segment dividends in 2014, net of infusions, were $450 million below earnings as we funded growth in Health. We expect 2015 segment dividends to approximate segment operating earnings. As always this is subject to rating agency requirements.","Capital releases from Lender-Placed insurance will help fund organic growth in other product areas. The proceeds from the sale of American Reliable will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital.","In 2014 the corporate loss declined $15 million to $68 million, reflecting lower employee benefit and acquisition-related expenses compared to 2013. We expect additional reductions this year as we implement other expense initiatives.","Fourth quarter results also included an $8 million reduction in the amortization of a deferred gain related to an annuity business we sold in 2001 through reinsurance. This had no impact on cash flows and does not change the total amount of amortization over the life of the contracts.","While the investment portfolio continues to perform well and our low turnover strategy has helped us preserve book yield, a prolonged low interest rate environment will result in further declines in investment income.","Before we open the line for questions, I want to mention an upcoming change to our financial reporting that we will implement in the first quarter. At the Company's IPO, goodwill on our balance sheet was held at corporate, as the majority of it related to legacy transactions.","Starting this year, the $840 million of goodwill at corporate will now be included on segment balance sheets. $540 million at Solutions and $300 million at Specialty Property. This will have no impact on Assurant's consolidated results.","In 2015 our focus remains on executing our strategic objectives as the markets evolve. We believe the actions underway across Assurant will help us deliver long-term profitable growth to our shareholders.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from John Nadel with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Good morning, John.","Chris Pagano","Hey, John.","John Nadel","Good morning, everybody. I guess the first question for you, Alan, on Health. In your outlook commentary and in your prepared remarks as well as Chris', we should see improved results in 2015. I'm just wondering how we should think about quantifying that? Last year Management said that the Health segment would be modestly profitable in 2014, and yet it lost $64 million.","I recognize a lot has changed, but I'm trying to understand in terms of order of magnitude what kind of improvement you are actually expecting to see in 2015? Should that loss be cut in half? Should all the actions taken get this business back to modestly profitable back quickly? How do we think about that?","Alan Colberg","Hey, John, I appreciate the question. Let me start with the commentary on what happened in 2014. Yes, you are correct, that was our expectation going into the year with the pricing that we put in place.","As we've talked about, the rules changed after we set pricing, and after the whole industry set pricing. That dramatically altered the risk pool in 2014 and made the market much sicker than had been expected.","John Nadel","No question, yes.","Alan Colberg","That's what really influenced 2014 results. The good news about 2015 is it's a new cohort. We were able to raise our prices aggressively and appropriately to reflect the experience we expect will happen in 2015.","We've made significant plan design changes really by analyzing what happened in 2014 and trying to address any adverse selection effects. You saw the commission reductions we took to moderate sales. And with on our ongoing expense discipline, we think results will improve in 2015 with the goal of profitability.","John Nadel","Okay. Maybe to help folks, Alan, maybe a weighted average or some way of thinking about, you said significant rate increases for 2015. Can we get a sense for that, even if it's a ballpark?","Alan Colberg","Well it's early to know what will happen in 2015, but our rate increases on average were in the double digits and closer to 20%.","John Nadel","Thank you. And then a couple questions on Specialty Property. I'm curious how we should be thinking about the non-cat loss ratio. I'm asking because there's actually been quite a bit of volatility on a quarterly basis in that non-cat loss ratio during 2014.","Maybe a couple of quarters it looked like it was pretty favorable, a couple of quarters maybe unfavorable. How do we think about what a reasonable run rate is? Or a starting point as we start to think about the negative consequences of further premium rate reductions working through the book?","Chris Pagano","Hi, John, it's Chris. A couple things. Remember, the ratio is going to be a function of lower premiums coming through, so we're going to see that drift a little bit higher. When I think about cat versus non-cat, there are some weather events that don't qualify for cat. In the fourth quarter in particular we had some hailstorms that did not meet our definition of cat, but were weather nonetheless.","So $5 million to $7 million in the quarter in particular. And then again, as we move through the normalization of Lender-Placed and properties are in foreclosure for longer, you're going to see slight drifts higher in the non-cat loss ratio.","John Nadel","Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then one last one for you on Specialty Property. The placement rate, I'm curious, this fourth quarter was the quarter you lost that 600,000, loans track. It seemingly had up pretty high placement rate.","I think we were estimating somewhere around 7.5%, 8% placement rate on that block that left you in the quarter. And yet the overall segment placement rate only dropped 5 or 6 basis points on a sequential basis. Is there some catch-up we should expect to see as we move into calendar 2015? Is there something else at play there?","Chris Pagano","Yes, I think so, a couple things. There's always going to be a little bit of mismatch that's a point-in-time estimate with respect to the placement rate. The block will flow through over time, so you will start to see it drift a little bit lower.","But again, going back and in context, it's the normalization of the Lender-Placed business that's going to produce this decline in placement rate. I think we've talked about 1.8% to 2.1% longer-term. And again, if you look at the continuum, you're starting to see that come into play.","John Nadel","Okay. And then one last overarching question on Lender-Placed. There is seemingly no end to the turmoil at Auckland and some of its related affiliates. I understand you guys have a pretty deep relationship with them on the Lender-Placed side.","I'm just wondering, can you give us any color on what kind of impact, if any, you believe, any outcomes, radical outcomes with Auckland could place upon you?","Alan Colberg","John, we are not going to comment on a specific client. I think the important thing to remember as you think about our Lender-Placed business, is we play across all of the different parts of that industry and all the different types of servicers. So we are well aligned with whatever might happen in the marketplace and well positioned to be still the provider of choice in Lender-Placed.","John Nadel","Okay. I appreciate that comment. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Good morning, Mark","Mark Hughes","Good morning. How much capital would you anticipate might come free in the Specialty Property business on top of earnings?","Chris Pagano","So we've given some long-term guidance around that, 52% to 57% of net earned premium over time. Again, keep in mind as you think about the Specialty Property business in aggregate, you're going to see the freeing up of capital from Lender-Placed, redeployment in the targeted growth areas around Mortgage Solutions in particular, multi-family housing.","And then don't forget ARIC. The sale of ARIC released a significant amount of capital. I think long-term even with goodwill being held at Property, the $300 million, we still think 20% ROEs are possible, and are targeting that. And I think that, again, meets our definition of Specialty.","Alan Colberg","Mark, let me add on to Chris's comments, just a couple of thoughts on capital management the way I think about. Which is, we have a very strong a portfolio of businesses that generate substantial free cash flow. And as you saw, we expect that to approximate segment earnings this year for us. That combination creates real value for our shareholders.","And we have, I think, a good track record of deploying that capital effectively. And as I said in the prepared remarks, I'm committed, we are committed, to continuing to balance returning capital to shareholders with appropriately investing in future growth. And I think you see evidence of that over time.","Mark Hughes","Thank you for that. And then the $400 million that's a receivable from the government, could you talk about your confidence that you've done this properly? Is there some question about that? Are there some assumptions that you've had to make? How much confidence do we have that, that money will come to you?","Chris Pagano","So again, that $400 million has got two pieces to it. So you've got $275 million or so in the reinsurance recoverable, which is a mathematical calculation, $45,000 retention and then the co-participation up through $250,000 on claims. Feel a high degree of confidence in that number.","The risk adjuster, we have confidence in our own number, but it is our risk score relative to the market. I think that's where there is a little more of an estimation process that we have to go through. Every quarter that goes on we get more information, not only on our own block but the rest of the market, as third-party providers are aggregating data. Again, the number is our best estimate as of year-end.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Good morning, Seth","Seth Weiss","Hi, good morning, everybody. First, I want to ask a couple questions on Health. First, Alan, you mentioned the goal of profitability in 2015. Is this the same as a target of profitability? And I don't mean to split hairs here, I'm just trying to level set for 2015.","Alan Colberg","I think the decisive actions we've taken so far are we expect results to improve. We're going to monitor very closely with Health, how things develop as the year go by. We will take additional decisive action, but it is a goal of profitability.","Seth Weiss","Okay, thank you for that. And my biggest question on Health is the question of the risk adjusters. I understand the pressure from the extenders on 2014 and how that gets corrected on 2015. This quarter it seemed to be that the accrual of the adjuster was a large reason of the under-performance.","That is seemingly a very difficult thing to predict when you're trying to predict the health of the broader risk pool. How critical is that adjuster accrual in your pricing and goals for 2015?","Chris Pagano","Well again, the risk adjuster in terms of the aggregate recoverable we've got for 2014, it's a little more than a quarter. So the reinsurance recoverable is the larger piece where we have a higher degree of confidence, since there's no market estimation involved there.","But again, the way I think about it is all of the participants have an interest in understanding the market risks so that they can properly estimate their risk relative to the market. But there is some estimation in there. We feel pretty good, but again, it's the first time through. And then again, 2015 is a different story.","Alan Colberg","Seth, I think it's important to tell this tale of the two years because they are different. 2014 when the industry had an expectation of a risk pool, that was changed after the fact by the extenders. 2015, we're able to look at an expected risk pool. There hasn't been any intervention to change that expected risk pool so far. So again, it's an estimation, but 2015 maybe a very different year for market morbidity than 2014 was.","Seth Weiss","Is it fair to assume that within your pricing assumptions, given the pricing action that you've taken and the change in cohort that you described, is it fair to assume that your reliance on the risk adjusters next year is significantly less than what you had assumed the reliance would be in 2014?","Alan Colberg","Yes, it's hard to say for sure. There are a couple things going on with the risk programs that we need to be careful, as we think about 2015. One is the reinsurance program is gradually phasing out. It phases out completely after 2016. With the risk adjuster it really is going to be a function of what the market morbidity is.","Now our ACA block is substantially bigger in 2015 as the market switches is to the metallic plans. So the risk adjuster program remains very important to us as we go through the year.","Seth Weiss","Okay, thank you. And then one question on the increased insurance fees. I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correct. This is a direct hit to the tax line, right? So that's after-tax impact that you've given and no impact to the expense ratio. Am I thinking about that right?","Chris Pagano","The fee is not tax-deductible but we are allowed to price for in our rates.","Seth Weiss","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Good morning, Sean","Sean Dargan","Good morning, thank you. I have a big-picture question about Health. You have a target for profitability in 2015. It's not generating cash flow that's being dividended up to the holding company. I'm wondering, how hard would it be to walk away from this business? Is there a political pressure to stay in this business? What's preventing you from just stopping renewals and freeing up capital?","Alan Colberg","Sean, I'm not going to speculate on what we might or might not do with Health over time. We have a commitment to our shareholders though, that we're going to be Specialty businesses that can generate Specialty returns. We are constantly looking at Health and whether we can achieve it under the new reality of the ACA world. We're going to take action. You've seen us take action. We're going to continue to take action. We'll take the appropriate action if it's not a specialty business over time.","Sean Dargan","Okay. That's all I had, thank you.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Operator","The last question is coming from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Steven Schwartz","Hey, good morning, everybody I got a few.","Alan Colberg","Hi, Steven.","Steven Schwartz","Staying on the risk adjusters, do you have -- what did you base this on? Do you have industry data already that you can look at and use, not only to figure out for this year but use for next year?","Chris Pagano","Yes, there's a company called Wakely, a third-party provider who's been aggregating the industry data over the course of 2014 and providing it to those participants. We have been adjusting our accrual based upon how our estimate of our risk score relative to the market data, as provided by Wakely.","Steven Schwartz","Okay, presumably the extenders coming in, they're going to be more healthy. On the other hand, you have this big push, there are healthcare.gov ads on every day here in Illinois. You see that offsetting? More people that were in the program last year, probably less healthy, you got the extenders, they are probably more healthy?","Chris Pagano","I guess our basic premise is the first people to participate in healthcare were the least healthy. And as the block grows it will become, in aggregate, healthier. And that's been the promise that we've operated under since the beginning.","Alan Colberg","I think it's important, Stephen, just one other comment. I think it's important as we've thought about that, we've really worked hard on the plan design and with the pricing to reflect what we think is going to happen. And then we've used the commission changes that we made to try to get the sales in the places where we want them to be.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. I guess, the one thing I'm looking at is, who knows how things work out this year with all the new people coming in. But at some point you get to a stable market. Everybody is in who is going to be in. At that point these things become much easier, no?","Alan Colberg","We expect, I think the industry expects, the market to normalize beginning more -- it should normalize somewhat in 2015 just without the extenders. By 2016, 2017 it should become a more predictable, more normalized market.","Steven Schwartz","All right. And then one more on Health before I move to something else. The Health membership was down. It wasn't down last year in the fourth quarter, individual Health membership. This is not making sense to me.","Chris Pagano","A couple things. There's just a little bit of attrition that goes on during the course of every calendar year. And then more importantly, when we record sales in a quarter, the insureds [ph] do not go into the count until they pay their first premium. These are all Jan 1 effective dates, so the first-quarter, fourth-quarter lag is what you're going to see.","And then you will also see the effect in the first quarter of the fact that open enrollment continues on through February 15. So just a timing issue there.","Steven Schwartz","No, I get that. And that was explained last year, how there were the big sales and there wasn't that much growth in membership. But here was an actual decline which did not happen last year. Where did these people -- what products did they leave from and where did these people go? They didn't stay naked for a couple months.","Chris Pagano","Keep in mind, the other thing you got to remember first quarter of 2014, significant number of sales that offset the normal course attrition. And then there are other events. People who are unemployed find a new job, they go into a group plan, et cetera.","I think the volatility in this is really normal course. But again, the trend here is increased sales of individual medical in the metallic plans. And that's what you're going to see coming into play in 2015.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. Do these people leave? What plans did these people mostly leave from? Was it mostly the access health and they are going to healthcare.gov?","Chris Pagano","You know, we don't have that information, sorry.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. And then one more. The tablet loss in Specialty Property. I don't know a whole lot about this business, but I think of tablets, I think of Apple, I think of Samsung, I think of Microsoft, whoever. Is that the case here? And you said to a sister company, an affiliated company? Do they have captives that they are reinsuring this themselves? Is that what's is going on?","Alan Colberg","Yes, effectively. This was not competitive, which is the important point. And it's being moved to an affiliated insurance company of one of our former clients.","Steven Schwartz","Okay, so is this a trend? Do a lot of these companies have captives that can and will do this?","Alan Colberg","No, I think the reality has been over time the market is moving the other way. And you see that with the success of our mobile business. We have made real progress over the last few years. I think we've built a very strong franchise there.","Our pipeline of potential new clients is very robust. You do get into special circumstances occasionally, and that's what this was. But again at the end of the day, we feel good about the momentum in the mobile business and how it's going.","Steven Schwartz","Okay.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd","Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2019 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter 2019. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.","During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement.","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were strong, driven by continued momentum in our Global Lifestyle business, where earnings increased 35% year-over-year. Growth was mainly driven by mobile, which benefited from new and existing clients. We now support 52 million mobile subscribers, an increase of 18% year-over-year.","At the same time, we invested in our business to support the launch of new offerings and client programs, while expanding our infrastructure to support future growth. These investments which will continue into the fourth quarter will help sustain double-digit earnings expansion and strong cash flows long-term.","In the third quarter within Global Lifestyle, we launched a new partnership in Japan with Rakuten, a large e-commerce retailer. We're now providing mobile device protection for their existing and expanding mobile networks. Given our shared commitment to provide a superior customer experience, our offering also includes a fully digital claims experience and a rapid four hour mobile delivery service.","In the U.S., we renewed our 13-year partnership with DISH Network to continue to provide extended service contract protection for satellite receivers and set-top boxes. These partnerships are a testament to our differentiated capabilities since we made to strive more value to our partners and better experiences for their customers.","Our market success with new and long-term clients positions us well to play a key role in the connected living ecosystem, supporting mobile carriers, OEMs and cable and satellite operators. As we look to further enhance the customer experience, last week we announced our acquisition of CPR, a leading provider of local device repair services. With more than 700 franchise stores globally, this investment broadens our fulfillment options, providing customers increased choice through same-day repair options. Longer-term, we believe we can drive incremental revenue growth and operational efficiencies as we cross-sell protection programs and other services.","In global automotive, we remain focused on identifying opportunities to leverage our leadership position to scale in key global markets. In China, we recently refocused our operations to capitalize on the sizable auto opportunity, including the growing electric vehicle market. This includes a new partnership with the leading Chinese OEM focused solely on electric vehicles. This supports the expansion of our auto business globally, while also gaining further insights into the evolving electric vehicle market.","Overall, our offerings and new partnership support our Investor Day objectives for Global Lifestyle. We believe that we can grow net operating income in the segment by at least 10% on average from 2019 to 2021, and continue to produce strong cash flows.","Moving to Global Housing, I would like to start by thanking all of our employees who supported our policyholders during hurricane Dorian and tropical storm Imelda. As we preannounced, we incurred $36 million of after-tax losses mainly related to those events. Our relentless focus on customer service remains a competitive differentiator.","This quarter, within our lender placed business, we renewed another three client partnerships accounting for 3 million tracked loans. Looking at the past year, we\u2019ve now renewed client relationships representing more than half of our tracked loans, further solidifying the strength of our franchise. Overall for the segment, we're focused on continuing to deliver strong cash flows and better than market return on equity targeting between 17% to 20% return on equity with an average cat load. This will be supported by the expansion of our specially property offerings, including multifamily housing.","Turning to Global Preneed, we produced strong earnings excluding a one-time adjustment, which Richard will detail later. Preneed assets were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting growth in face sales. Additionally, we've seen [technical difficulty] just to a multi payer mix of business, which will further strengthen our ability to sustain solid returns and cash flows. We remain confident that we can deliver above market operating return equity of 13% long-term.","Looking at our key financial metrics in the first nine months of 2019, net operating income excluding catastrophes was up 17% to $435 million, mainly from TWG contributions, including realized synergies as well as significant organic growth. We also reported net operating earnings per share excluding catastrophes of $6.96, an increase of 9% year-over-year. This was driven by strong earnings growth, partially offset by the impact of shares issued last year for the TWG acquisition.","At the end of September, holding company liquidity totaled $385 million after returning $103 million to shareholders in the quarter. Through the end of the third quarter, we\u2019ve returned a total of $279 million to shareholders. Year-to-date, we're pleased with our progress against our 2019 commitments.","For the full-year, we still expect earnings-per-share growth between 6% to 10% compared to 2018. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our Investor Day objectives to expand earnings by double digits, drive strong cash flow and return $1.35 billion to shareholders through 2021.","The best is for that we deliver on these commitments, we're focused on a few critical multiyear priorities, our people, customer experience and innovation. Our people are and always will be central to our success. We will stay focused on finding ways to attract, retain and further develop our top talent and strengthen our culture around the world.","Customer experience remains a key competitive differentiator for our organization. Our focus will be on finding new ways whether through technology, new offerings or other means to raise the bar on the experience we create and deliver to end consumers. Doing so, will also result in deeper relationships with our key clients, particularly in global mobile, auto and multifamily housing. And lastly, innovation. We will put even greater emphasis on driving how we will innovate across our business to support the ever-connected lifestyle of consumers globally.","I will now turn the call over to Richard to review segment results and our 2019 outlook in greater detail. Richard?","A - Richard Dziadzio","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with Global Lifestyle. Segment reported earnings of $102 million for the third quarter, up $26 million year-over-year. As Alan noted, performance was driven by strong results in mobile, which reflected continued subscriber growth from carriers in Asia\/Pacific and North America, including the launch of Metro by T-Mobile in July. U.S., trade-in volumes also increased year-over-year and Europe benefited from better operating performance.","Global automotive, earnings were up $4 million, reflecting organic growth particularly in the U.S. Total revenue for the segment was up $208 million or 13%. The increase was driven by connected living growth, primarily in mobile expansion across our suite of offerings for carriers, OEMs and cable operators. To a lesser extent, we also saw growth through extended service contracts.","Auto revenue [technical difficulty] 4% relative to a strong quarter last year, both reflected prior period sales, international dealer and PPA channels. As we\u2019ve previously highlighted, we expect to accelerate investments to support growth, particularly in mobile in the fourth quarter, mainly reflecting initial program start up expenses for new clients and our strong pipeline. This should result in modestly lower earnings for lifestyle in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half, but in line with our original expectations.","Looking ahead to 2020, earnings expansion will moderate as we will grow up a much higher base in 2019, which benefited from a full-year TWG contributions. While growth may not be linear, we still expect earnings to increase at an average annual growth rate of 10% over the period '19 to 2021.","Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $42 million compared to $19 million in the third quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to $31 million of lower reportable catastrophes. Excluding reportable cats, earnings declined $9 million. This reflected lower income for lender placed, driven by year-over-year decline in placement rates and policies in force as well as a less favorable non-cat loss ratio.","Losses from our small commercial products improved from the first half of this year. In the quarter, we strengthened our reserves to account for recent loss trends and we will continue to monitor claims experience closely.","Turning to revenue, Global Housing net earned premiums and fees declined, reflecting the sale of mortgage solutions in August 2018. Excluding mortgage solutions, revenue grew modestly driven by our multifamily housing and specialty property businesses, partially offset by declines in lender-placed.","Looking at lender-placed in greater detail, the placement rate declined 6 basis points year-over-year and remained unchanged sequentially, consistent with the anticipated portfolio changes. Looking ahead, due to the insolvency, one of our clients we expect our tracked loan account to decline by approximately $600,000 over the next few quarters. This block of business represents approximately $70 million of annualized revenue and is expected to transition starting in the fourth quarter.","For Global Housing overall, we continue to expect net operating income for 2019 to be down modestly, excluding cat losses due to the elevated small commercial losses incurred this year. Lender-placed earnings excluding the higher cat reinsurance cost will likely be down slightly compared to 2018 rather than flat, once we take into account higher non-cat losses and the reduction in loans referenced earlier. We expect sustained growth in multifamily housing and expense management to partially mitigate the declines.","Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $7 million in net operating income, a $9 million year-over-year decrease. The decrease was driven by an error in the calculation of our deferred acquisition costs over a 10-year period. The chart was immaterial to any period, but aggregated to $10 million in the third quarter. Excluding the charge, earnings were up -- earnings were $17 million, up modestly from the prior period, driven by both higher income from real estate joint venture partnerships and increased assets.","Revenue in Preneed was up 6%, driven by continued growth in the U.S including strong sales of our Final Need product. We now expect Global Preneed's earnings to decline due to the one-time accounting adjustment. Excluding the adjustment, results would have trended in line with our original expectations for the year.","At corporate, the net operating loss was $21 million, up $2 million compared to the prior year period. This was a result of lower tax rate due to the net loss in the quarter. The net loss was primarily driven by investment in Ik\u00e9 Asistencia. For the full year 2019, we still expect to approximate 2018 levels or roughly $85 million.","As we announced in May, we began a process to explore strategic options for Ik\u00e9. In the quarter, we recorded a $125 million charge to net income, reflecting our intent to sell the asset. The charges based on the current estimated value of our 40% ownership interest, the value of our put call option and the cumulative foreign-currency losses. However, as the process is ongoing, there can be no guarantees that we will ultimately conclude a sale.","Turning to the holding company liquidity, we ended September with $385 million or about $160 million above our current minimum target level of $225 million. Dividends in the quarter from our operating segments totaled $217 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, the outflows included $65 million in share repurchases, $42 million in common and preferred dividends and $28 million mainly related to a contingent payment for a block of flood policies acquired in 2016.","In the quarter, we also had cash outflows of $39 million related to expenses from refinancing debt at a lower interest rate. We are pleased, we were able to secure new 10-year senior notes and attractive coupon, lowering our overall interest costs to approximately $80 million after tax on an annualized basis, while lengthening the maturity of our borrowings.","For the full-year 2019, we expect dividends from our operating segments to approximate segment operating earnings. We brought up nearly 90% of segment net operating earnings as dividends to the holding company through the first nine months of the year. Overall, these dividend should provide flexibility to invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders -- market conditions.","In summary, we\u2019ve demonstrated strong performance in the quarter. We remain focused on delivering profitable growth and meeting our financial commitments for 2019 to service a stronger foundation for 2020 and beyond.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey. Good morning, Mark.","Mark Hughes","Good morning, Alan. Good morning, Richard. Richard, you would talk about the guidance. Both of you did the 10% annual growth between 2019 and 2021. Could you make a commentary about 2020 in the course of that?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, Mark. So as we will always do and have done in our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we will provide a lot more granularity on how we think about 2020. But we're still very confident in the view that we provided back at Investor Day of on average annual growth of 10% plus for lifestyle, 12% plus for EPS. The challenge in 2020 for lifestyle is we\u2019ve had such a strong growth in 2019 that we have a much higher base and we had a full-year of the TWG synergies, that\u2019s going to make it just harder to sustain that level of growth in 2020. But the business is well positioned and we feel our franchises are strong.","Mark Hughes","Your point is that it will be hard to sustain this level of growth, but you still feel confidence in the guidance that you provided? Is that fair?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. Yes, Mark, that\u2019s correct.","Mark Hughes","Okay. And then the -- from a TWG perspective, I think your outlook for costs you said that the cost efficiencies you set at the higher end of the range [technical difficulty], anything more -- any other opportunities you see on a go forward basis either from a [technical difficulty] cost efficiencies, the efficiency of your repair network that we might anticipate?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, I think if we step back, we feel very good about the TWG acquisition and the integration. As we said earlier this year, we've achieved our synergy commitment publicly ahead of plan. With that said, we continue to look for growth opportunities. I think I mentioned on the call about our new partnership in China this quarter on electric vehicles. We would never have achieved that without the warranty group. And so over time, we are going to look for other opportunities like that that will enable us to grow revenue not just improve their profitability. So I think we are well positioned and at this point we\u2019re a global market leader in auto and we are trying to leverage that scale everywhere we can.","Mark Hughes","And then, last question on the lender-placed business. You held steady in terms of placement rate. The placement rates in the last couple of quarters I think there has been some mix that\u2019s influenced that. Can you talk about on an underlying basis, it seems like some of the data at least on early delinquencies is suggesting an uptick. And I wonder whether you are seeing any impact of that or what\u2019s the normal timing where you would see an impact on your [technical difficulty] rates, if early stage delinquencies are starting to move up?","Alan Colberg","Yes, I think it's fair to say we are not really seeing anything in our business at the moment. The reality is in that business, it is a big countercyclical hedge. We don't tend to place until it's later in the cycle. The loan has moved into serious delinquency foreclosure. So if there is any slowdown starting to happen, that will benefit us later.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","John Nadel with UBS. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning, John.","Richard Dziadzio","Good morning, John.","John Nadel","Thanks. Good morning, Alan. Good morning, Richard. So I think this is the first quarter that the year-over-year comparison within lifestyle is fully inclusive in both periods of the warranty group, correct? So the revenue growth, I think ex-currency the 14%, 14.5% year-over-year. Is that Alan, is you think about 2020? Is that the piece of the growth rate where you say, probably a little bit more challenging to sustain that on a year-over-year basis, and therefore that growth rate maybe slows down and that's the reason why earnings growth slows down, or is it really just the fact that you\u2019ve got such a faster pace of earnings growth in 2019 owing to things that you mentioned like the expense synergies?","Alan Colberg","Yes. John, I appreciate the question. So the challenge with revenue as we\u2019ve talked about in prior quarters, if we change the contract structure which happens often with our clients, our revenue could go down, or go up, but it's -- has really no effect on our earnings. So we tend to focus much more on the NOI in that business. And the \u2026","John Nadel","Got you.","Alan Colberg","\u2026 as I mentioned, we\u2019ve had such strong growth this year, we\u2019ve a full-year of the warrant group synergies. It's hard to build off of that at the same level that we\u2019ve grown in 2019. We also -- we mentioned several new clients on this call. We\u2019ve others, we didn't mention on the call, we're continuing to invest and our pipeline remains very robust for global lifestyle overall.","John Nadel","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I just want to think in terms of order of magnitude, last quarter you guys appropriately sort of gave us some help unexpecting that Lifestyle earnings in the back half of '19 would be down modestly from the front half of '19. As we look -- as you look at the third quarter [technical difficulty] of lifestyle, is that -- was there anything that was sort of [technical difficulty] with your expectation there? Was that in line, because that means that\u2019s a pretty modest, I mean that is definitely a modest year-over-year decline. Should you -- I guess, I know you don\u2019t want to give guidance for any single quarter, but is that the kind of pace of decline that\u2019s -- that we should expect and as we look forward to the fourth quarter?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, I will take that. Hey, John. I think as we looked at it, we came into the first half of the year, we basically are looking at half years together. So we're looking first half, second half and signal that we thought the second half would be lower than the first half. I think as we sit here at the end of the third quarter and looking at the second half, it really is coming in line with our expectations. I think we've seen some, the trade-ins, some of the trade-in volumes go down as we had anticipated given the strong first half of the year we had. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen strong growth in Asia\/Pacific, the U.S., improved profitability in Europe, which we had been planning on to. So, overall, we are in line with our expectations as Alan said in his opening statements.","John Nadel","Okay. And then I just had one more, and it just escape me so I will re-queue.","Alan Colberg","All right. Thanks, John.","Richard Dziadzio","Thanks, John.","John Nadel","Thanks.","Operator","Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning.","Michael Phillips","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. I guess another crack at that, the prior question with 4Q. If we look at your guidance for this year, you are kind of a little bit above the midpoint right now. And I guess if we couple that with your -- the last comment two half being a little bit less than one half. Is -- and you don\u2019t give, I guess I don\u2019t see the extra incremental expenses that you\u2019re putting into mobile on a quarterly basis on what you did this quarter. But should we expect the amount of investment expense in the fourth quarter to be accelerated from third quarter? Now from what you did or headline to third quarter? And I ask that to think about kind of how we\u2019re -- how we\u2019re thinking about that range of 6% to 10%, given where you already are today and what the expense might be in the fourth quarter?","Alan Colberg","I think it's fair to say in the fourth quarter we are going to have accelerated investment. We are very encouraged by the new clients that we're ramping in the pipeline and we're investing to deliver future growth and profitability. So, yes.","Michael Phillips","Just to clarify, when you say accelerated, you mean on top of not just first half, but in top of third quarter as well, correct?","Alan Colberg","Yes. And \u2026","Michael Phillips","Okay.","Richard Dziadzio","\u2026 in addition to that, when you say the 6%to 10%, you\u2019re really talking about Assurant overall EPS.","Michael Phillips","I am. That\u2019s correct. Yes.","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, and we\u2019ve talked about small commercial been out there, some continued declines in financial services. So there are a couple of headwinds that we are taking into account when we're given that range to you.","Michael Phillips","Okay. Okay. Thank you. I guess just two kind of smaller ones, real quickly. You\u2019ve mentioned growth -- the mobile growth, specifically in Europe, was strong. And can you talk about maybe what\u2019s kind of driving that?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So, mobile growth has been strong in all regions in Asia\/Pacific, especially Japan, it's really new clients and new programs. In Europe, it's really been a couple of things. We\u2019ve leveraged our global supply chain capability out of the U.S to really strengthen our supply chain in Europe, and that's been a big driver. We've also been very disappointed with expenses, which has helped NOI growth. But we're encouraged, we're seeing strong growth and in fact with all regions of the world in mobile.","Michael Phillips","Okay. And then just lastly, this one doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention, but in lifestyle the Global Financial products, I mean decline there was kind of more than expected at least from -- expected for me. Any numbers in the quarter there and then kind of the margins continue to slip a little bit there. So any kind of color on that segment?","Alan Colberg","I think what we\u2019ve said before, Mike is that the segment that line of business is in runoff domestically. There's probably a little bit [indiscernible] going on in there as well. So, yes, it was down in the quarter. You\u2019re right.","Michael Phillips","Okay. We\u2019ve kind of -- yes, sure. All right. Thank you.","Alan Colberg","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Christopher Campbell with KBW. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey. Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Campbell","Hi. Good morning.","Richard Dziadzio","Good morning.","Christopher Campbell","I guess the first question on the Global Housing. The guidance declined there. I think last quarter you guys have said that it was -- you thought like the loans tracked would be like, I guess, relatively like [technical difficulty]. I guess kind of what changed the guidance this time?","Alan Colberg","Yes. Well -- Yes. Thanks, Chris. I guess, one of the things that we pointed out in the opening remarks I think is part of the need for the change, which is the insolvency of one of our clients and we see those loans transitioning away in the fourth quarter, that will have an impact on us. And we've also seen year-over-year, a small increase, but an increase in the non-cat loss ratio. So we're taking those two factors into account, the kind of change in the outlook and say before we had said that it would be flat, now we\u2019re saying it will be down a bit.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, got it. So it's -- okay, so what we\u2019re seeing this quarter is not related to the loans that the competitor picked up, but these are like additional loans that were a client in solvency. Is that the way to think of it?","Alan Colberg","Yes, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, Chris.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. Okay, great. And then CPR, I mean, it sounds like it's small. Is there going to be any revenue or EBITDA impact from that, that we should be modeling in?","Richard Dziadzio","The way to think about CPR is we\u2019re in the business of delivering superior customer experiences and the way its evolving is our traditional people model, the big facilities works really well for buyback and trade-in and that\u2019s going to continue to be a very important driver. But increasingly consumers are asking for same day same-store type repair. CPR gives us that capability. So over time, it'll be potentially significant growth driver for us, but it's going to take us time to integrate it, building into our offerings, get our clients to offer it. We're excited. It gives us the capability to deliver yet another really superior customer experience.","Christopher Campbell","Got it. And should we be thinking about incremental investment costs as you try to kind of unlock the synergies for that, that are -- that could impact Lifestyle segment?","Alan Colberg","Nothing more than we\u2019ve already talked about. We expect to accelerate investments in Q4, but that alone is not going to be a big driver of it.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. Great. And then you reviewed the Ike stake this time and took the charge. I mean, are there any other underperforming areas that you're kind of looking at across the portfolio of products that you're looking to prune to improve results?","Alan Colberg","So, we go through a regular process with our Board, looking at everything we are doing and discussing whether we feel like it's still strategic or not. Ike, interesting company when we made that investment six years ago, now it was really about growing to scale in Latin America with additional fee-based offerings. Over the last six years, our strong growth in LACTAM and then the warranty group acquisition, we now have a much stronger franchise in Latin America, which is what led us to take the opportunity to reevaluate, it doesn't fit as well as it did six years ago. So we will continue to look for things. I think we feel very good about our portfolio at this point. You've also seen us be over the years very disciplined stewards of the capital of our shareholders and we will continue that as we go forward.","Christopher Campbell","Got it. And then just kind of unpacking the charge [technical difficulty] bunch of it was FX and part of it was derivatives. So I guess, was there like an underlying -- I mean, was the marks like all attributable to that, or has the value of the Ike franchise been materially impaired over the last few years?","Alan Colberg","I think that we can break the charge down into a couple of things, total charge being a $125 million. The first thing is as you pointed out, Chris, was $41 million is really related to the cumulative change in FX or the FX loss, I would say, the weakening of the peso since our acquisition some five years ago, that's $41 million. The other $84 million, four of it was a deferred tax asset that we took down. And then the other $80 million is really the difference between what we have up on our books for our 40% interest and that the 60% interest obligation we have to buy the rest the 60% and the market value, should we sell the company? And again, as I said in my opening comments, we are in the process, we had advanced in the process, but we can't say today that we will conclude the process. So, still always to go there and we will keep everyone up to date as we always do.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. Wonderful. Thanks for all the answers. Best of luck in the fourth quarter.","Richard Dziadzio","Okay.","Alan Colberg","All right. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey. Good morning, Gary.","Richard Dziadzio","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Ransom","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the Ike charge too. Just when I look back at 5-years ago, you put in $110 million and probably a lot of things happened in between and now there's a $125 charge. I assume there was some marking up along the way and I just wondered if you could help me rationalize the beginning and end of the two pieces.","Alan Colberg","Sure. Sure. I think, first of all, when just to level set everyone, we talk about a $110 million that was for the 40% interest that we had during the course of the time. We haven\u2019t marked up the asset. We\u2019ve kept it on the books, obviously through time we've gotten an income from the assets. There have been dividends out from the assets. So that changed the book value. And really what we're coming to now is after five years and during that five year period, there actually has been a pretty good weakening of the Mexican peso to the U.S dollar, $40 million, that\u2019s a third of the charge. The other two thirds really, one is -- one part is based on the 40 percentages we have and the book value we have today and our expectations of sale price for that. And then the others on the 60%, we actually have a call put that we\u2019ve talked about in the past and that's had a formula. So we are looking at that the market value that we could have in the sale versus what that formula gives us, and that's the other part of the markdown.","Richard Dziadzio","And Gary, the only thing I would add is when you look at the Ike franchise, it remains strong. And that's why we've had a process ongoing that we'll see where we end up. But it is a good company just for us as we think about where best to deploy our capital. It's not a 100%. Certainly, that\u2019s the best thing we should do.","Gary Ransom","Okay. So in other words, part of the charge really relates to the 60% you didn't actually buy yet, that\u2019s feeding through this put call option?","Alan Colberg","Yes.","Gary Ransom","Okay.","Alan Colberg","That\u2019s exactly right. I mean, we obviously we have that -- we call it an option to put call option, right? So, more and more less an obligation to purchase it. So as we\u2019ve gone on and said, okay, now we\u2019re in the sales process, that giving us visibility in terms of potential pricing. So we take into account what that is versus what we would sell it for. Net difference, we\u2019ve put up in the book, so putting it at our best estimate today.","Gary Ransom","And that\u2019s been mark-to-market every year along the way? I mean, maybe not as thoroughly thinking about it and intent to sell, I realize that. Is that a -- that had a value in there, although.","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. Well you just hit the nail on the head, Gary. I mean, really we've been holding it until the third quarter as an operating entity with the operations, since Alan said it's performed fairly well during our period of shift. It's really in this third quarter that we\u2019ve said we've advanced in a process. Now we have an intent to sell what's the sales price and obviously we're in -- we're talking about in Mexico in today and the environment and climate etcetera. So we take all of that into account in the current estimate.","Gary Ransom","And just one thing to make clear. This has no effect on your buyback and capital return, correct?","Richard Dziadzio","Well, I would say if anything it could potentially be a net positive, because it could give us excess capital if we sell it. Because remember we\u2019ve taken into account in our Investor Day that we would hold it. So it would give us excess cash and then we\u2019d see what we would do with that excess capital as we go forward, either return or hold it.","Alan Colberg","Yes, Gary, the one thing I would add is, we remain committed to our expectation of returning $1.35 billion to shareholders in 2021. As Richard said, if we do end up ultimately with excess capital, you've seen our track record of returning it. But at this point, it's too early to say anything other than we are still committed to our $1.35 billion through 2021.","Gary Ransom","All right. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. I think I\u2019ve got it now. I wanted to go to one other topic on mobile, okay? And just as you talk about, all of the flow of business, it\u2019s the pipeline. And I think we all know there's a delay in how you invest and you launch the program and then you still have certain customers starting to pay and it builds up over time. And I've -- I\u2019m just trying to think of the timing, if you have things in the pipeline, if some of this actually going beyond our '19 to '21 window? Are we actually setting up -- I know we keep talking about out through '21. But when I think about the timing, it feels like today's pipeline is actually partly beyond 2021. Is that true? Can you give us a feel of that, the timing of all of those things?","Alan Colberg","Gary, that\u2019s absolutely correct when you think about it. So if you think about a new client that we are launching this quarter, we start generally with no customers. We have to invest, integrate into their systems to develop the marketing materials to train people etcetera. And generally within a year or so, we start to turn profitable. It generally takes 3 to 4 years for those programs to kind of reach maturity. So a program we are launching today probably doesn't reach maturity until 2022, 2023. And then the pipeline client, we may close on next year or the year after, but we\u2019re making investments to perceive to set that up for the future. CPR is another example of something that will benefit us beyond the '21 period. The last thing I would say is, if you look at the eventual 5G wave that's going to come, we didn't reflect that anywhere in the '20 or '21 outlook because we think it's going to take a little while. But there's a whole wave of 5G activity coming in the out years for mobile.","Gary Ransom","Okay. Well, that's helpful. Thank you very much.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Richard Dziadzio","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] John Nadel with UBS. Your line is open.","Richard Dziadzio","Hey, John.","John Nadel","Hey, I think I'm recovering from a senior moment. So kind of along the same lines as Gary's question and I'll be a bit more specific. And I think you already gave a little bit of color, but maybe you can give a little bit more. So if you isolated on a single new client, I guess, particularly with Connected Living. How do we think about the sort of order of magnitude size of the upfront investment spending versus the later in time ramp up in revenue? And then breakeven period versus the sort of achieving targeted margin, if you will. Is there a way to break that down for us and give us a decent sense?","Richard Dziadzio","It's hard to generalize, because as we\u2019ve talked about in Investor Day and since then our programs could have anywhere between 1 and 7 products in services. And so the amount of investment will vary based on that. But all of those are priced to over a period of time to generate a very attractive IRR for our shareholders. So I think we feel good about these new programs that we're launching and ramping. You can see the benefit and the growth in mobile over time. That's resulted from the prior programs that we\u2019ve launched.","John Nadel","Yes, no question. And I think you mentioned in response to Gary, you talked about roughly 1-year time frame to the point where you actually start to turn profitable on a new client. Is that about -- is that a reasonable way for us to think about it?","Richard Dziadzio","I think it's fair. I mean, I generalize it with some risk to it because every program is still [indiscernible] is fair that it takes a period of time and where the economics really start to flow through is when you get out into year two and three and the programs begin to get closer to maturity.","John Nadel","Is it a good example of that right now, KDDI?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. Yes, we launched that originally in late 2017. We are now heading into year three of that program.","John Nadel","All right. Terrific. And then, Richard, just a housekeeping item. On a year-to-date basis through the end of September, what's your after-tax loss from the small commercial business? And also, are you on track to effectively non renew the vast majority of that business by the end of the year? So very little, if any, contribution into 2020?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, I will start by the second part, the answer is yes. We are -- as we\u2019ve talked about before, John, we're kind of unwinding unplugging that business. So every quarter now the net earned premium obviously what we've written in the past and what\u2019s earning out today is decreasing quite substantially. The first intensive first part of your question that we said in a previous call, first two quarters of the year, we were -- we lost about $6 million each quarter. This quarter, the portfolio performed better, think about a couple of million dollars loss with that in this last quarter and that represents [indiscernible].","John Nadel","And do you think fourth quarter would be -- do you think fourth quarter will be more similar to the first half of the year, or more similar to the third? Any -- or any sense there?","Richard Dziadzio","Well, the business is -- the portfolio was getting smaller, right?","John Nadel","Shrinking?","Richard Dziadzio","So, one would hope that the experience would mimic that. On the other hand, who knows there's some property, some liability, what we could have some higher losses within that. So it will -- to be seen, but we are winding it down and its winding down very quickly.","John Nadel","So probably fair to estimate that for the full-year '19, somewhere between $15 million and $20 million, probably closer to the $15 million ex loss contribution that -- almost all of that or maybe all of that would not recur in 2020?","Alan Colberg","Yes. John what I would say is, we are winding that business down quickly. We are cautiously optimistic that most of the losses are behind us. I wouldn't give a number for the year. But as I look at 2020, we obviously feel good about that that this business will largely be behind us. We will have a benefit in 2020, because its largely behind us. We will have some offset in housing in 2020 from that transition of loans away from the insolvent client. But in terms of the small commercial -- hopefully it's largely behind us at this point.","John Nadel","Yes, understood. Thank you so much.","Richard Dziadzio","Okay. Thanks, John.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey, Mark.","Richard Dziadzio","Hi, Mark.","Mark Hughes","Yes. The taxes in the lifestyle business, if I\u2019m looking at it probably have been bringing about a point per quarter, 24%, 23%, 22% is a good go forward tax rate for the global lifestyle business?","Alan Colberg","It's in that range. I think we\u2019ve said it's around 22% to 24%, overall. And it really is just reflecting the profitability of our business geographically and the tax rates in those various geographies.","Mark Hughes","Okay. And then the placement rate on the 600,000 loans that you\u2019re going to be losing from the insolvent client. Did you give some indication of what -- whether those are above average, below average?","Alan Colberg","In terms of the loans, we talked about 600,000 and really revenues pegged a placement rate, but really the revenue is about $70 million in annualized NEP coming out of this [indiscernible].","Mark Hughes","Okay. And then, Alan, you mentioned the 5G wave. And you anticipate that coming in the future could -- just give us as you look at the opportunity for Assurant, how do you kind of frame that up in your mind? And who knows exactly when or the pace of it, but what should it mean for your business?","Alan Colberg","If you think about 5G from a consumer point of view, when it ultimately rolls out, it dramatically improves latency, which creates all sorts of new applications including autonomous vehicles really being driven by that, which is [technical difficulty] since we made the investment in auto. The timing, nobody really knows. But what it will cause is over a period of a couple of years, you will see probably a big spike in handset activity, which would benefit us. So, again, I don\u2019t think this is in the 2021 type time frame. But longer term we are trying to set up the business to be well positioned for that wave.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Alan Colberg","Right. Thanks. Thanks everyone for participating in today's call. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance and believe we\u2019re well positioned to meet our financial objectives for the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress, on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. In the meantime, please reach out to Suzanne Shepherd and Sean Mosher with any follow-up questions.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd","Thank you, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2019 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the second quarter 2019. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.","During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement.","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results surpassed our expectations as mobile benefited from increasing customer demand for our differentiated offerings. Global Lifestyle's strong performance more than offset elevated non-catastrophe loss experienced in Global Housing and modestly higher corporate expenses. This quarter, we continued to leverage our market-leading positions and deep consumer insights to deliver value for customers along with double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flows.","In Global Lifestyle, we were pleased to see earnings up 33% organically as connected living earnings nearly doubled in the quarter. New programs and client partnerships implemented over the last two years continue to ramp up, driving an 11% increase in covered mobile devices year-over-year. We now support over 48 million mobile customers globally.","Overall, mobile has been a strong performer. Since the fourth quarter of 2017, we brought on eight new partners accounting for almost seven million covered mobile devices and have expanded several relationships through additional offerings. We have multiple new opportunities on the horizon which bodes well for our continued growth, but will require increased investments, which Richard will discuss later.","Also within connected living, we officially launched Metro by T-Mobile's premium handset protection on July 1. Starting in the third quarter, this will add several million subscribers to our mobile device count and once fully implemented will make us the exclusive provider of device protection to all T-Mobile customers.","Turning to The Warranty Group. We're very pleased to have delivered on our operating synergy of $60 million pre-tax on a run rate basis for the acquisition. This milestone comes two quarters ahead of schedule, as we have moved swiftly to integrate the business over the last year, optimizing our global operations, while strengthening our client relationships.","In Global Housing, we saw continued success in multi-family housing as we grew within both our affinity and P&C partners and benefited from higher penetration rates to our new point of lease billing and tracking platform. The implementation of our enhanced integrators-renters platform progressed with over 20 clients now active.","We've also expanded existing relationships with several of the largest property management companies in the U.S. through our differentiated offerings. In the quarter, we further strengthened our leading lender-placed franchise by renewing several more partnerships including three of the top 10 mortgage servicers in the U.S. With our focus on operational excellence and the customer experience, we made good progress on the rollout of our dynamic claims fulfillment across all Global Housing lines of business. This expedites claims adjudication by reducing time to review and pay claims as well as simplifying the overall customer experience. The quarter was also characterized by higher non-catastrophe weather losses, a trend seen across the industry.","In addition, these weather trends and overall elevated claims in our small commercial products lowered housing results. We believe these higher claims and small commercial could continue throughout 2019 and we've adjusted our outlook for housing accordingly. Our long-term view of the business remains unchanged, and we believe we will generate a 17% to 20% operating ROE, including an average expected cat load.","Turning to Global Preneed, we produced strong earnings as we generated solid returns and cash flows. Base sales had another all-time high of $273 million, benefiting from the expansion of new distribution partners. This gives us confidence that we can sustain an above-market operating ROE of 13% in Global Preneed over the long term.","Looking at overall Assurant results for the first half of 2019, we reported net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes of $4.62, an increase of 9% from the first half of 2018. This was driven by strong earnings growth, partially offset by the impact of shares issued last year related to our TWG acquisition.","Net operating income, also excluding catastrophes, was up 25% to $293 million, mainly from TWG contributions including realized synergies as well as significant organic mobile growth. At the end of June, holding company liquidity totaled $386 million after returning $88 million to shareholders.","For the full year 2019, we continue to expect double-digit earnings growth as well as operating earnings per share to increase 6% to 10%. This compares to the $8.65 we reported in 2018. Significant profitable growth in mobile continued earnings expansion in auto and multifamily housing, as well as disciplined capital deployment will be key drivers.","Strong performance in Global Lifestyle, even after including the increased investments to support growth should help offset the higher non-cat claims in Global Housing. Overall, we believe we will deliver strong results in 2019 with an attractive business portfolio that should continue to produce more diversified higher-quality earnings.","This will allow us to continue making investments to accelerate our innovation for the connected consumer, improve the customer experience and sustain our track record of returning excess capital to shareholders over the long-term.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review segment results and our 2019 outlook in greater detail. Richard?","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported record earnings of $109 million for the second quarter, up $41 million year-over-year. The increase reflects an additional $22 million of income from TWG, compared to only one month of earnings recorded in the prior-year period. Overall, TWG results for this quarter included $3 million of intangible amortization and $11 million of realized expense synergies, bringing the total realized synergies to $35 million after tax since the acquisition closed.","Excluding TWG, Global Lifestyle results were up 33%, which was primarily driven by an impressive $25 million increase in Connected Living year-over-year. Mobile benefited from an increase in subscribers in both Asia Pacific and North America led by growth in our carrier OEM and cable operator distribution channels.","In addition, operating performance in Europe was a driver with strong underwriting results. In Global Automotive, excluding TWG earnings were down modestly year-over-year due to increased investments to support growth and new offerings. Keep in mind, that the second quarter of 2018 included $2 million one-time benefit.","Looking at total revenue for the segment, net earned premiums and fees were up $707 million mainly from the $481 million of additional revenue from TWG. Excluding TWG, revenue was up $226 million or 25%. This was a reflection of the many mobile programs launched during the past two years.","Auto revenue, excluding TWG was up 17%, benefiting from strong prior period sales, international dealer and PPA distribution channels. Looking ahead, and as Alan noted, we expect additional mobile and auto investments in the third and fourth quarters associated with IT enhancements and program implementations to support our continued growth and new opportunities.","In addition to typical seasonal patterns, mainly increased mobile loss ratios and the impact of new program launches these additional investments are expected to result in modestly lower earnings for lifestyle in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half. Overall, for the full year, we still expect significant earnings growth and we'll have a stronger foundation to maintain our momentum into 2020.","Moving to Global Housing: Net operating income for the quarter totaled $72 million down $1 million from the second quarter of 2018. Both periods benefited from the absence of meaningful reportable catastrophes. Excluding reportable catastrophes, earnings declined $3 million.","Growth in multifamily housing was more than offset by less favorable non-catastrophe losses in small commercial products and expected higher reinsurance costs. Second quarter last year also included losses from the mortgage solution business prior to the sale in the third quarter.","Looking specifically at small commercial, we had several large claims and an overall increase in frequency, which we believe could continue. We have made the decision to exit the business and have begun the process of exiting the portfolio.","Global Housing revenue declined reflecting the sale of mortgage solutions. Excluding mortgage solutions, revenue grew 4% due to the growth in both our specialty portfolio and our multifamily housing business.","The placement rate was unchanged from the first quarter this year as we on-boarded a new portfolio of loans with a higher placement rate. Without this small block the placement rate would have declined more in line with our expectations or about two or three basis points.","In addition, one of our lender-placed clients has decided to transfer their portfolio to another provider, reducing our loans tracked by approximately $2 million in the third quarter. These loans have a much lower-than-average placement rate and policies will transition off at renewal. The net effect of these two portfolio changes is expected to be neutral to our financial results over the next several quarters.","As Alan noted, we now expect Global Housing net operating income for 2019 to be down modestly, excluding cat losses, due to the elevated small commercial claims. We continue to expect lender-placed to be stable excluding the higher cat costs. And we are pleased to see the sustained growth in multifamily housing, which should partially offset the decline.","Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded another strong quarter $17 million in net operating income. The $2 million year-over-year increase was driven by higher net investment income as asset levels increase from continued growth in this business as well as the move toward a more profitable sales mix.","Revenue in Preneed was up 6%, driven mainly by growth in the U.S. including sales of our Final Need product. Global Preneed's outlook for the year remains unchanged with earnings roughly flat with 2018, as we continue to manage expenses closely and look to grow long-term from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings.","At Corporate, the net operating loss was $24 million, a $7 million increase compared to the prior year period. This was attributable to reduced investment income, a result of lower investable assets in comparison to the second quarter of last year. Higher employee-related expenses and third-party professional fees to support growth also drove an increase in the quarterly loss. We continue to expect the corporate loss to approximate 2018 levels or roughly $85 million.","Turning to capital, we ended March with $386 million in holding company liquidity or about $161 million above our current minimum target level of $225 million. Dividends in the quarter from our operating segments totaled $177 million. In addition to our quarterly Corporate, and interest expenses key outflows included $50 million in share repurchases $43 million in common and preferred dividends, and $8 million mainly in mobile technology capabilities as part of our venture capital program.","In the third quarter through August 2, we repurchased an additional 168,000 shares for $19 million. For full year 2019, we expect dividends from our operating segments to approximate segment operating earnings. We brought up 66% of segment net operating earnings as dividends to the holding company through the first half of the year. This aligns with our historical pattern. Overall, the dividend should provide flexibility to invest in our businesses and return character shareholders subject to market conditions.","In summary, we demonstrated strong first half performance and remain focused on delivering profitable growth and meeting our financial commitments for 2019.","And with that operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Mark Hughes","Hey good morning. A couple of questions. Your Global Housing expense ratio really dropped year-over-year. Could you talk about the drivers on that? I know you've had some expense initiatives that you've been working on. Is that mix? Will that decline continue?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, good morning, Mark, it's Richard. Yes, I think a couple of things are going on to improve the expense ratio. I mean, I think the first thing is last year obviously as mentioned in our comments we had mortgage solutions that was weighing down a little bit that ratio. I think secondly, there are some good expense initiatives going on in the housing area, that are bringing that down. And third, we have multifamily housing that's continuing to grow as well. So a couple of things there that are all helping expense ratio to be at that level.","Mark Hughes","When we think about that -- the Global Lifestyle growth of 25% obviously quite strong and that's -- that growth rate doubled compared to last quarter. When we think about kind of the puts and takes the new business coming online may be lapping some of that new business from last year, is there any reason why third quarter growth should be demonstrably slower, faster? Just thinking in terms of as I say as you've been bringing new customers online, is there -- the timing how much does that impact the second half growth outlook?","Alan Colberg","Yes Mark. No first of all, I think we're very proud of our team in Global Lifestyle and the strong results they're delivering. Let me separate kind of revenue from NOI. So, if you think about revenue, we are continuing to ramp the programs that were launched in the last 18 months. So, we're going to add subscribers. Those programs are going to continue to grow and that should continue in Q3 and beyond. If you think about the second half of the year though when you go to NOI, we do have some seasonality that tends to play out with causing the second half of the year in recent years to be below the first half in mobile even with the growth.","And that seasonality really is around a few things. One is, we think about when new phones are launched, the last few years those launches have been later in the cycle and often availability not really there until early the next year which has pushed some of the growth into Q1. The second thing we see is when we launch new clients and new programs, they normally launch in Q3 or early Q4 around the NPI. So that's also something we have to invest -- every time we launch those new programs, we have to invest in technology, we have to do the training, we have to do the integration.","And then just in Q3, we normally have some seasonality in the underwriting results. People are outside more they drop their phones, they get them wet. So I think, we'll -- we expect to continue to have strong growth over time in lifestyle. You'll see it probably in revenue in Q3. We expect NOI will be down modestly in the second half than the first half.","Mark Hughes","And then just a longer-term question, your growth has been so strong in the Connected Living. When we think about returns in the lifestyle segment, I think most of the capital as I understand it is there to support the auto business. If you continue to get growth in Connected Living, how much sensitivity is there in terms of returns? Should we see those returns improve as the mix becomes less capital intensive? And is there any way to throw any sort of numbers or relative guidance at that idea?","Richard Dziadzio","Sure. It's Richard, again. So I see a couple -- it's a great question. I think a couple of things in there. I think, first of all, going back to Investor Day when we look at lifestyle, we're not really as much looking at returns as we are in growth really net income growth in the area. And as you can see we just really had a fantastic first half of the year. So I think that's sort of the first thing I would say.","And just in terms of capital, I think, you're exactly right. I mean auto has taken a little more capital than Connected Living, albeit auto is I would consider a bit capital light too given the arrangements that we have and the structures that we're -- that we have. So overall, I think, as we look at Assurant as an enterprise, we are going to a less capital-intensive environment as time goes on. So overall the returns of Assurant should be increasing. We talked about going -- overall ROE going up a couple hundred bps over the next few years.","Mark Hughes","I will get back in queue. Thank you. ","Richard Dziadzio","Thanks, Mark.","Alan Colberg","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS. Please go ahead. ","Alan Colberg","Good morning, John.","Richard Dziadzio","Hey, good morning, John.","John Nadel","Hey. Good morning, Alan. Good morning, Richard. Maybe just to start on housing, can you quantify for us -- I think you've quantified for us the small commercial business is about -- maybe 15% of the specialty and other premiums fees and other income. Is that accurate?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. That's a good range, yes.","John Nadel","And so against what looks like maybe, I don't know a $75 million kind of run rate of revenue how much in operating loss did that particular business generate whether it's in -- whether you want to refer to the second quarter or maybe even eve the first half of the year?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. So yes, I mean, we did talk about the small commercial product and that's a couple of things it's property and its liability. And as we said in our statements last time and this time it did produced some losses for us and we are exiting the business. So I think we've taken some good actions, management actions to rectify that. In terms of the quantification -- Q2, Q1 we are right around $6 million each quarter I would say in terms of loss added to the bottom line.","Alan Colberg","Yes. And John...","John Nadel","Got it. So after tax loss in each quarter was roughly similar and about $12 million on a year-to-date basis?","Richard Dziadzio","That's right, John.","John Nadel","Okay. Perfect.","Alan Colberg","Yes. And John in terms of housing -- let me just make one other comment on housing. If you put aside the small commercial which was an experiment in growth that we quickly shutdown when it didn't perform as expected we feel very good about how the balance of housing is performing. Multifamily is continuing to grow. We're still early in the rollout of our point of lease, but that looks very promising for driving penetration. And lender-placed is performing as expected. So we feel generally very encouraged about housing other than the challenges we had with small commercial and elevated non-cat overall.","John Nadel","Yes. No that's what I'm trying to get that by sort of stripping away the small commercial business, which obviously I agree with your decision to get out of that business at this point. So it does look like housing underneath that or ex that is performing well. The -- if I can move over to Global lifestyle then. I just want to understand the pace of earnings or the pattern of earnings.","Your revenue growth is much stronger than I think just about anybody has been expecting certainly I can speak for myself. But if earnings are going to be down a little bit in the second half relative to the first half, I guess, I can understand why margin would be down. But given how fast revenues are growing is it -- should we really expect that earnings are going to decline, or just that margin will decline?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. I think there's a couple of things in there again John. Good question. I think as we look at it and as we talked about before I think we have to be very careful in looking at the margin of the lifestyle business because of the -- I would say the differences or nuances in the accounting.","For example in Q2 there was a contract change with one client that had no impact really on bottom-line, but more revenues coming on top line. So there's a little bit of noise in the revenue line\u2026","John Nadel","Okay.","Richard Dziadzio","\u2026.that can skew a little bit of the margin-type issues. And as Alan said earlier, we are looking for the earnings to be lower in the second half of the year, the underwriting results we talked about and the investments we're making, the launches that ended up going into Q1. So all of those things together really -- we really focus on the net income and driving net income growth which obviously we've had a tremendous first half.","Alan Colberg","Yeah. And John, the other thing to think about \u2026","John Nadel","And Yeah\u2026","Alan Colberg","\u2026 we've talked often about the new clients in the pipeline. Our pipeline is actually even stronger than we had anticipated. And it's really a tribute to the \u2026","John Nadel","Got you.","Alan Colberg","\u2026situation we have in the market. We are investing\u2026","John Nadel","Yeah.","Alan Colberg","\u2026as we go into Q3, to make sure we can capture as many of those as possible, because they will create substantial long-term value.","John Nadel","That -- and that was, going to be my next sort of segue, was just thinking about the longer-term outlook here.","If we rewind the clock a couple of months to your Investor Day, it seems like, with a couple of quarters under our belt since then. The baseline of both revenues and earnings for lifestyle is higher than you had expected it would be this year.","And I just wonder, how that may be impacts the expected growth, for the business, in particular earnings growth. As you look out to 2020 and '21. Should we expect that there's been any real change in that outlook, or is it just a similar growth pattern, just off of a higher base of earnings?","Alan Colberg","So, couple of thoughts on that, John. First of all, I think we feel even better positioned today, than we did at Investor Day in lifestyle. The momentum is strong. And so that's very encouraging. As a reminder\u2026","John Nadel","Yeah.","Alan Colberg","\u2026the targets at Investor Day are multiyear.","And so what we normally \u2026","John Nadel","Yeah.","Alan Colberg","\u2026do as part of our Q4 earnings call, we'll give you granular detail on what to expect in 2020 with our Q4 earnings call. But I would just leave it as momentum is strong and we feel even better positioned, than we were back at Investor Day.","John Nadel","Okay. Fair enough. And then, two more real quick ones, one is, do you expect small commercial will be an earnings impact on 2020, or do you think it'll be gone, exited by the end of this year?","Richard Dziadzio","As I said, we are exiting the business. I mean, so really, we're thinking that it'll be substantially over. Can I say zero for next year? No, probably not. But we're not expecting \u2026","John Nadel","Okay.","Richard Dziadzio","\u2026anything material.","John Nadel","Okay. And then last one is just, pace of buybacks. I guess I pushed on this a little bit in the last couple of quarters. But your momentum is so strong I guess I'm just trying to understand. I know you've been a consistent re-turner of capital\u2026","Richard Dziadzio","Yeah.","John Nadel","\u2026I just -- guess I'm wondering why not a little bit faster on the buyback your opportunity to retire shares in advance of what seems to be really good underlying momentum and earnings growth.","Alan Colberg","No. John, it's fair. We obviously feel very good about where our business is and how it's performing. We did make a commitment in Investor Day to return $1.35 billion over the next three years. We're making progress against that.","As a reminder, though, we do buy back under 10b5-1s we can't just change them on the fly. So, you've seen what we're doing. You should expect we will continue to be buyback. We'll buyback through cat season this year as we've done the last few years.","But we're on track \u2026","John Nadel","Okay.","Alan Colberg","\u2026to meet our expectation over that multiyear period.","John Nadel","Okay. Thanks I\u2019ll get back in a queue. Thanks.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Campbell from KBW. Please go ahead.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good mourning, Alan.","Christopher Campbell","Yeah, good morning.","Alan Colberg","Good mourning, Chris.","Christopher Campbell","Hey, great. I guess just starting on the small commercial part of Global Housing. Just looking at -- I mean, you guys had $12 million in year-to-date losses. So I get about 138% combined ratio or something like that.","So I guess, just with rates hardening in your commercial property and liability lines, why did you just -- why did you decide to exit versus just taking rate increases on the book?","Richard Dziadzio","Yeah. I think, in all the businesses we're in we bring something special. And we add a lot of value, we had innovation. And you can see the growth that we have in lifestyle, what we're doing in lender-placed, multifamily housing. The new systems we're rolling out.","And even within special property, we're always launching new things to try to create something special, something different. And I think we've come to the conclusion that in this area we just -- we can't do that in the short-term. So we've made the strategic decision to exit.","Alan Colberg","Yeah. And Chris I'd add couple of thoughts to that, one is the book developed. We didn't like the geographic exposure. It was more costal than we wanted and we really didn't want to build that part of the book.","And then, when we look at across our portfolio and deploying our resources and capital, we have substantially better opportunities elsewhere. And so that led us to very quickly make the decision, that we're better off to move on and put that investment elsewhere.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. Got it, that makes sense. Switching to lifestyle, I was looking at the mobile device growth which only grew like 10.6% which is I think the lowest growth rate you've had since 3Q, 2017. So how should we think about the mobile device growth like going forward? And then what's your current U.S. market share and where do you think you can get to over time?","Alan Colberg","So, quite a few questions in there, Chris. So if I forget some of them, please come back to me. I mean I think the -- if you look at mobile devices, we think of it is a long-term driver of value for our shareholders and we're going to continue to add them.","As we've talked about as we launched new programs they generally take anywhere from three to four years to ramp to maturity and we have a lot of new programs that have just begun. And so, we expect that is going to grow and will grow well independent of what happens in the market.","We're also adding services. And if you remember back in Investor Day we had that chart that show how we\u2019ve started to try to stack additional services and many of them are fee income onto that growth. So again quarterly growth, I wouldn't put too much focus on that. I think it's more the longer term. We look year-on-year on the momentum that we're driving in the business.","In terms of market share, again we have a leadership position with one important client and there are several others that we have little position in. So we have substantial opportunities for growth in the U.S. market as we look forward.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. Great. And then just on Global Auto, I noticed growth slowed down there too like -- it was like 3% -- 3% or 4%. Any color on what's happening in the auto side in lifestyle?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. No I think when we look at Auto, we're really pleased. I mean as Alan talked about TWG integration I think the synergies and the growth that we're getting behind the scenes. We've talked in previous calls about our ability to retain the clients that came over in the TWG acquisition.","So when we look at it we're on a good growth pattern. And we look probably less quarter-to-quarter as over a longer period of time. We are investing here so you'll see the earnings are not as strong as they otherwise could have been, but we're investing to continue to grow in the future.","Alan Colberg","Yes. And auto has an interesting dynamic in that it's really about share gain. So unlike mobile where the partnerships tend to be more exclusive these are businesses where there are many competitors. So we are really focused on differentiating our service, our product, our offerings to allow us to gain share over time leveraging our position.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. And then what are the nature of the investments that you guys are going to accelerate in the second half of the year?","Alan Colberg","Well there -- in lifestyle they really fall into a couple of buckets. One in every product we are working to add services to create value beyond the underlying insurance or service contracts. So we have roadmaps that we've been executing against in mobile we're now executing against auto. An example would be Pocket Drive in auto. So that's one set of the investments.","The second area of investment really is around consumer experience. Now we are in the process of driving significant digital capabilities through every one of our products and really evolving that. And then finally we are continuing to add clients and programs. And so there's a significant investment to ramp those programs that will be going on in the second half of the year.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. Great. And then just one last one you all asked a Preneed question. So I think you had mentioned in the script additional Preneed distribution opportunities. So what are those?","Alan Colberg","So in Preneed as you know we've had a long-term historic partnership with the industry leader. In recent years, we've been looking for additional growth that can really help us strengthen our position. So we've been both adding distribution and then also looking for ancillary products similar to what we've done elsewhere.","I mentioned on previous earnings calls we've started to experiment with things like an executor product really ways to add more value beyond the Preneed product. So we're encouraged by the momentum in that business as well.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. And would organic growth or inorganic growth make sense in that segment? Will there be anybody worth acquiring?","Alan Colberg","Yes. I think we feel well positioned with our business today and I think we're just going to continue to execute against our plan.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, great. Thanks for all the answers.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Michael Phillips","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just want to start on the housing side again. Your loss -- your expense ratio there, I'm sorry your combined ratio was pretty good and kind of at the low end of that long-term target of 86 to 90. And I guess since it's there -- it's been there actually it's kind of been there for a while. So how do you think about the impact that has maybe on housing strategy in terms of I don't know maybe growth goals? And like you've got some cushion there, since you're at the low-end of the margin, so just -- how does it affect your strategy of that business for growth?","Alan Colberg","So maybe I'll start and Richard you can add to it. The way we think about housing is we have a really strong growth engine in multifamily and rental and we've been continuing to gain share there. You can see the policy counts for example in our supplement and we're continuing to invest to differentiate what we do there. We're driving digital throughout that entire business. We're working hard on the point of lease. That's really the growth driver.","For the more traditional risk businesses like lender-placed, we've really been focused on ensuring we are well positioned to be participating in any kind of upside that comes. And to have those businesses which generate a lot of cash flow for us continue to drive a lot of cash flow. So we've done things like lower the attach point in the reinsurance tower, so that there's less volatility in the earnings coming out of those traditional risk businesses.","We've been investing in what we call single-source platform SSP, which is really to differentiate the user experience and allow us to scale the economics over time. So I would think about growth really in multifamily and the balance of it keep it stable and throw off cash with upside if we get into any kind of housing slowdown.","Richard Dziadzio","And I would you add the last thing is we talked about. If something is not working, we take action. So I mean it's a great business.","Michael Phillips","Okay. Thank you. I guess on the TWG, the synergies you're well ahead of plan there. I guess anything else we can expect going forwards to supplement the $60 million? And then also in the same kind of note you've talked about some revenue synergies there and any developments on revenue synergy that you saw since last quarter?","Alan Colberg","Yes. I think we feel very good about where we are. We're now a year plus into the integration. Our client relationships are stronger across the board than they were at the time of the merger. We are investing to leverage the joint capabilities. So we'll continue to push for incremental expense synergies, but that's largely complete at this point. Our focus now is much more on growth and how do we leverage both sides and that will continue.","Michael Phillips","Okay. Great. Thanks. I guess maybe one or two more. From the specialty, P&C business that you got out of, is there any benefit in 2020 from reinsurance because of that?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. So in terms of overall exposure, it will come down. So the absolute reinsurance cost would come down with that.","Michael Phillips","Okay. Great. I guess just one last one. Just an update -- you mentioned some new developments and some things you're rolling out on the technology platforms and you mentioned maybe kind of a rollout since last quarter Pocket Drive. I guess maybe what does that do and any early reads on how that's going?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So Mike it's very early with Pocket Drive. But what we're trying to do there is leverage our capabilities, so we developed something called Pocket Geek which is now well entrenched in mobile. It's all about the user experience in creating a better ownership experience for the consumer. We leveraged those capabilities to create Pocket Drive, which has a similar goal. It's all about the user experience of owning your car. But it's very early and we have been in pilots or we're in pilots now with -- goes well we expect to roll it out broadly. But it really differentiates our position in the market and helps us be well positioned to gain share over time.","Michael Phillips","Great. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning, Gary.","Gary Ransom","Good morning. You mentioned along the way that there was a client that was -- that left in lender-placed. I wondered if you could describe what the reasons might have been. And maybe even thinking back over time, I'm sure there's ins and outs over time what is it that causes this mortgage servicers to move like that?","Alan Colberg","Probably not appropriate to speculate on what caused any given client to do something. I think what we'd say there is we've had a strong track record of gaining share in that business to the position we now have. We're aligned with effectively all the major market leaders now in that business.","And with the movement that we saw in the second quarter and what we've talked about in the prepared remarks it has no effect, it's not material to our overall earnings. So again, I think we're well positioned. We are investing heavily to differentiate that business as well. So again, I think we feel good where we are with lender-placed.","Gary Ransom","Okay. I also wanted to ask about the -- a little bit about the commercial, but sort of broader. I assume you looked at it as an experiment, so you were trying something. But in thinking about your broad-based strategy, I guess the way I think about it is you have a servicing value chain that's embedded in a consumer purchase value chain. And I -- what was it about commercial business that fit into that strategy, or am I -- maybe I'm missing something.","Alan Colberg","No Gary, I think about our businesses having two real sources of differentiation. One you mentioned is we partner and we're embedded in the value chain. That really is lifestyle, that's mobile, that's really where multifamily is actually headed. In our housing risk businesses, we do better than market because we find kind of unique capabilities, unique distribution.","We were experimenting to see if we can find another one like that and it just didn't work out so that's why we took a decision quickly. But we like risk businesses where we can have some sort of unique advantage and we had a thesis that just didn't work out on that one.","Gary Ransom","Are there any of the other \"experiments\" that you're working on in that area that are starting to take off or show more promise?","Alan Colberg","Yeah. In the multi-family world, rental, we've been doing a lot of experimenting around the sharing economy and some of those have gone quite well. As we grow -- now those are a little bit different, they're not as -- they're not really traditional risk businesses the same way, but we're encouraged by some of those experiments. And if they work we'll scale them.","Gary Ransom","Okay. And one more on the capital intensity, one of the things that I was thinking about is how sometimes it's a fee business, sometimes it's insurance. But when it's insurance, it's running through an insurance entity that has regulatory capital requirements and the like. And trying to make it capital light is -- could be doing more contracts that are not insurance-oriented or not structured as insurance. And I wonder is that something you control or can control, or is that almost all on the client's side and their decision process?","Richard Dziadzio","I think, there's a couple of things in that. I think first if I step back and look at the overall enterprise, you'd say -- I would say that lifestyle is less capital intensive than housing obviously. And you're exactly right. I mean, one of the things that I think is a real great -- is a great value that Assurant brings to clients is we're able to bring this insurance business and also all the other value adds that we have that are not necessarily insurance-based.","The premium tech support-type things that we do, the administrative support, the marketing, the training everything that we do that's not -- that we get paid a fee for that's not based. Do we control it? I think what we do is we go up to our clients and one of our values is we say to clients, what would you like? And we can customize an offering for them. With the growth of lifestyle and the growth of mobile and all the added services we're adding, I think just by nature of that it's becoming less capital intensive. And as we win new clients they are probably less capital intensive given all the added services that we're bringing to them.","Gary Ransom","So is it fair to say based on what you just said that the trend toward the client desires is toward a slightly lower capital-intensive approach?","Richard Dziadzio","I think in the lot of the businesses we're doing, I mean if we look at for example the auto business I mean, it is -- there's insurance behind it. But in many instances the transactions we're doing with our clients they're sharing the risk, if not all a good part of it. So that is capital light. So no I think the trend is more toward capital light. At the same time, as we see that fee businesses growing than the capital business it's just a weighted average calculation at the end of the day that the overall business becomes less capital intensive as we go forward. Also, the things the moves that we've made on the housing business, where we brought down the retention also helps us as well.","Gary Ransom","Right. All right. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Alan Colberg","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Dziadzio","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning, Mark.","Mark Hughes","Hope you might touch on the investment income. It's been a little bit up and down last few quarters definitely down sequentially in the second quarter. Is this a reasonable run rate, or is it just going to continue to be volatile?","Richard Dziadzio","Well, in the first quarter we really had a mark-to-market of a real estate portfolio that we have, and so that gave us some nice earnings as we reported out. So from time-to-time we will get those real estate gains that we report out. We have them in the supplement and so forth. So the choppiness that comes is typically good news I would say over a kind of a run rate. We manage the portfolio more on an income basis, so we don't see big volatility within the underlying portfolio from period to period. Most of the portfolios in high-grade fixed income, so the volatility, if anything it's a good thing for us. So I look at it Mark more over a longer period of time and you'll get a nice run rate there.","Mark Hughes","And just so I'm clear with that mark-to-market on the real estate portfolio was that 4Q better than 1Q?","Richard Steven","No, it was 1Q.","Alan Colberg","We had some gains in 4Q as well. So yes there were gains there and there were gains in 1Q as well.","Mark Hughes","Okay. Thank you.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question is coming from John Nadel from UBS. Please go ahead.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning, again John.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning, again. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just a couple of real quick ones. One, is there any update you can provide publicly as it relates to how things are moving along around Ik\u00e9 Asistencia?","Richard Steven","I think the update is we're still on the path that we had set out last quarter. We're looking at our strategic options. We're I would say looking out in the market at those options. It's very \u2013 it's still early days obviously as we kind of gear up to look out and so forth. So no other update other than that and we'll be back every quarter if something material happens.","John Nadel","Okay. I mean, but do you feel like there's actually any progress or is it just quiet?","Richard Steven","Oh, no, no. We've set the path for ourselves and to go out into the market get our strategic options. Can't say where that's going to go its early days. But no, we're progressing well.","John Nadel","Okay. And then, I guess, last one is just this. Alan, I think in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about T-Mobile. I don't recall exactly what you said. I might have joined just a little bit too late. But maybe you could just sort of reiterate what's happening there. And then relatedly, whether they gain approval to merge with Sprint, what do you think it would take for Assurant to win Sprint's business or somebody's business like that? And is that part of the investment spending that you are characterizing as sort of already part of your plans, or would that be something that you would expect would be incremental if you felt like that opportunity was right in front of you?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So John, let me start with T-Mobile, since that was what I mentioned in the prepared remarks. What I was referring to there is that we are in the process now of implementing the move of Metro by T-Mobile over to Assurant. And as we complete that we're proud now to be the device protection partner for all of T-Mobile's businesses. So that's a great position.","John Nadel","Got you.","Alan Colberg","It's really a result of the years of working side-by-side with them really helping differentiate their business as they revolutionize the industry. So we feel well positioned with T-Mobile, no matter what happens in the market with mergers. And in terms of what's happening in the market, we couldn't speculate on what might or might not happen. But in Investor Day, when we gave our long-term outlook, we didn't contemplate any major new client coming our way. So if we did get one that would be incremental to what we've been talking about.","John Nadel","Okay. And incremental on both sides of the income statement if you will the incremental from a revenue perspective, but also incremental from -- you have these upfront costs related to new clients acquisition if you will.","Alan Colberg","Yes. We built our plan with the line of sight we had with the clients that we have partnerships with. We didn't contemplate in the long-term outlook new clients.","John Nadel","Got you. And if I can sneak one more in. Can you just give us an update on how things are going with respect to Apple as well as the modest but new arrangement you've got with Verizon?","Alan Colberg","Without going into a lot of specifics on how individual clients are performing I think we feel good with our evolving partnership with Apple. And we're now working with them in multiple geographies and we're expanding our reach in their value chain over time so I think we feel good with that. And with Verizon and the other major prospects both in the U.S. and outside of the world we're working hard to differentiate and show that we can bring innovation and we'll see where those go over time, but we do believe we're a disruptive player and that we can help really these clients win over time.","John Nadel","Thanks so much. Really good quarter. Keep up the momentum.","Alan Colberg","All right. We appreciate it. Thank you for everyone. So thanks for participating in today's call. We're pleased with our first half performance and believe we're well positioned to deliver our financial objectives for the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our third quarter earnings call in November. In the meantime, please reach out to either Suzanne Shepherd or Sean Moshier with any follow-up questions. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd","Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. As noted in the release, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 we revised our reportable segments to align with the company\u2019s new global operating model. As a result our reportable segments now comprise Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate. In addition, we also enhanced our disclosures by adding key segment profitability metrics and other relevant data points to our financial supplement. Most notably we now include the combined ratio for risk based business and the pretax margin for Connected Living, our fee-based capital-light offerings in Global Lifestyle. These metrics enable investors to better track our performance in these critical distances.","As a reminder, net operating income includes contributions from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Health runoff operations, the divested employee benefits business, the amortization of deferred gain from dispositions and other items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the Company. Related prior period results in the financial supplement and news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financial and better align with our new operating structure.","On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are important in evaluating the Company's performance. For more details on these measures the most comparable GAAP measures and the reconciliation of the two please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com. We will begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC report including Form 10-K. and 10-Q.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Colberg","Thanks Suzanne. Good morning everyone. Our performance for fourth quarter of 2016 was in line with our expectations. While net operating income was lower driven by higher reportable catastrophes and lender-placed normalization, Global Lifestyle performance improved year-over-year. As we reflect on 2016, we view the year as one of transition. Our efforts were focused on implementing the critical building blocks of our transformation and continuing to position the company for long-term profitable growth. The progress made this year to complete our portfolio realignment and implement a new organizational framework will allow us to do three things. First, continue to expand in our targeted growth areas. Second, develop innovative solutions for our clients and consumers. And third, realize efficiencies in 2017 and beyond. While we have more work to do this year, the foundational elements are in place and have made us a stronger Assurant.","In 2016, we established the global business unit structure and completed the realignment of our technology, risk, strategy and finance organizations. In addition, our enterprise transformation office has already begun to help ensure we capture the value from more integrated global enterprise. A key milestone in our portfolio realignment includes the wind-down of Assurant Health which is now substantially complete. We received the majority of the risk mitigation payments due from CMS including a $14 million payment in January and have only $17 million in net receivables still outstanding. At the end of December, less than 200 policies remained. And in the fourth quarter, we received an additional $120 million in dividends from Health totaling $458 million for the year. These dividends along with nearly $900 million from the sale of employee benefits contributed to our strong capital position. As did another $350 million dollars from our operating segments. This allowed us to both return capital to shareholders and to invest in the housing and lifestyle markets where we believe we can outperform long term.","Let\u2019s shift now to some business highlights for the quarter and the year. In Global Housing, we strengthened our leadership position in the manufactured housing market with the Green Tree Insurance Agency acquisition. With nearly $40 million in annualized revenues and $25 million in expected incremental premium, Green Tree expands our voluntary housing offering and deepens our alignment with this leading mortgage company. In late December, we reached an agreement related to the lender place multi-state market conduct examination and a separate agreement with the Minnesota State Insurance Department. In addition to settlement payments, the agreed modifications put into practice various procedures already largely implemented across Assurant lender-placed business. We are pleased to resolve these regulatory matters. Over the course of the year we continue to invest in the transformation of our lender-placed platform to further enhance our strong customer service offering. We also increased our loans tracked to 36 million, up 8%, further solidifying our leadership position in this market.","Turning to our housing fee-based capital-light businesses. Multifamily housing increased revenues by 14% to $320 million in 2016. We now protect almost 1.5 million renters across the growing property management network and infinity relationship nationwide. Additionally, mortgage solution is investing in key technology enhancements to support continued growth across field and valuation services. And we added products and services through the acquisition of American Title. In 2016, the business grew fee income by 14% to nearly $330 million. Multifamily housing and mortgage solutions now account for 28% of the segment\u2019s revenue. And we continue to expand our business with new and existing clients while adding innovative offerings. In Global Lifestyle, we reinforced our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect nearly 32 million devices worldwide. In 2016, we processed 8.8 million devices at our repair and logistics operations in the US helping to drive nearly 20% growth in fee income for Global Lifestyle.","Recently, we also made a small investment in mobile device and asset disposition in South Korea, strengthening our footprint in Asia, an important priority for Assurant. In addition to this acquisition, we also grew organically through expanded relationships and new offerings across mobile carriers, e-commerce and OEM distribution channels. At the same time, we are continuing to manage the impact of declines in legacy businesses. Our focus remains on ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide. These factors in addition to increasing scale are important to margin expansion over time. In Global Preneed, we now provide pre-funded funeral insurance to 1.9 million policyholders across North America. Our breadth and depth of experience in this area along with our long-term partnerships gives us the scale and data that enables us to help our clients grow their business. Our integrated approach also allows us to be a single point of contact for the [indiscernible] home offering us seamless experience for the end consumer.","As we continue to make progress in our multi-year transformation, performance is measured against three key financial metrics; net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of the weather. For full-year 2016, net operating income decreased by 9% to $379 million primarily due to the expected decline of lender-placed. Despite lower income, operating earnings per diluted share increased modestly to $6.12, up from $6.06 in 2015, driven by our disciplined capital deployment. Full-year operating ROE excluding AOCI was 10.5%. Fee-based capital-light offerings now represent 52% of revenue. Continuing to grow these businesses will be an important driver in achieving our goal of 15% ROE by 2020.","At the end of December, holding company capital totaled $775 million. This is after returning $995 million to shareholders in 2016. We have now delivered two thirds of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017. We also deployed approximately $210 million in strategic investments last year to strengthen our offerings, capability and distribution in housing and lifestyle. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect Assurant\u2019s net operating income excluding reportable catastrophe losses to be roughly level with 2016 earnings also excluding cat losses. Growth in Connected Living, multifamily housing, mortgage solutions and our vehicle protection business will offset declines in lender-placed and other legacy businesses. We are already realizing savings from our enterprise transformation projects while in the short term, we are investing in procurement, IT and other initiatives that will drive profitable growth over time.","We also expect to grow operating earnings per share excluding catastrophe losses by double digits this year primarily due to the share repurchase activity already executed throughout 2016. Over the long-term, we are committed to growing net operating income and generating 15% average annual growth in operating earnings per share. We're confident the progress made in 2016 will enable us to produce meaningful operating earnings growth longer term as we progress further toward our 2020 objectives. We believe our attractive business portfolio and a more efficient operating structure will produce more diversified earnings while continuing to generate strong cash flow to support our disciplined capital management strategy.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook for 2017 in greater detail. Richard?","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you, Alan. And good morning everyone. Before I begin I want to remind everyone that unless specifically mentioned all of my comments are related to fourth quarter 2016 as compared to the prior period last year. Overall, as Alan said Assurant results came in as we expected. We'll start with Global Housing which produced earnings of $10.8 million including $44 million of reportable catastrophe losses related to Hurricane Matthew. Excluding Cat losses net operating income was down $13 million. This was due to continued lender-placed normalization and additional regulatory expenses. The combined ratio for Global Housing risk-based businesses increased 15% to 105% driven by higher Cats. Excluding Cat losses, the combined ratio was 88.8%, up 2 percentage points. This was the result of higher regulatory and new client onboarding expenses. More favorable non-Cat losses related to lower frequency and severity of claims were modestly offset. Multifamily housing and mortgage solutions generated a pretax margin of 11.2% down 50 basis points. Expanded profitability in multifamily housing was more than offset by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses.","Turning to revenue, fourth quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 5% primarily due to lower placement and lower premium rates. Our placement rate of 2.13% in the third quarter decreased to 2% at year end. As we mentioned on our last call, we started to onboard 2.7 million loans in the third quarter and lower than average placement rates. These new loans drove about 9 of the 13 basis point decline. The remaining 4 basis point reduction relates to the ongoing lender-placed normalization. Now let\u2019s move to revenue for our fee-based Global Housing businesses. Multifamily housing increased to 11%. This reflects double-digit growth in renter policies sold to our affinity channels and property management network. For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 5% including the acquisition of American Title. If we exclude the acquisition, mortgage solutions was down 10% primarily related to lower volumes in field services.","As we continue to work toward our 2020 goal of 15% to 20% pretax margins in the housing fee based business. We will continue to invest in technology that supports business expansion, while we also look to create efficiencies. As Alan mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Green Tree Insurance Agency last week. Through this deal Assurant will retain its existing book of volunteer insurance for borrowers serviced by Ditech Financial Services. And we will have the opportunity to write additional housing business all at attractive double-digit margins. Taking into account the amortization of intangibles, we expect this transaction to have minimal impact on Global Housing\u2019s earnings in 2017 and to be accretive over time. For 2017, we anticipate a continued decline in Global Housing premiums and earnings excluding catastrophe losses as we move closer to a normalized steady state and lender-placed. Revenue growth in our fee-based businesses is expected to continue. And overall, we believe these offerings will account for a larger portion of the segments earnings as we capture market share. Additional expense savings from initiatives implemented across our Global Housing are also expected. Longer term, we continue to expect Global Housing to produce a 20% plus operating ROE as we maintain our leadership position in lender-placed and grow our fee-based product and services.","Now let\u2019s move to Global Lifestyle. The segment\u2019s earnings increased by $15 million to $35 million. This was largely due to improved performance in mobile and service contracts along with higher investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Year-over-year mobile improvement was driven by lower expenses along with a more profitable mix of devices. Revenue in Global Lifestyle decreased by 4% mainly driven by premium declines from a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, revenue was lowered by the impact of foreign exchange and also continued reductions in legacy retailers and credit insurance. This was partially offset by growth in our vehicle protection business as well as fee income from expanded mobile service offerings. In the fourth quarter as I mentioned there was a change in a program structure for a large service contract client. While this change has no bottom line impact it did reduce revenues by $47 million. We expected also to reduce 2017 premium and expenses by $500 million. The revised contract does allow us to deepen our relationship with a long-term client. This change will also affect our Global Connected Living pretax margin which we now expect to increase from 8% to 9.5% by 2020.","The combined ratio for the risk-based business which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance increased by approximately 100 basis points to 95.6%. A modest increase in vehicle protection losses was partially offset by better credit loss experience. Overall, the quarterly and full-year combined ratios are within the 96% to 98% range which we would expect to maintain through 2020. The pretax margin for the fee-based business for Global Connected Living was up from negative 1% to a positive 3.7% this quarter. The key drivers were improved performance from both mobile as well as service contracts. In 2017, we expect net operating income in Global Lifestyle to increase. This will come from Connected Living driven primarily by mobile along with higher profitability from the vehicle protection business and expense savings. At the same time, we will continue to manage declines from US credit insurance and lower production from North American retail clients. Net earned premiums in fees for the segment overall will be down for the year due to the client contract change. However, excluding this change, revenue is expected to increase from growth in mobile and vehicle protection. Our results are also subject to the impact of foreign exchange and variability in the mobile market. While fluctuations from year to year are likely, we continue to expect 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term.","Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased modestly to $10.9 million mainly the result of $1.4 million of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Underlying performance of the business was otherwise stable. Total revenue for the quarter was up 7%. This was due in part to sales written in previous years that are now beginning to earn. In 2017, we expect fee income and earnings to grow in Preneed from increased production across North America and operational efficiencies. Before turning to corporate, I did want to point out one additional change. A part of our new segment reporting, the goodwill in former solutions segment was distributed between Lifestyle and Preneed, approximately $140 million of solutions goodwill has been allocated to Preneed as of December 31. Therefore, our previously announced ROE target of 12% is now 11%.","Moving to corporate, the fourth quarter loss decreased $10 million to $20 million. The change was due to lower taxes and increased investment income from higher assets at the holding company. This was partially offset by an increase in expenses to support our multi-year transformation. For the full year 2017, we expect the corporate loss to approximate $70 million, as expense savings are offset by investments to support our multi-year transformation.","Moving to capital, we ended the quarter with $525 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $341 million in total dividends, comprised of $245 million from capital previously supporting the Employee Benefits business and helped run off operations and $96 million from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed. For 2017, we expect the segment dividends will approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the business and rating agency requirements. ","In addition, we anticipate receiving about $100 million in dividends from Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, pending regulatory approval. Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to first return $212 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Second, to complete a tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2034, reducing deployable capital by $125 million. And finally, to set aside $130 million in advance of the February close of the Green Tree Insurance Agency acquisition as well as for the investment in mobile device capabilities. Through February 3rd, we bought back an additional 378,000 shares for a total of $36 million.","So to summarize, there are a few things we want to take away from today's call. 2016 was another critical year in our multi-year transformation. We're making great progress, implementing a stronger and more efficient operating model and we are expanding profitably within our targeted growth areas. All of these elements in aggregate will help position the company for long term profitable growth.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Mark Hughes","Good morning. Thank you. In the mortgage solutions business, you talked about lower volume in field services. Is this still a growth business for you, do you have any visibility for expanded relationships in that area that can bring in new revenue?","Alan Colberg","Yeah, no, this is absolutely a growth business for us. If you go back to when we made our first acquisitions in this area, about 2.5 years ago, we knew that broadly the market would decline as foreclosure volumes normalize. But we had an explicit strategy to gain share by partnering with the leading companies that are already our partner around lender-placed homeowners. That's worked very well. Part of the issue in Q4, you have some normal seasonality in the field side of the business, where volumes are higher in Q2 and Q3 and lower in Q4 and Q1. But we feel very good about the progress. We have a new leader that just joined to try to really integrate all of the four businesses together and give us a platform to drive even further growth in that business.","Mark Hughes","In the housing business, you talked about higher regulatory expenses, causing the -- contributing to the 200 basis point increase in combined ratio, excluding the CATs. How much of that carries over into 2017 with these settlements, how much is the incremental expense that revenue hit for the coming year?","Alan Colberg","So I think what we've talked about there, the settlement has been fully now reserved for in 2016. So as we make payments under the multi-state settlement, assuming it's fully implemented in March, there's no impact on 2017. And as far as regulatory, at this point, as you've seen, we worked closely with all of our regulators, we cooperate fully when there are issues and questions and we feel appropriate, we're in a good position with our regulars at this point.","Mark Hughes","With the change in business practices, anything like that, does that have an ongoing impact on the margin or is it truly one-time?","Richard Dziadzio","The change in practices have already largely been implemented. We started five plus years ago now evolving the product, evolving our processes, ending things like quota shares that have been in place. So as we reach the settlement with the multi-state, the practices that are moralized there are largely the practices that are already in place.","Mark Hughes","And final question, where do you think now, we bottom out in terms of steady state in the lender placed business. What placement rate and when does that happen?","Alan Colberg","The market is, as we've said, we've been wrong often in the timing of the normalization, but not wrong on really where the normalization is headed. In 2011, when we put out the original 1.8% to 2.1% range, that was looking at the steady state kind of before the crisis. We're getting close to being in that normal range now. The 1.8 to 2.1 will probably update at some point. We have substantially more loans now than we did in 2011. We've added a block, a very large block that is very low placement block, but the way to think about lender placed normalization is we're nearing the end. 2017 is probably the last full year of impact of that normalization.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Seth Weiss","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first on the placement rate in that 1.8% to 2.1% target. I mean should we think of that as directionally being just a little bit lower, just mathematically because of the addition of these 2.7 million low placement rate loans?","Alan Colberg","I think the answer is we still feel good about the 1.8 to 2.1. If we start to see that maybe it could be a little bit lower. We'll update all of you at some point, but right now we still feel good about what we put out.","Seth Weiss","Okay. Great. Thanks. And Richard, I may have missed it. I apologize. The $775 million corporate capital position. I just want to verify that\u2019s net of the $130 million set aside, correct, that's already been taken out of the corporate capital position?","Richard Dziadzio","Yeah. That is exactly right, Seth.","Seth Weiss","Great. So as you think about $1.5 billion goal of buybacks and dividends over \u201916 and \u201917, considering all the pieces of capital you have, which is substantial and considering substantial free cash flow capacity from operating dividends, how should we think about that goal? Is that a moving target which it seems like you could exceed here or should we think about that 1.5 billion as really more of a set target with other money being set aside for perhaps other purposes?","Alan Colberg","So Seth, the way to think about the 1.5 billion was that's effectively the amount of capital that we generated through the sale of employee benefits and the wind-down of health. And we made a commitment to all of our shareholders that over the course of the two years, as that capital came in, we would return its shareholders and that hasn't changed. If you look at the rest of our capital, we have the same ongoing strategy we've always had, which is we're fortunate to have very strong businesses that generate a lot of cash flow. Priority number one is support the organic growth in our targeted growth areas and then the other priorities are continue to return capital to shareholders and look for selective M&A that can deepen or extend in housing and lifestyle. Nothing's changed there.","Seth Weiss","Okay. Great. And then if I could just ask one more on the expense saves and the $100 million target over the long term. I believe that's actually more of a gross number than a net number. So if we\u2019re thinking about kind of the benefits on more of a net basis, how would we think about that?","Richard Dziadzio","Seth, it's Richard. I think what we\u2019ve seen to date and what we\u2019ve talked about to date is the fact that we have started to save, but at the same time, we are in the process of transforming the company. So we\u2019ve done some pretty good things relative to, in our IT area, in our finances, in our COO operation and et cetera. So what we're seeing is during \u201916 and as we said, in \u201917, there is investment that goes along with this save. After that, we will see the save come out. We are targeting the 100 million in the early years of that. So I think part of it will be absorbed. As we go forward, we\u2019ll set through \u201918, \u201919, \u201820, we will see some good saves coming out.","Seth Weiss","Okay. So is it fair to categorize that kind of long term beyond 2020 that $100 million should all fall down to kind of the pretax number.","Alan Colberg","We\u2019ve never said that. What we\u2019ve said is that that\u2019s a gross savings target and some portion of that will probably be reinvested continuously, but we expect a lot of it to fall through the bottom line as we get closer to 2020.","Seth Weiss","Okay. That's helpful. I mean, the expense saves is a theme we\u2019re seeing really across the group, but we tend to see it, the longer term targets on a pretty specific net basis, which is why I asked the question between gross and net. So to the extent that you can get refined in the future periods, I think that would be helpful in terms of thinking about the earnings power.","Alan Colberg","Seth, we agree and we recognize that it -- we owe all of our investors some more transparency on that. And as time goes by, we will definitely do that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning, Alan. Good morning. I guess my first question is around Global Lifestyle. When you guys laid out your plans or targets for the old Solutions segment, you were talking about 10% on average annual growth in earnings from that segment over a multi-year period of time. That was when the total segment was about $195 million of earnings, inclusive of Preneed. Now, I think the target is still 10% earnings growth on average over time, but also the Global Lifestyle piece, which is earning about $150 million dollars give or take, is that the right way to think about it and to think about a much lower earnings growth rate for Preneed?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So let me just clarify our target and then I'll answer your question specifically John. We put that target out for the legacy solutions in 2013. At that point, the business was making about 130 million. So over the three year period, obviously with some variability, the legacy solutions more than delivered on that commitment, but to your specific question, yes, Preneed is not going to grow as fast as lifestyle, so you should think about the 10% as a lifestyle number going forward.","John Nadel","Okay. So we lose a little bit of absolute dollar earnings, as you look out the next couple of years, unless lifestyle grows faster than that 10%. Is that a fair way for me to be thinking about that?","Alan Colberg","Yeah. That's fair.","John Nadel","Okay. And then you guys have provided us now global covered mobile devices, right, which was up a little over 1% year-over-year by year end 2016. There's not a ton of history there. So can't really get a good sense for what the growth rate will look like over a longer period of time. What kind of growth rate in that particular line item do you guys forecast as sort of part of the underlying driver of achieving that 10% longer term growth in earnings for the segment?","Alan Colberg","So you're absolutely right. There's not a lot of history to look at there, but the way to think about this is we only entered this business really in 2008. And so there's been dramatic growth over that time period and we did on our earnings call, maybe a year ago, a couple of years ago, I think we said we had about 20 million devices at that point in time. So you get a sense over the last couple of years of the magnitude of the growth. And we don't -- I'm not going to put out a specific number on what we expect that metric to grow at, but it's an important metric to look at as we try to just more fully penetrate the mobile ecosystem.","John Nadel","Is it fair though Alan to think about it as you guys probably expect more than 1% annual growth in that number?","Alan Colberg","2016 was a year where we were still working through the tablet program loss that we've talked about previously, but certainly we have a history over the last eight years of outgrowing the market. And certainly, as we look at the opportunities we have in our various geographies, we still have that opportunity. The other important point is, it\u2019s not just the devices coverage on. We also are now increasingly doing a range of fee income that is not necessarily related to a device that we cover.","John Nadel","Okay. And I'm not sure if that's necessarily a segue to this question, but I was interested in the, I think, you mentioned in your prepared comments that your operations refurbished a little over 8 million devices during calendar 2016, is that about right?","Alan Colberg","Yeah. I think we said 8.8. John, sorry about that. That was up from about 8 million in 2015.","John Nadel","Okay. And it seems to me like that would be part of that other fee income that you just described, is that right?","Alan Colberg","Yes.","John Nadel","Okay. So is that a number that we can maybe track over time.","Alan Colberg","Let me talk through that with our team and if appropriate, we\u2019ll disclose that as well, but let me just look into that.","John Nadel","Okay. And then just bigger picture, Alan, as you think about the flat operating earnings, I guess it's versus about $380 million in 2016, if I had excluded all the CATs. I think one time unusual items of tax benefit, the legal costs, I think those were largely washing on a year-to-date basis. So it feels like 380 million is the right baseline. At first, I guess I'd asked you if that's reasonable. And then second, as you think about flat for 2017, I suspect that that's not the kind of pace that you need and expect longer term, beyond \u201917 to get to that 15% ROE target by 2020?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So John, first of all, on the 380, that is roughly the right number to think about. So the way we think about it as we out the outlook that it's going to be flat, if you think about achieving our longer term targets, we need to grow operating earnings and we're very focused on that in addition to the disciplined capital deployment. I think we feel good about 2017. We're absorbing another and hopefully the tail end of lender placed normalization. And we're fully offsetting it for the first time in the earnings of the company through the growth in the areas and some of the efficiencies we are realizing that are starting to fall through to the bottom line. So yes, would we like to do more in 2017? Always. But if you look at that outlook, we feel well positioned coming out of 2017 to really grow earnings in 2018 and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","So just a couple of questions and they\u2019re similar to what's been asked before. But as I think about your long-term EPS growth guidance of around 15% and especially beyond 2018, when you've gotten the -- or \u201917 and \u201918, when you've gotten the full benefit of the rapid share buyback plan and you're buying back just based on your free cash flow, it would seem like you need to grow your operating income at a mid -- sort of mid to maybe slightly high single digit rate and that just seems hard to imagine, given that a big part of your business isn't going to be going that fast, which is the lender placed business. So where do you really see a lot of growth in the business that you think can offset the slower growth maybe in lender based as well as in Preneed, if you are to achieve your 15% long term target?","Alan Colberg","So, Jimmy, first of all you're absolutely correct. We need to grow operating earnings and that's what we're very focused on as the leadership team. If we get to the future which we expect where we no longer have the drag of lender placed normalization, we're already realizing very strong growth in mobile connected living and vehicle protection services and multi-family housing and in mortgage solutions. And you combine that with the expense efficiencies that we talked about beginning to drop more to the bottom line, that's how we get to the earnings growth that\u2019s needed in 2018 and beyond to deliver our EPS commitment.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then within the lifestyle business, are there areas where you think you're going to see a pickup in growth, beyond what your, obviously ForEx headwind might abate, but beyond that, are you seeing, the mobile business, are there other parts of that business where you\u2019re actually expecting an acceleration in growth, despite the fact that in a year to two years, the business is going to be larger overall?","Alan Colberg","We\u2019ve had strong growth in mobile. We've had strong growth in service contracts on the digital side. We've just been dealing there with the legacy retailers in decline. That's another headwind that we've been facing that's closer to the end, in the beginning. And then if we look at that business, we think we're well positioned to continue to grow across those products, mobile, service contracts, vehicle.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then just lastly on buybacks, I think if we look at your guidance for the 1.5 billion of capital deployment in \u201916 and \u201917, that implies buybacks of around $400 million this year and you can correct if I'm wrong, but then also should we assume that if there aren't any larger deals or a number of small deals that some of your free cash flow would go towards buybacks for this year as well?","Richard Dziadzio","Yeah. Good morning, Jimmy. It\u2019s Richard's. Yeah and I think I\u2019d go back to Alan's earlier answer, I mean one of the things that we did earlier last year was we put out that target of 1.5 billion and we got ahead of it in 2016, roughly two thirds and I think your math is correct, saying we have 500 million to go. We have about $100 million in dividend that gives us 400 million left to meet that target that we put out. So we are focused on that and meeting that. But what we\u2019ll do during the course of the year, and we do it off and I can promise you is to look at where we are with our level of deployable capital, look at the internal investments we're making, look at the M&A possibilities that we have and think about the best use of that capital and also in particular, thinking about giving it back to shareholders.","Operator","And we have no one left in queue. At this time, I'll turn the call back to Mr. Colberg for closing remarks.","Alan Colberg","Thank you everyone for participating in today's call. We look forward to updating you on our progress in May. As always, you can reach out to Suzanne Shepherd with any follow-up questions. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"2959":["Assurant, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full years 2018. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com.","We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release, as well as in our SEC reports.","During today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Suzanne. And good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance in 2018. We successfully delivered on our financial commitments to shareholders while also investing to ensure a stronger Assurant for the future.","For the full year 2018, we grew net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, by 25%, at the high end of our outlook for the year. This was driven by a lower effective tax rate, by acquisition of The Warranty Group and organic growth in targeted areas.","Operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophes, grew 16%, at a lower rate than net operating income given the 10 million share issuance related to our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We were also pleased by the ongoing cash flow generation of our specialty businesses, which contributes $740 million of dividends to the holding company. As a result, we issued three million fewer shares to finance our TWG acquisition and return $266 million to shareholders through buybacks and common stock dividends. This year through February 8, we returned another $22 million to shareholders as we continue to view our stock as attractively priced.","We also remain confident in the cash flow generation of our businesses. Last November, we increased our common stock dividend by 7%, representing the 15th increase since becoming a public company. More importantly, in 2018, we took steps to sustain outperformance and profitable growth long-term. We further strengthened our leading franchises within Connected Living, Global Automotive and multifamily housing. We did this by broadening our distribution, expanding client partnerships, introducing new and differentiated offerings and acquiring TWG. At the same time, we managed lender-placed declines to support policyholders in the aftermath of natural catastrophes.","Let me now share some 2018 highlights for each of our operating segments. Global Lifestyle's earnings grew by 20% organically as we strengthen our market position with innovative, full-service offerings well beyond insurance. We are pleased with our progress thus far, integrating TWG. We've successfully managed the transition of client relationships with minimal disruption. As we complete our integration later this year, we expect to further capitalize on our leading position with our Global Automotive products and services.","In addition, through year-end 2018, we realized $14 million in after-tax operating synergies. On a run-rate basis, we now have in place more than half of the $60 million pretax target expected by the end of 2019. Within Connected Living, we added new partnerships in the fast-growing cable MSO market while also expanding our relationships with leading OEMs and mobile carriers.","Most recently, we launched a device protection program with Visible, Verizon's all-digital prepaid mobile carrier. This program provides device protection, including accidental damage, loss and theft as well as mechanical breakdown following the manufacturer's warranty. It also includes Pocket Keep, our self-diagnostic platform to help consumers optimize device performance and safeguard personal information. As of year-end, we now protect over 40 million covered devices worldwide, with a growing portion leveraging our premium tech support and self-diagnostic tools.","Global Automotive continues to perform well in 2018 with nearly 16% revenue growth, excluding contributions from TWG. Our combined Global Automotive business benefited from prior year's strong sales with third-party administrators, dealer networks, national accounts as well as leading global OEMs. We now protect 48 million vehicles.","In addition, we are working closely with our partners to develop innovative offerings that reflect the evolution of the automotive market. Most recently, this includes launching Pocket Drive by Assurant, a plug-in vehicle device that empowers auto dealers and customers to benefit from vehicle data and mobile conductivity. This technology-based connected car platform will provide consumers with proactive maintenance alerts, diagnostic warnings, roadside assistance and other features. We believe innovative offerings, such as Pocket Drive will further expand our vehicle protection product suite beyond insurance and deliver significant value to our partners and end consumers.","2018 represented another year of elevated catastrophe activity in Global Housing, with hurricanes in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast as well as the California wildfires. This resulted in $170 million of net after-tax cat losses for Assurant.","As part of our January placement, we substantially lowered our per event retention from 2018, further reducing our earnings exposure to natural catastrophes. While this will result in higher cost, primarily in lender-placed, we believe lowering our cat exposure will help us generate more predictable earnings over time.","2018 net operating income for Global Housing, excluding catastrophes, increased 10% year-over-year. The segment benefited from tax reform, and growth in multifamily housing and our portfolio of Specialty Property offerings. In multifamily housing, we now provide an expanded suite of offerings. This includes a tracking system to ensure continuous renters protection and an integrated billing platform for property management companies and their renters.","We also invested in creating an even more seamless digital experience for our customers, which we believe will enable us to sustain profitable growth in the future. In lender placed, we also recently secured another multiyear contract renewal with one of our top five largest clients, helping us to solidify our leading position in this business.","Moving to Global Preneed. With $58 million of net operating income, the segment continues to be a steady contributor of earnings and cash flow for Assurant. In 2018, we strengthened our client relationships with a multiyear SCI Canada renewal and expanded our distribution with new partnerships. We also added new offerings for the senior lifestyle market, including ancillary products like executor care, to assist in the death notification and estate planning process. This should support continued strong returns and cash flow in the future.","Throughout 2019 and beyond, we will continue to invest in capabilities and offerings that will better support consumers connected lifestyles, leveraging our deep expertise within the mobile, auto and home value chains. And as we do so, we will also look to leverage global talent and scale more effectively to support profitable growth. A recent success in the Japanese mobile market is a great example of this.","We also see additional opportunities to drive even greater efficiency and deliver a superior customer experience as we deploy new technologies, such as artificial intelligence across our portfolio. We believe these initiatives, among others, will support continued profitable growth this year.","Based on current market conditions, we expect 2019 operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses to increase 6% to 10% year-over-year, reflecting continued double-digit earnings expansion.","This range takes into account incremental reinsurance costs to reduce our cat exposure, lowering our EPS outlook by two percentage points. The 2019 share count will include the full year impact of the TWG 10 million share issuance, We\u2019d also assume that the preferred shares will be diluted and added to our share count compared to the anti-dilutive approach in 2018, 2019 earnings growth reflect full year contributions from TWG including an additional $25 million to $30 million of after tax operating synergies.","We also expect modest profitable growth driven in Connected Living, multifamily housing and Global Automotive. This will be partially offset by continued investments in key capabilities to support growth and declines in the legacy credit business within Global Financial Services.","Our outlook also includes the impact of approximately $40 million pre-tax of acquisition related intangible amortization including TWG. Overall cash flow generation is expected to remain strong with segment earnings roughly equaling segment dividends. We will update our view of long-term financial metrics and targets in our coming March 14 Investor Day. Overall, we are pleased with our performance this year. We remain confident in our ability to continue to expand earnings and cash flow long-term. We believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a scalable operating structure will produce more diversified, predictable earnings. This should allow us to continue to invest in our business and return excess capital through buybacks and common stock dividends.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our fourth quarter 2018 results and our 2019 outlook in greater detail. Richard?","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you Alan and good morning everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. The segment reported a net operating loss of $12 million for the fourth quarter driven by $95 million of reportable cat losses related to Hurricane Michael and the November California Wildfires. Excluding these cat losses and lower effective tax rate, earnings decreased $25 million. This was driven by three main factors. First, consistent with others across the industry we experienced higher non-cat claims primarily from increased severity of water damage and weather in our lender-placed business. This compared to abnormally low non-cat loss experience in the prior period.","Second, lender-placed continued to decline as it was reflected in both the lower placement rate and REO volumes. And third, we recorded additional reinsurance premiums in the quarter to account for our full year catastrophe exposure. This had a $6 million after tax impact on earnings. The decline was partially offset by continued growth in multifamily housing and additional investment income from both real estate joint venture partnerships and other related fund investments.","Looking at top line performance, revenues for the segment declined by $61 million reflecting the August sale of mortgage solutions, excluding mortgage solutions, revenue was flat as growth in small commercial property products and multifamily housing offset the reduction in lender-placed premiums.","As Alan noted, we have placed two-thirds of our 2019 catastrophe reinsurance program and as part of this placement we have substantially lowered our per event retention from $120 million to $80 million pretax. We believe this change will further protect the earnings and cash flows of the company during an active cat year. For example, if we were to recast 2017 cat season using this new $80 million retention, we would have recognized around $80 million more of pretax earnings. We also secured additional multiyear coverage and fixed pricing that will help to reduce the annual variation in cost.","For Global Housing in 2019 we expect reverse prior trends and return to earnings growth driven by continued expansion of our specialty property offerings. This includes areas such as multifamily housing and we expect to further increase our penetration of the PMC channel as we leverage digital capabilities to improve the customer experience. We also expect lender-placed earnings to stabilize. While the incremental reinsurance cost will lower results in this business, we will continue to take further actions to manage risk and lower expenses, including our work to streamline our operating platform. Overall, we believe the segment is positioned for long-term profitable growth with significant upside should the economy soften. Also the segment should continue to generate strong cash flows and maintain superior operating returns.","Moving to Global Lifestyle, the segment reported earnings at $98 million for the fourth quarter a $55 million increase year-over-year, excluding a $9.3 million of client recoverable. TWG accounted for $35 4 million of the increase. This is net of $2 million of after tax and tangible amortization and includes $8 million of realized operating synergies. Our lower effective tax rate for Global Lifestyle accounted for another $7 million of the increase. Excluding these items, results increased primarily due to organic growth in mobile, including continued expansion in Asia-Pacific. We also benefited from higher mobile trading volumes and greater utilization of our premium tech support services, similar to Housing, Lifestyle also recording greater real estate investment income in the quarter.","Revenue was up $708 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the acquisition of TWG and continued growth in the North American auto dealer channel. Excluding TWG, revenue increased by $62 million driven by continued organic growth from mobile programs launched during the past two years and vehicle protection programs sold through third-party administrators. Revenue growth is partially offset by unfavorable currency movements.","Looking at Global Lifestyle\u2019s outlook for 2019, we expect continued growth in net operating income. This will be driven by three main factors. First, our full year's contribution from TWG compared to seven months of earnings in 2018. Second an incremental $25 million to $30 million after tax synergies from the acquisition and third, modest organic growth within Connected Living and Global Automotive.","Our outlook reflects additional investments to strengthen our offerings across Global Lifestyle and the integration of TWG. We also expect new program launches in recent client renewals to result in continued profitable growth, albeit at lower margins. In addition, we continue to manage the anticipated declines in our legacy credit business within Financial Services and focus on repositioning our embedded card benefits in the banking sector where we have already seen some initial success.","Next, let's move to Global Preneed. The segment recorded $16 million of net operating income in the fourth quarter up $12 million year-over-year. The increase includes a $3 million benefit from tax rate change with the remaining amount due to the absence of an asset right down in the prior year period. In addition, we recorded higher investment income from both real estate gains and increased yields. Revenue of Preneed was up 5% driven by growth in the U S and Canada. Base sales increased 3% from continued traction in Final Need.","In 2019 we expect Preneed earnings to be roughly flat given a very strong 2018. We will continue to manage expenses closely and look to grow long-term from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings.","At Corporate, the net operating loss was $27.5 million a decrease of $1.6 million. This was due to the absence of workforce reduction charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 and higher real estate investment income, which was partially offset by the adverse impact of the U.S. tax rate change. For 2019 we expect the full year corporate net operating loss to be similar to 2018 even as we continue to grow.","Turning to capital, we ended the year with $473 million in total company capital. We're about $223 million of deployable capital after adjusting for our risk buffer of $250 million. Dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed to the holding company totaled $122 million in the fourth quarter, including $75 million from TWG. We also received $31 million in cash related to the sale of one of our health legal entities, Time Insurance Company. During the quarter we repurchased $49 million of shares and paid $40 million \u2013 $42 million in shareholder dividends, $37 million related to our common stock and $5 million related to our preferred stock.","In 2019 we expect segment dividends from our operating segments to provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders, subject to market conditions. Our current plans also include setting aside capital to the potential purchase of Ik\u00e9 Asistencia.","In conclusion, we're pleased with our strong results for the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2018 which provide a solid foundation to drive continued growth into 2019 and with that operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey good morning Kai.","Kai Pan","Thank you. Good morning again. So my first question on the cat side with the new program you have there. You mentioned would reduce your pretax cat in 2017 by $80 million. What would impact on 2018 the $170 million?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, so Kai, the answer for 2018 would be about $15 million pretax. But let me give a little context on what we're trying to do with the new reinsurance program. So as we've looked at it, as we've talked about over the last few years, this company is transforming and it's becoming much less cat exposed through the growth areas like Connected Living, the acquisition of The Warranty Group. And as we thought about 2019, you look at the severity of the storm seasons for the last couple of years, what we're really trying to protect against is another severe storm season.","And so the way we thought about the additional reinsurance was, yes, in a no cat year, it's a cost. In a typical cat year, it's about a wash and then in a severe cat year, like we had in 2017, we would have a significant amount of additional cash that we could use to benefit our shareholders. So that's how we thought about it and it's a journey that we will continue on as we continue to transform this company to be much less cat volatile.","Kai Pan","Okay, I guess the difference between 2017 and 2018 may be 2018 have more frequency of events, less severity than 2017, so you would not as benefit this much. Would you also consider additional aggregate cover?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes good morning Kai. It\u2019s Richard. I think it definitely was something that we looked at as we went into the end of last year and beginning of this year. We went out to the market, and obviously, looking at our exposure, frequency events and what we're expecting in a kind of an average year and extreme year and our conclusion was that buying down the retention to $80 million excess from $120 million was the best purchase for us. But we will continue as we go forward to look at all options that are out there.","Kai Pan","Okay. Is it $80 million pretax cat loss is still your cat loss assumption going forward?","Richard Dziadzio","No. What I was saying in terms of the $80 million is we brought down our attention, so it's excess $80 million, instead of being excess $120 million. But as Alan mentioned in his remarks, on an average year, it's basically a push overall for the average loss or load that we would have in our plan.","Kai Pan","Okay, that\u2019s great. Let me shift gear to the underlying growth in the Global Lifestyle segments. What's underlying growth, premium growth in both auto as well as Connected Living in the fourth quarter? And just wondering is there a slowing down there? Because your forecast for the organic growth in this segment that you mentioned is modest organic growth in 2019.","Alan Colberg","Yes. So if you look at 2018, I think we are very pleased with the growth in Connected Living broadly. If you look at Q4, I think we were up 7%, excluding The Warranty Group. If you look at \u2013 this revenue. If you look at full year 2018, we were up 9% and that's with the headwinds of unfavourable FX in Latin America. So we feel good about the growth. The challenge when we get to earnings is we are ramping multiple new programs and investing. And so in the short-term, you don't see as much of that flowing through to earnings as you see flowing through the revenues, but it dramatically strengthens Connected Living for the longer-term.","Kai Pan","Okay. The last one if I may, do you have any updates with AppleCare+ as well as potential merger between T-Mobile and Sprint?","Alan Colberg","No. We generally don't go into a lot of detail on how specific clients are performing, but I think we're very pleased with our broad relationship with Apple, not just in the U.S. but in other markets around the world. And then again relative to a potential merger in the market, we have a long-standing track record of innovation and creating value for our clients and that I think positions us well.","Kai Pan","Okay. Thank you so much. I would re-queue. Thank you.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey good morning John.","John Nadel","Good morning Alan. Good morning Richard. So just to square the circle here on the combined ratio, for the catastrophe impact, so over a long period of time, I think, back on Assurant, I think, the more normal or typical catastrophe-type load for the lender-placed business was something like four or five points. On the combined ratio, it sounds like the buy down of the retention is may be going to save you one to one and a half points. Is that the right way to think about that on \u2013 in terms of the typical or normal cat load going forward?","Richard Dziadzio","John good morning, this is Richard. I mean I think the way we look at it, I think overall, the amount of the cost of reinsurance that you had is generally correct. I think as we look at it kind of on an average year in a \u2013 our NOI it will be a push. On our NOI, it will be a push. So that's with cats, obviously. Without cats, it's just the cost. So on average, year-over-year push would be the way to look at it. But in a year like 2017 where there is some extreme events, Harvey, Irma, Maria, et cetera, yes, that would be an $80 million pretax earnings for us, so that would be a significant change in the earnings profile.","And it is another thing that allows us to continue to say profitable growth in the future. Other parts of the businesses have grown, particularly with TWG, so the part of our business that is cat risk is much less already. And then with this additional insurance that we bought, it's even less so.","Alan Colberg","John we\u2019ve just got one thing to clarify. So if you think about our cat load in a average year, what we now expect, given the size of our program, given the reinsurance tower would be $65 million post-tax. That is our specialty cat load. And what Richard was saying is if we had a typical year, our NOI with cat with the new program would be basically unchanged versus what would have been with both program. But we're far better off as a company and for our shareholders if we have a severe storm season, as Richard highlighted, we would have substantially more cash to use in 2017 and 2018.","John Nadel","Yes, I think this is very responsive. You guys have heard that the less volatility in earnings, better \u2013 like the better valuation over the long-term, so I'm a fan. Alan just wanted to talk about it. I think if I understand this correctly, I think you've got three-step robust cost savings program that are going on sort of simultaneously and unrelated to each other. The first you laid out a few years ago was designed to drive that $100 million of growth saves over a multiyear period of time. The second one is the migration to a single platform in the lender-placed business. And the third, of course, TWG.","You've given us the update on TWG and it sounds like everything is well on track there. Can you give just an update on the prior two?","Alan Colberg","Yes, so on the first one, which is our long-term targets to have $100 million of gross expense saves in our G&A, we are fairly far along with that and where you can see the benefit is if you look at our Corporate loss, for example, over 2017 and 2018, if you normalize for the tax rate change is flat, and we've given an outlook of flat again for 2019 despite strong revenue growth for the company. And in total, if you think about that $100 million, we estimate we're about $75 million complete at the $100 million. So we'll continue to work on it. But you're seeing the benefits flowing through the P&L by the ability to grow the company, invest and have a flat Corporate loss.","In terms of our single platform and housing, last year was really about getting the first clients installed and proving out the value capture, which we've now done. As we head into 2019 and 2020, it's going to be a series of conversions of our clients one by one. It will take time to really infect the ratios that we see and get us to our long-term target there, but we really believe that this differentiates our client experience, our consumer expense \u2013 experience and really strengthens our market position in lender-placed.","John Nadel","So following-up on that last one and then I'll re-queue. I think your long-term targeted expense ratio for the risk businesses and housing was 42 to 44, is that still intact? And approximately when do you think you get into that range? Is that dependent on completing this migration?","Alan Colberg","Yes, John, you're accurate in terms of what we had said in the past in terms of the longer-term expense ratio. We're in the process, obviously, of getting ready to update the market on, I would say, all the metrics that are important for us as we go forward during Investor Day on March 14. So I'd assume that will be part of an update on housing and lender-placed specifically.","John Nadel","Okay, thank you.","Richard Dziadzio","Thanks John.","Alan Colberg","Thanks John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Richard Dziadzio","Hey, good morning Mark.","Mark Hughes","Hey thank you. Good morning. Good morning Alan. Good morning Richard. I just want to make sure I'm clear on how you're treating amortization for the guidance for 2019 [ph], I think you said it excludes $40 million of amortization. Is that to say it's more of a cash EPS guidance?","Richard Dziadzio","We\u2019re basically just calling out the amount of amortization that we have in this year. So it's included in all the numbers. We've included in all the numbers, but we know it's important to the market to get a better read on sort of the cash we're generating because we do generate a lot of cash, as you've seen. As Alan said in his remarks, we're still expecting going forward, that the operating earnings from the segments to equal the dividends that we can upstream. So that's just a number that we think that the market will find interesting.","Mark Hughes","Okay. Any updated thoughts on perhaps providing guidance on more of a cash basis?","Alan Colberg","As Richard said a minute ago, Mark, at Investor Day, we will be updating all the metrics we think are important. So let's hold that until Investor Day in about a month.","Mark Hughes","Okay. On the Lifestyle, when you mentioned the modest organic, I think you've said you're ramping up new programs that's having an impact on margin. Are we to think of this at the modest organic is net operating income growth but then the top line growth would be faster?","Alan Colberg","Yes, when we talk about modest organic growth, we're talking about net operating income. The important of the longer term in lifestyle has been that expansion of our programs and clients, and we're now up to what, 46 million subscribers from the low 30s two years ago, so that flows to revenue more quickly than it flows through the P&L just given with the programs you have to build over time.","Mark Hughes","And Richard you had mentioned this $7 million item, I think, in Global Lifestyle. What was that again?","Richard Dziadzio","It was a $9 million item. I think you're talking\u2026","Mark Hughes","It was $9 million.","Richard Dziadzio","It\u2019s client recoverable. So every year, just the nature of the business, basically changes in client contracts, and we had one that was a little bit larger. So we wanted to call it out specifically just so as you model and as the market models and goes forward, it wouldn't take the aggregate amount and kind of extrapolate that. So that's why we called that out specifically.","Mark Hughes","And then a final question. You had referred to, I think, I'm talking about the vehicle expand the product suite beyond insurance. Is that something meaningful we should think about?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, I think it's very early days for automotive. If you think about it prior to The Warranty Group acquisition, we did not have the direct-to-dealer distribution to really drive innovation in the market the way we have in mobile. So what we've done in mobile over the last few years is create a road map that has taken us far beyond insurance in delivering a really superior consumer ownership experience. We are launching the same roadmap for auto.","Now it's very early. It will be a net investment for us in 2019 as we grow that but longer term, we see the same potential that really brought in far beyond insurance and auto as we've done in mobile.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Campbell from KBW. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey good morning.","Christopher Campbell","Yes thanks. Hey good morning. Congrats on the quarter.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you.","Christopher Campbell","I guess my first question is just kind of on the share repurchases. I mean they were very low in 4Q, and I was just surprised you didn't purchase more with the weakness. I guess was this cat-driven or blackout-driven because maybe you guys can't repurchased during that time frame?","Richard Dziadzio","Well we were \u2013 I would sort of start \u2013 I would sort of rewind to the year. I mean originally, we had given an indication to the market that we would be purchasing nothing in 2018, given the acquisition of TWG. We got to the second half of the year and felt a lot better about where we were in terms of market, including the cats, so we entered the market toward the end of the year. We ended up purchasing another $49 million in the fourth quarter that brought our total annual purchase to about $130 million so well ahead of what we thought we would do during the year.","And I think again that sort of underscores the strength of the company. We do, do these repurchases in terms of 10b5-1 so we do them over a period of time and that's really what you're seeing in the beginning of January here as well as we're still in \u2013 as we remained in the market as we've seen in our comments.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, got it. And I think you guys had mentioned in the script potentially using some of the capital to I guess close an acquisition. I guess just how would that impact share repurchases just as we're thinking about for the year?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, I think we've basically \u2013 in our statements and talked about the potential acquisition of Ike Asistencia, which would be sort of the larger thing on the docket. We purchased the first 40% for about $115 million a few years ago. There's a potential acquisition of the remainder of that as the year goes on. So we've kind of put those funds aside already, reflected that in our capital assumptions and again, I'd say, we are in the market as you've seen purchasing. So that's kind of accounted for, I would say.","Christopher Campbell","Got it. And so those funds for the Ik\u00c8 Asistencia one, those would be included in what you have in the excess capital I think, which is the...","Richard Dziadzio","Yes.","Christopher Campbell","So that would be in the 223 right now?","Richard Dziadzio","That\u2019s right. In the 473 total deployable capital as we start the year, that's within, but I would also say I mean we generate cash kind of every day, every month. So as we go forward in the year, that's taken into \u2013 it's taken into account, sorry. It's taken into account already within that projection. It's not 473 minus that amount. It's taken into account within that amount. So sorry about that. Just to be more clear.","Christopher Campbell","Okay got it. Got it. It\u2019s very helpful. And I guess switching to Global Housing I guess you had allocated cat in the property book and then, obviously, you're purchasing more reinsurance. So you probably want to get that baked into pricing. I guess just how are you thinking about your taking rate in the LPI book in 2019 versus your loss costs. And I mean is there any potential for higher rates to help offset some of the PIP decline?","Alan Colberg","Yes, so maybe I'll step back just a bit in housing. Housing really overall has had an inflection point. If you think about the last few years, we've been dealing with steady revenue declines, and obviously, the corresponding declines from profitability. We have turned the corner in housing and we've now set for 2019, we expect growth. That's overall \u2013 that assumes continued modest placement rate declines in lender-placed, assuming the housing market doesn't weaken, that will continue.","But through a combination of expense actions we've taken through ordinary course relationships now at the regulators, we have got LPI stable with the upside if we have weakening of the housing environment and then housing overall is now positioned to grow. So we feel very good about where we are with housing.","Obviously, we're dealing with elevated non-cat loss as the whole industry is and that will work its way into pricing over time for the industry.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, got it. And then just looking at \u2013 I mean, just looking at the concentration of that book, if I go like back to the first quarter of 2017, you've got about 22% in kind of southern coastal regions. Now it's about 25% and I guess, obviously, you had buy down of retentions. But I mean is there an opportunity to buy them down even further? I mean I guess just how do you guys get to the $80 million retention and giving up 2% EPS growth? I guess just what was kind of the calculus behind that for you on a cost-benefit basis?","Alan Colberg","Well you're exactly right. We looked at, I would say a lot of combinations and permutations around what we could buy in the market including as we talked about earlier even ag insurance and it really is a question at the end of the day of total risk appetite and cost benefit of these things. So as we looked at it, we thought we would take a major step and you'll see going down from $120 million of retention to $80 million of retention is a huge step. I wouldn't even start to forecast where we'll go in the future with that, but I think we kind of put the cursor exactly on the place where we want to be for 2019","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. And Chris on the coastal exposure, we've always had coastal exposure given our business model and it hasn't really changed in any meaningful way over time. It moves around 1% or 2% but long-term, it's what we've always had and it hasn't really changed.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, got it. And then just one final one on Lifestyle, I guess where are you seeing the most growth in mobile, extended warranty in automotive? I mean what are kind of the growth areas in those lines?","Richard Dziadzio","So in mobile the growth is coming really from several different things. One, we are adding new clients. So we've talked in the last few quarters about KDDI in Japan as the new client. We've now gotten our first meaningful program with Verizon. We've got Apple in the U S so we're getting a lot of growth from new programs. Those programs generally take two to three years to reach maturity as people buy and replace phones. We're also getting a lot of growth from new services and over the last couple of years we've rolled out Pocket Geek, which is our onboard platform for the consumer experience. And more importantly now we're rolling up premium tech support, which is the really complicated customer care that's creating new growth drivers within our existing client base. So lots of different things are driving the very strong growth in mobile.","And then if you look at autos, that business is a little different in that what flows through the P&L this year. A significant portion of it was based on sales in the past. So we've had very strong sales in the last few years and that's beginning to show through in 2019 and 2020 but where the growth is going to come from for us? Now we're adding more services beyond what we're doing with the traditional vehicle service contracts. So we see good momentum in auto as well.","Christopher Campbell","Great, well thanks for all the answers. Best of luck in 2019.","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you.","Alan Colberg","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","Hey, thank you for the follow up. This is larger picture question. Back in 2016 Investor Day, you laid out three financial objectives, growing net operating income long-term, 15% plus EPS growth and ROE expanding to 15% plus. But if you look at the last couple years your already have been \u2013 in normalized cat[ph] environment probably running around the 10% and in a recent A,M. Best article you mentioned that ROE is an important measure but it\u2019s still coming less so for our business. Could you just elaborate on the ROE objective? Are you going away from that and more focusing on earning growth, EPS growth going forward?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. So let me, I'll comment on the three metrics from 2016 and then partially answer your question and we'll fully answer it in Investor Day in a month. So we laid out three long-term important metrics. One was to grow earnings and that was very significant because we were dealing with the lender-placed declines, we were dealing with the exit of health and benefits. And the very positive news is we've returned to growing earnings. In fact, we've given outlook for 2019 that we are going to have double-digit earnings growth. So we feel that one has been delivered and that's really driven both in Housing and Lifestyle.","Second, we laid out an EPS growth target of 15%. We've delivered about 13% on average over the last three years, so close and we feel pretty good about how well we've done on EPS. Then ROE, we obviously made a decision in the middle to deploy capital to buy the Warranty Group, which obviously added a lot of capital into the company, but fundamentally changed our position in the auto market, which gives us a much better franchise to go with the mobile business we already have. So as we think about it, we have much higher quality of earnings now than we had three years ago.","In terms of ROE, for us we use it as a discipline in making investing decisions, an important discipline. But as our mix continues to evolve and shift it is not as relevant, but we'll talk more about that in Investor Day.","Kai Pan","Thank you so much for the preview. Good luck.","Alan Colberg","Thank you","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS. Your line is open.","Richard Dziadzio","Hey, John.","John Nadel","Many thanks for taking the follow up. Richard, I wanted to follow up on a question from earlier. Without necessarily telling us how much you have earmarked for the buy in of the remaining stake of Ik\u00e9 and I know that's still subject to a footfall option, but \u2013 so it's not given. But is that already reflected in the $473 million of parent company cash or the $223 million ex the $250 million buffer? Or should we think about the cash that you would use for that buy in as a drawdown on the $223 million?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. Okay. So two parts to your question John and you phrased it accurately as usual, in terms of the acquisition, we had a call put, did their options both parties. So we have the option to buy, they have the option to put that starts later in the first half of the year. So, again we don't know exactly what's going to happen as we go forward in the year and we'll keep everyone up to date as those events unwind, so that's the first point.","Second Point is, yes we did pay about $115 million for the 40% interest, can't speculate on what the rest of the 60% interest is, but that probably gives you some level of overall magnitude. Just in terms of the funds to be specific, I would say you'll see that the level of cash that we have at the end of the year is probably relatively high at $473 million so we've taken into account that we have this purchase coming in the future. So we will be purchasing it as we go forward out of that $473 million I would say.","John Nadel","Okay. So that $473 million is growth?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. So we've taken it \u2013 we've taken it into account in the numbers and the capital projections and we're thinking of and repurchases for the year.","Alan Colberg","And John, I would just elevate, elevate from the specific to point to what our long term track record is around capital deployment. We have a business that whatever we earn in the segments on average, we're able to get to the holding company and over 15 years we have consistently used that as the number one thing to return capital to our shareholders to buy back in dividends. So forget, short term things that are going on, that is our long term philosophy and nothing has changed with that.","John Nadel","Yes, absolutely. And then just a follow-up on investment income as well, Richard, obviously, real estate GMB income is lumpy and very difficult to predict, if not impossible. But if we strip that out of your total investment income for the fourth quarter, would you characterize the underlying level of investment income as sort of a reasonable way to think about a run rate? It looks like it was pretty good and maybe it's just benefiting from rates being higher in a shorter duration portfolio turning over a little bit more quickly. Can you just comment on that?","Alan Colberg","Yes. John, let me start and then I'll turn it over to Richard. The way to think about real estate, which is lumpy, is just an alternative asset class within our investment portfolio? So we've made a decision to take some of our investment portfolio and invest in real estate projects. That is, it shows up in a lumpy way, but it does show up consistently over time. So we don't think about stripping it out the way you described it, but I understand where you're going. So Richard, do you want to talk about what's the underlying rate before you add back in something on real estate?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. I think if you look at the kind of the average rates that we've been posting during the previous quarters that gives you a good indication of the overall yield. I mean, yields have moved a little bit, but obviously they went up and kind of now backed down in the markets. The other thing that you have coming in and the total investment income is, when we put \u2013 we added TWG to the portfolio. So obviously that boosts the aggregate amount that we have coming through.","So I wouldn't factor in any sort of quantum steps or leaps in it. It's sort of a natural progression of the portfolio. And as Alan said, as you and your question said, real estate income is lumpy and in 2019, we kind of had most of it in the fourth quarter here.","John Nadel","Yes, yes. I'm not dismissing the real estate income it's very real, it's just that \u2013 it's much more difficult to predict it. And then last one is, Alan, and may be this is more about sort of looking into the March 14 Investor Day. But I think one of the things investors struggle with is trying to model the revenue and margin contribution the differing businesses within Global Lifestyle, the trade-in business let\u2019s say versus the mobile service contract versus the warranty business on the auto side. So you mentioned trade-in volumes were up on a year-over-year basis, I know you don't split out that piece of revenues but may be you can help us understand that a bit more. How much for trade-in volumes up? How much of revenue comes from that business?","May be, how we gauge the contribution from the steady increases in covered devices and covered automobiles those sorts of things and may just be more around your deliverable on March 14, but any color you can provide would be helpful.","Alan Colberg","Yes. John, first of all, I understand the challenges that you ought to work through and trying to understand Lifestyle. The thing we always have to balance is our competitors generally are either private or not disclosing any information about what they're doing. And so it's a balance and we are committed as you've seen over the last few years to provide as much transparency as we can and we will continue to do that. Just specifically in trade-in volumes in Q4, what's really happening is we're adding new programs and we have more subscribers. So even in a market where smartphone sales were sluggish to down, we're growing trade-in\u2019s because of our increasing number of programs in subscribers.","John Nadel","Got it. Perfect.","Alan Colberg","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Alan Colberg","Hey, good morning Mark.","Mark Hughes","Yes, thank you for taking the follow-up. You had mentioned the how in the vehicle business your revenue is driven by sales you've made in prior years. The unearned premium in the Global Lifestyle segment sits at about $14 billion. Could you say how much of that normally would flow through the P&L in terms of revenue for you, is the some portion of that presumably shared off with your partners, your clients and so therefore it doesn't actually flow through your P&L and am I thinking about that properly and if that's the case, how much of that would you expect on your income statement in the future?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, Mark its Richard back. So I guess the $14 billion, I think part of it is reflection of the acquisition with TWG. During the acquisition we really talked about showing, aligning them with our accounting and going from\u2013 going to an accounting that's what we call gross accounting. So the premiums that are paid by the customer come in total to our balance sheet and then the distribution costs, claims are paid out. So as you've kind of stated, I guess implicitly, not all of that those unearned premiums are kind of for us per se. They will all flow through the income statements and P&L\u2019s but a part of them will go through to distribution payments, commissions, claims, et cetera. So it will be a part of that. I think the best thing I would do in terms of giving you guidance on that would be really to look at the kind of the growth trends that we have in the net earned premium that we're showing in the revenues in the auto section and growing those is probably the best indicator as opposed to trying to get into the EPR and what piece because that that's a fairly complex piece And we can start.","Mark Hughes","Yes, understood, I guess I'm trying to get a basic understanding of your global vehicle that are in premium fees and others this last quarter was $670 million but you're sitting on an unearned premium balance of $14 billion and so I'm just trying to do kind of the simple math of how much backlog do you have sitting on your balance sheet and how many presumably years worth of revenue is reflective there as opposed to what's the near-term growth rate, anything like that. I'm just trying to get a feel for the magnitude what that implies for future visibility?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So Mark, if you're willing let's defer that to our Investor Day where we planned to talk a lot more about how to think about the auto business going forward. The important takeaway though is we have a lot of embedded earnings on the balance sheet in auto, which is one of the reasons we have a lot of confidence about how the business is going to grow in the coming years.","Mark Hughes","Right, I think we understand that, I'll take your point to wait on that. But how much embedded revenue is sitting there, how much is yours versus your partner, that's the question, I appreciate your answer on that. One other question was, you had mentioned the lender-placed insurance, some of the underlying losses were higher and others were experiencing that and part of what will help that is rate hike, do you have any kind of assumption or visibility on what the rate hikes you might anticipate over the next year or two within the lender-placed piece?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, what I would say on that is, we're in a good position with the various states at this point. Our discussions with them are based on the facts of the situation and you know we\u2019re warranted based on our experience. We're able to work with them on rates. So I think we feel good about it, its ordinary course. It's an annual process with most states. That's how we think about it.","Mark Hughes","And you wouldn't care to venture mid-single-digits, upper single digits?","Richard Dziadzio","No, no. We would not.","Mark Hughes","Yes, okay. All right, very good. Thank you.","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you, Mark.","Alan Colberg","All right, well thank you everyone for participating in today's call. We're very pleased with our performance in 2018 and looking forward to another strong year in 2019. Our Investor Day on March 14 is coming up soon and we'll share our long-term vision, strategy and we'll go deeper on the key metrics and the way to think about our various businesses. In meantime, please reach out to Suzanne Shepherd and Sean Moshier with any follow-up questions. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does concludes today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi","Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2014 results with you today.","Joining me for Assurant's conference call are: Rob Pollock, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Peninger, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter 2014 results. Both the release and the corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.","We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Rob and Mike, with Chris participating in the Q&A session.","Some of the statements we make on today's call may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in those statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release, as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2013 Form 10-K.","Today's call will also contain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted on assurant.com.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Rob.","Robert B. Pollock","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results were good, despite higher claims at Specialty Property. We made progress deploying additional resources to the areas targeted for long-term profitable growth.","Let me highlight some examples from the second quarter. Our mobile business drove excellent results for solutions. Specialty Property generated solid fee income growth from our recent acquisitions in the mortgage value chain. Health continued to adapt to the Affordable Care Act, with robust sales outside the ACA open enrollment period, and Employee Benefits grew voluntary sales and revenues.","We measure our performance with 3 key metrics: annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 10.8% year-to-date; book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, has increased 5.3%, since year-end; and revenue, defined as net earned premiums and fees, was up nearly 20% year-over-year, driven by expansion across all 4 business segments and contributions from our recent acquisitions.","Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with approximately $560 million of holding company capital. This provides flexibility to make investments in our businesses, pursue select acquisitions, and return capital to shareholders.","Now, I'll provide updates for each of our business segments. Assurance Solutions' delivered record earnings during the quarter, led by Mobile and expense savings from prior restructuring actions. Gains in mobile reflected favorable loss experience and contributions from client marketing programs that exceeded expectations. The number of enrolled devices is up more than 15%, since last year-end. Our program management capabilities provide a broad array of services that clients can tailor to their needs, such as product development, program administration and device management. This expertise allows us to segment mobile consumers and serve their needs.","The mobile industry remains dynamic, as carriers and distributors consider new partnerships and strategies to be successful in the expanding global market. Our progress this year demonstrates our ability to adapt, and we're excited about future opportunities.","In Preneed, we renewed our long-standing relationship with SCI, the leading funeral home provider in North America for another 10 years. This has been a great relationship, and we look forward to continued growth as we benefit from SCI's expanded footprint.","We're pleased with solutions year-to-date results, as the team met performance milestones ahead of schedule. We believe the business is well positioned to deliver 10% average annual growth, and net operating income over the next 3 to 5 years. Contributions from mobile, Preneed and service contracts are expected to offset the clients in our domestic credit and runoff retail businesses.","Assurant Specialty Property's net operating income declined due to a significant increase in non-catastrophe losses, which Mike will discuss in more detail. Underplays revenues continue to be solid. Our growing multifamily housing business, along with our acquisitions in the mortgage value chain are building a more diversified less capital intensive property business going forward.","At Assurant Field Asset Services, we captured additional share of the property preservation market by winning new business. We believe that our strong reputation, rigorous processes and large vendor network were the reasons we were selected.","The StreetLinks integration is well underway and early feedback from clients is positive. We anticipate this property appraisal business will contribute $80 million to $90 million of fee income to Specialty Property's results this year. And we've grown our sales pipeline as a direct result of the acquisition.","While it's still early, both of these acquisitions are exceeding our expectations. Overtime, we anticipate they will generate 15% pretax margins and help sustain attractive returns at Specialty Property.","Let's now turn to Assurant Health. Results reflected the continued impact of health care reform. The new guaranteed issue environment meant that a less healthy population than we traditionally insured would enter the market. The ACA's reinsurance and risk adjusted programs were designed to help mitigate the expected higher claims and were reflected in our pricing. Late changes in ACA rules, however, allowed people to extend coverage under existing plans. This changed the risk pool of ACA enrollees to include fewer healthy lives than we assumed. We expect experience and new enrollees to normalize over the remainder of the year.","The health team is preparing for the next open enrollment period that begins in November. We plan to participate on several public exchanges this year. We expect this new distribution channel will allow us to serve even more consumers with our broad array of products.","Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that fixed indemnity plans, like Assurant Health Access, cannot be sold on a standalone basis beginning in January. Health Access currently accounts for less than 10% of health net earned premiums. While we believe these products meet affordability needs of many buyers, we will discontinue sales as required. Additional business from the public exchanges should more than offset revenue declines from our access products. We're encouraged that our major medical premiums grew in excess of 20% this quarter driven by strong sales, which continued outside of open enrollment. We believe our multichannel distribution, broad network and expense discipline will allow health to deliver attractive returns over the long-term.","Assurant Employee Benefits achieved strong results this quarter, with an ongoing focus on voluntary offerings for the small to mid-sized employer. Voluntary premiums grew by 13% or roughly 2x the rate of the market. We've gained share with our efficient enrollment, communication and billing capabilities combined with our broad product suite. We continue to allocate resources to voluntary, while working to reduce expenses in other nongrowth areas.","Before I turn to Mike, I want to acknowledge the succession plans we announced during the quarter. In addition to my retirement, Mike will retire this year. Chris will succeed him as CFO on August 15. I'd like to thank Mike for his many contributions during his 30-year career at Assurant. He's been a great advisor to me, most recently as our CFO for the past 7 years. I know that Chris will continue to build upon the company's momentum. I look forward to working even more closely with him during my remaining time as CEO.","With that, I'll now turn to Mike for more detailed comments on our second quarter results and outlook for the full year.","Michael John Peninger","Thank you, Rob. It's been a privilege to serve as CFO, and I know that Chris will provide strong leadership as the company executes its profitable growth strategy.","Turning now to our quarterly results, I'll begin with Solutions. Second quarter net operating income was just under $60 million, up almost 90% from the prior year. This increase was largely driven by mobile results, which benefited from double-digit growth in covered devices, very favorable domestic loss experience and $10 million of income from client marketing programs, which generated a significantly higher volume of devices than we anticipated.","Total segment net earned premiums increased 13% and fees were up 76%, due to the global success of mobile, which now accounts for roughly 25% of Solutions' revenue. The domestic combined ratio decreased to 91.4%, reflecting favorable loss experience in fee income from our various mobile offerings. Excluding mobile, the domestic combined ratio for our core protection products trended in line with our long-term target.","Adjusting for prior period restructuring charges, our international combined ratio increased 120 basis points year-over-year and reflected changes in our geographic mix of business. European results improved significantly as cost savings from the LSG integration accelerate in the months ahead, European results should continue to improve. We expect the total international combined ratio to approach our target of 100% for the full year.","Based on Solutions' strong performance in the first half of 2014, we believe that full year operating income will exceed our previous expectations. We do, however, expect some moderation in the third and fourth quarters. Client marketing programs contributed substantially to our first half results but future volumes and profitability are difficult to predict in such a fast-changing market.","Similarly, loss experience in our insured products can vary considerably from quarter-to-quarter and will likely increase from the low levels, we saw in the second quarter.","Looking further ahead, fluctuations in foreign exchange and the evolving mobile marketplace may cause results to vary from year-to-year. We remained confident, however, that Solutions' will achieve its 10% annual earnings growth rate target beyond 2014.","Moving to Specialty Property, net operating income declined by $38 million year-over-year, primarily, due to a spike in non-catastrophe losses. Excluding reported catastrophe claims, our loss ratio was higher by 790 basis points versus the second quarter of 2013. Unusually cold weather earlier this year caused a significant jump in water damage claims from burst pipes, including $22 million of adverse development from the first quarter. These losses, along with an uptick in fire claims, accounted for about 500 basis points of the increase. The balance was consistent with our expectations and reflects the impact of lower premium rates and loss trends associated with our new lender placed insurance product.","Our expense ratio increased by 600 basis points in the second quarter. Growth in fee-based businesses, which have higher expense ratios, costs nearly 400 basis points of the increase. Additional cost in our lender placed insurance business drove the remainder of the change. We expect that our long-term initiatives to standardize and streamline our lender placed platform will yield savings beginning in 2015.","Earlier this month, we announced the completion of our 2014 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program with more than $1.8 billion in coverage. Attractive pricing in the reinsurance market allowed us to lower our first event retention to $190 million versus $240 million in 2013. We also expanded multi-event and multiyear coverage. Complete details of the new program are available on our website.","Given continued growth year-to-date, we now expect properties, premiums and fees to increase slightly versus 2013. As we noted on our last call, we are in discussions with the client regarding possible loss of business to another carrier. We have no further update on these discussions at this time. Profitability at Specialty Property for the year will depend on loss experience, and the rate of change in lender placement rates, including the timing and outcome of our client discussions.","At Assurant Health, pretax profits, which we believe are the most appropriate gauge of underlying performance, totaled $7.5 million in the quarter compared with $12.4 million last year. Results included early claim submissions on Affordable Care Act policies. These policies accounted for more than 1\/3 of Health's total individual medical net earned premiums in the first half of the year.","As Rob noted, initial claims were somewhat higher than our pricing assumptions, but much of that variance will be offset by the ACA's risk mitigation programs. As of June 30, our estimated recoveries from the reinsurance and risk adjustment programs totaled approximately $140 million, about $80 million of that is from the reinsurance component and is booked as an offset to policyholder benefits. The remaining $60 million is the expected risk adjustment reimbursement and adds to net earned premiums. We anticipate that accruals for both these programs will continue to increase as ACA plans become a larger portion of our business.","It's worth noting that reinsurance recoveries are estimated based on Health's historical claim payment patterns and the projected funds available to the industry under this program. The risk adjustment receivables are entirely a function of how the health of our policyholders compares to that of the market and are thus even harder to estimate. We've carefully reviewed our methodology, and the limited market data that's currently available. We believe our assumptions and methods are sound. Nevertheless, actual reimbursements may vary significantly from our estimates. We will update you as experience develops over the rest of the year.","Health continues to demonstrate strong expense discipline. In the quarter, the expense ratio declined 170 basis points due to prior expense actions and greater scale. Expenses also include $5.3 million related to the annual health insurer fee. We're encouraged by continued sales momentum and revenue growth at Health. As we look to 2015, we believe the individual health market will continue to grow and that Assurant Health will generate profits as we benefit from increased scale, improved experience and our ongoing expense discipline.","Employee benefits delivered a strong quarter, driven by improved disability experience, reflecting lower incidence and targeted pricing actions. In addition, the previously announced increase in the discount rate on new long-term disability claim reserves added nearly $1 million to operating income. Voluntary premiums grew by 13%, while our true group business continued to decline as expected.","Employee benefits remains focused on reducing expenses. In the quarter, the expense ratio declined due to net earned premium growth. As a reminder, expenses in the quarter included $1.5 million related to the ACA annual health insurer fee. We expect additional expense management actions, along with premium growth, to further reduce benefits expense ratio longer-term.","Turning to Corporate matters, we ended June with $310 million in deployable capital. During the quarter, we paid $60 million for StreetLinks, raised our dividend for the 11th consecutive year and bought back $59 million worth of stock. Through the remainder of hurricane season, we'll remain disciplined in deploying our capital. We will continue to balance prudent investments to fuel growth with returning capital to shareholders.","Net segment dividends year-to-date totaled $123 million or 42% of segment earnings. For the whole -- for the full year, they will roughly equal segment earnings, subject to factors such as growth in the business and rating agency requirements.","The second quarter corporate segment operating loss was $14 million, a 35% reduction compared to last year, due to lower benefit plan costs and other operating efficiencies. Overall, we're pleased with the quarter and performance so far this year. We continue to make significant progress against the strategic objectives we announced on Investor Day, as we grow and diversify earnings for the long-term. We're optimistic about our future prospects.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Question, I guess for Mike. You've mentioned confidence in achieving the 10% annual growth target in solutions beyond 2014, and you've talked a lot kind of this quarter and last quarter about the favorable experience, but didn't really call them out as disclosed items in the supplement. So I'm wondering if that growth in '15 includes actual year-to-date results? Or if there is some normalization of those client marketing initiatives and favorable loss experience?","Michael John Peninger","No, we have not called those out as disclosed unusual items, Chris. I mean, we were very happy with our mobile experience in the quarter of the year. We do talk, as I mentioned, about variability in these things. They're hard to predict in advance. But overall, mobile is very strong for us. And we also like several other areas have solutions too, which are performing very well, on our vehicle services business. We're excited about the new contract with SCI. So mobile definitely is driving our progress this year. But solutions, all solutions lines, are going very well. We got to keep in mind the declining areas too. But the domestic credit business and the retails channel in the U.S. But mobile plus those other areas we feel good about.","Robert B. Pollock","I think, Chris, if we go back and put this in a broader perspective, we're playing that big macro trends that we see going on in mobile. It's growing, it's growing in lots of different places. We're playing the trend of digitization, which is movement away from the big-box. Some of the things Mike talked about towards other ways of distributing product and we still like the growth in the middle market in Latin America. So those are the macro trends we're playing. Recall too that when we entered mobile, we entered that under an idea of ensuring devices. What we found is the much broader program management that Mike's talked about, which offer lots of different opportunities for us to participate. So we're quite excited about the mobile area.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Understood. Around Health, can you talk a little bit about, what you're thinking about regarding the public exchanges? I know at Investor Day you talked about looking to participate. So any updated thoughts in terms of number of states you're going to target, and how we should be thinking about the discontinuation of the access products? That's an area you have had some success selling into over the past few years?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. So the first thing I think is, if you look at where we were a year ago, we decided to allocate resources toward consumers and agents as they were going through the impacts of health care reform. We also were at the belief that everything we've heard, the exchanges we're going to have, some trouble getting up and operating at the beginning, we didn't think that was the best use of our resources. That turned out to be a pretty good decision. I think things went well. So what are the learnings today. The learnings we found is the exchanges have gotten better, and they're also used by agents as a way to determine who might be eligible for subsidy. So -- although they -- I think the agent will continue to be the guider of the buyer in a lot of these situations, or most of them, they're going to use the exchange as a means to determine if someone can get a subsidy. We're going to make decisions on a state-by-state area based on where we think the best opportunities are, but we do think playing in that arena and demonstrating we can succeed there will be important for us going forward.","Michael John Peninger","Yes, and I think access has been a nice growth product to your point, Chris. But with that going away, we think that the exchange will -- be another source of revenue that will definitely offset that.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then last one, and I'll jump back in the queue. Maybe for Chris around capital and M&A. Obviously, the capital position is strong, continues to build and I don't think you've taken kind of all the dividends out here year-to-date. So I guess maybe even better if given the current kind of pace of buybacks here. So wondering, if you still have some debt capacity here, at attractive rates, would there be any consideration for larger M&A and\/or change in maybe what you've communicated from a share repurchase standpoint?","Robert B. Pollock","Chris, Rob. I'll give this to Chris, because it's really his. But I just want to start with remember, we continue to have businesses that generate a lot of free cash. We think that's a big part of our storyline and what we're trying to do, and it underlies all of our activities around capital management. Chris, why don't you tee that up?","Christopher J. Pagano","Sure. I mean, it does a couple of things. First, again, this is the approach to M&A hasn't changed. We continue to believe that modest sized deals in targeted growth areas are the best source of value creation. We continue to maintain our discipline around cash based internal rate of return, hurdle rates. We do believe we have some debt capacity, probably $250 million to $300 million, just increases the financial flexibility overall. But as Rob said, cash producing operating companies give us significant amounts of, again, flexibility to deploy capital in targeted growth areas organically or through M&A, and then also to return capital to shareholders. We still believe the stock is attractive, and continue to view share repurchase as a prudent use of deployable capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","The $140 million in accruals, would you assume that the second half accruals would be at about the same level? And can you give us some sense of your confidence in the -- your calculations, given the kind of fluidity of the environment in health care?","Robert B. Pollock","Sure, well, the accrual will continue to grow because that the settle up on these things won't take place for a while. But I think it will grow along with our premiums as so-called metallic premiums account for a bigger share of our business, Mark, the accrual will grow along with that. We'll be certainly be reporting out to you in a variety of settings about the progress. To the confidence in these, they're part of the legislation, the ACA legislation. We built them into our pricing. they were designed to make sure that individual carriers were comfortable being in the market. For the most part, well actually, I think they are industry funded. There's money being collected now and then in the case of the risk adjuster, it's sort of a zero-sum industry program. So we're quite confident about that.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you'd -- any update on the savings you'd described when -- the plan to standardize, streamline the platform in specialty property, how meaningful will that be?","Robert B. Pollock","Well, we think it will be quite meaningful -- it's a multi-year plan because of the complexity of the property of business, the complexity of the systems environment that's required to serve our lender placed clients and all, it doesn't happen overnight. But as I think we mentioned, we expect savings to start next year and then they'll build over the next year or 2.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Any sense of the magnitude there? Tens of basis points, hundreds of basis points?","Michael John Peninger","I think as plans get more firmed up, we'll certainly be updating you about that, Mark. But we expect the savings from these initiatives to be meaningful.","Robert B. Pollock","Right. And you can just think about it as representing a lot of changes that have gone on in the marketplace, where historically having a tailored solution was very important to the servicer, with all the requirements that have come about around the compliance aspects of things, a move towards standardization will make a lot of sense. We've identified things to work on in that area. We've had discussions with a number of our clients. They're very receptive. So now, Mark, it's just a matter of execution on the things that we've identified. But it will take time, as Mike mentioned.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Wanted to go into mobile, maybe in a little bit more detail. And the -- I think you mentioned in prepared remarks, maybe Mike's remarks, that mobile today represents about 25% of Solution's revenues. I just want to make sure, is that of the total segment revenues or should we exclude preneeds? Is that just on premiums and fees?","Michael John Peninger","It's the total segment, John.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Including net investment income as well or just premiums and fees?","Robert B. Pollock","No, premiums and fees.","Michael John Peninger","Premiums and fee income.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then thinking about -- can you give us a sense for the split of that between domestic and international? Is it 50-50, 75-25, I mean?","Michael John Peninger","Yeah, I don't think we've provided that split yet, John. We've got contributions from the domestic clients. Notably, we've talked about T-Mobile, we've got a considerable amount coming in from [indiscernible] and Telefonica.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Telefonica. Yes. On the marketing programs fees, I think you mentioned $10 million. Is that 100% margin for you guys? Or is there some expense that you put up against that?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, there's certainly expenses, John. You can think about it as it's a big logistics business. Someone might trade in a phone or send in a phone for repair. We have to work on it, mail it back to them. So there's certainly expenses associated with these things. And the contributions from these programs come in different ways, John. We've talked about the $10 million contribution. But in some cases, because of the different kinds of program we do, sometimes they're accounted for through fees and sometimes they're expense offsets and stuff. So that's why we've tried to help you with that. And we mentioned that the combined ratio on the non-mobile things are trending sort of in line with our historical benchmarks. So I think with this additional disclosure, that can help you sort of figure out how mobile is coming through our financials.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so then -- so $10 million, but it's not entirely $10 million to your pretax income and solutions?","Robert B. Pollock","No, it's a $10 million contribution to NOIs is what we [indiscernible] program. So there's much more combination of things, it's netting to that, John.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So $10 million after tax impact in Solution. Got it. Then -- just a quick one on health. Just, can you give us a sense for the margin differential between the health access product and the major medical -- individual major medical product?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, I think at our Investor Day, Adam went through some of this, John, and outlined that. We're feeling much more confident that we can earn good margins in the traditional major medical business. I'd also point out, remember, we're on a journey here in health. And we said that as we developed our strategy over time, the first thing was to demonstrate as the Affordable Care Act went into business or became fully functional, that we could sell in that environment. I think we're proving we can do that. We know we have some higher expenses associated with commissions on new business. We've had to put resources on getting ready for all these things, and we think profitability will improve over time. And over the long term, we think we can earn attractive returns in the business. So step one, we prove we could do things. This year, we're going to go on the exchange, prove we can sell there. Longer term, we know the profits will follow.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And I'm sorry, I have got 2 more quick ones. Just returning to Solutions real quick. I think this quarter, about $1.7 billion of equity allocated to that business. Obviously some moving parts in terms of what's growing, what's not, how capital intensive that growth is or not. As we look forward, should we expect that, that $1.7 billion is going to grow significantly from here?","Robert B. Pollock","No, I think there's some noise in the inner -- in the quarters, John, because of our complex legal entity structure. So I think if you go back and think about equity as we've got income, we take some dividends out from the segment, there's some growth that's certainly going to drive Solution's equity up. But I don't think it will go up. In fact, it will probably moderate a bit by the end of the year from the $1.7 billion.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, lastly, just in Specialty Property on the lender-placed side, if you think about the impact of rate reduction, specifically in those couple of states where they were pretty meaningful, about how far in the ballgame are we in terms of seeing that fully reflected in your premiums through renewals and new business?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, if you think about it on a state-by-state basis for instance, we're done in California. Those changes were put into effect a couple of years ago, we finished. I think what Gene outlined at Investor Day is we'd have about an 8% to 9% impact over the course of '14 and into '15. Obviously, Florida is a big part of our business. We started taking rate actions in Florida beginning in January of this year. And as business renews, that represents about 1\/3 of our business, John. So there's a timing impact to how these things come through. And we review the stuff regularly on a state-by-state basis with each of the different insurance departments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weiss of Bank of America.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe just to return to Solutions real quickly. In the outlook, you removed $50 million target for the 4Q. I just want to make sure I'm reading this right. Is this because you've already basically achieved that? Or could we read that there's maybe upside to quarterly run rate earnings?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, we feel good about the $50 million in the fourth quarter. We took it out because of the strong quarter we just had. We're sort of already there. We pointed out that you just need to think about a little bit of variance, and we had really good loss experience in the second quarter. Historically, loss ratios have moved around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. And then we talked about the sort of inherent difficulty in predicting some of these marketing programs because they're really under the control of the carriers. The carriers start and stop them. So we just want you to be aware of those things when we think, but overall, we're very pleased with Solutions results.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then thinking about these marketing programs, should we think of the back half of the year where there may be particularly a pressure to what you would otherwise expect that some of those earnings were maybe brought forward due to more accelerated pace of these marketing programs? Or should we just think about a base level there?","Robert B. Pollock","Again, we can't predict what will happen. We do have -- I think other things we've talked about, we've got expense savings going on in all the solutions that will continue to take effect, as we go through the year. A lot of the programs are designed around carrier strategies, and also the introduction in new phones, et cetera, those are difficult things to predict.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I could just shift quickly to Specialty Property. And I believe in the prepared remarks, you talked about an alternate 15% margin on the Field Asset and StreetLinks. Could you give us a sense of where you are now on margins? And maybe also a sense of -- I assume these are much less capital intensive products. Could you give us any sense of what kind of capital requirements those demand?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, I think Chris' presentation at Investor Day tried to address some of that Seth. And I'm going to let him tee up kind of where we are on a number of these acquisitions.","Christopher J. Pagano","Sure. So just one -- a comment, just first about the capital intensity, These are fee-based businesses, so there will be very little additional capital outside of the purchase price. In terms of the investment thesis with these 2 investments, this is mortgage value chain. It's not a market that's growing, but a market where we believe we can gain market share by expanding our product offerings, leveraging our distribution with the -- within the mortgage market and improve the operating margins by efficiencies and synergies by rolling these businesses up into the broader property space. So we feel very good about that. We just keep in mind, though, that we look at these on a cash basis, internal rate of return, hurdle rate basis. There are significant intangibles associated with these 2 purchases. Field Asset Services is roughly $20 million of intangibles that will amortize over the next 5 or so years. The StreetLinks deal is about 75% of that purchase prices intangible. So you're not going to see significant NOI contributions in the early years. But over time, as we assimilate these businesses into Specialty Property, we do believe that they're going to be -- produce long-term profitability and value creation.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So that 15% is looking beyond that amortization period?","Christopher J. Pagano","No well, again, operating margin and NOI, separate discussions there, so -- which again -- so pretax operating margin will be a function of the synergies and the efficiencies. And then, of course, scale as we expand in the out years. So -- but in terms of NOI, you've got to back out intangible amortization, but that again is not a cash -- will not affect the cash generating potential for these businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I have a few here, kind of random. The increase in fee income going to Specialty Property. First, the increase in fee income in the quarter, sequentially from 1Q '14, that is both StreetLinks and Field Asset Services?","Robert B. Pollock","Correct. StreetLinks was -- it came in during the quarter, so that was a meaningful change from first quarter.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. And then something that I track -- I don't know if you look at it this way or not, but I look at gross premium earned to the homeowners business relative to loans insured and that actually picked up a little bit in the second quarter versus the first quarter. I would expect that to decline. Is there a reason, a geographic mix shift or just?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. It certainly, I don't know off the top of my head, but the hypothesis you just offered up could well be a reason, Steven. Yes, I think there's lots of -- sort of the loan counts are point in time snapshots, and it's directionally important but it's not a perfect timing match with our premiums. But I think you're thinking about it correctly. But in the loans, the pricing is going down, as we've talked as we roll out our new product.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Replacement values doing anything?","Robert B. Pollock","I think our average insured values, I'm just trying -- I think they've been pretty level, right.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then moving on. Just some more follow-up on these marketing fees. These are monies paid to you and then you go out and boost up your marketing to get people to buy extended service contracts. Is that the deal?","Robert B. Pollock","No. A little bit different than that. So they can be promotional in nature. They might relate to someone sending us a phone, which we repair and get paid a margin on or it could be that we're actually taking a device and selling it into the secondary market. There's a myriad of different things that could go on there.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But our assumption should be that this $10 million probably goes away?","Robert B. Pollock","No, I just think that it will vary over time. I think that's the big point we're trying to make here is this won't be just a steady state. It will go up some quarters and down others. But, overall, the long-term trend, I think, is this is a positive contributor and demonstrate another place we can participate in profit pools around our overall program management.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes. I realize this is all in the comments, all new, but is this $10 million high?","Robert B. Pollock","It's certainly high given as long as we've been in it, but again, I think you'll see more of these things happening depending on the volumes of our clients being able to attract additional consumers. It may relate to introduction in new phones or devices. A myriad of things can drive it. And I think we'll keep you updated as these things go on. And as Rob said, these are relatively new. So our track -- our history is we have, what, $4 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second quarter. Over time, there's likely to be some kind of baseline that will develop, but it just takes time for that to come out.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just moving onto Solutions. Firstly, the access product. This is a hospital indemnity product?","Robert B. Pollock","The health access product? It's a product that has fixed indemnity benefits, Steven. It can be a variety of different things. But importantly, not have all the benefit requirements of the ACA plan.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I guess the question that I want to ask here is, it has not yet been clear to me -- I think I discussed this with Adam. But the HHS decision, does this affect what we would consider to be, I think, ancillary or supplemental health plans like dental or cancer or anything like that?","Robert B. Pollock","No. All those can be sold in conjunction with a qualified plan. So those can continue on.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can those be -- can those still be sold in conjunction with the non-ACA compliant plan?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, but most of our sales are going to be ACA compliant, with our standard major medical site. Again, on Health Access, I believe the in-force will be allowed to remain in effect too. It will be grandfathered as other plans have, for those who have them.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right, okay. And then, just one more in Solutions. So the accrual from the reinsurance programs and the risk-adjustment programs was $20 million in the first quarter, $120 million in the second quarter. You wouldn't expect $120 million in the third quarter and fourth quarter?","Robert B. Pollock","Well, it's going to grow with the premiums, and the metallic premiums were a much higher percentage of our total premiums in the second quarter than they were in the first quarter, which drove that sort of increase. We're going to tell you, we'll report out regularly on these, Steven, to give you a sense. But they will grow with growth in the premium.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess I'm wondering, was there like some type of catch-up in 2Q as development occurred as you saw what your experience was?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, we were estimating with no experience at the beginning. We had a little, but still a small amount at the end of the first quarter. We have a bigger, but still small amount at the end of the second quarter. I think, and Mike mentioned this, but I think this is important, we're participating in 2 of the 3 Rs. The health insurance fee is set up to cover the reinsurance recoverable, that's the claims between $45,000 and $250,000. So funded, Mike pointed out what we're paying on those fees, but that's being collected from all health insurers of all sizes to deal with issues in the individual market, okay? The risk adjusters is some companies are going to have worst pool of risks, and some are going to have a better pool of risks. Okay. That's a 0 sum game. If you've got a better pool, you pay in. If you've got a worst pool, you're a receiver. We think we're going to be a receiver.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","One more if I may. Just reminded me of this discussion. Torchmark, yesterday, wound up having to take their guidance down a little bit for this Gilead Hepatitis C drug? Is that an issue for you?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, it's an expensive drug. I think they may have -- I can't speak to the specifics of what they're offering. But certainly, we pay a lot of attention to just looking at drug cost because they're something that are causing health care costs to go up, obviously.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Dargan of Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","As we think about the combined ratio in Solutions, domestically, it was the most favorable it's ever been. And I realize there is some favorable loss experience. But can you give us a sense of the seasoning of losses over the life cycle of a handheld device, because you're fairly new to this. When do I guess claims kind of peak?","Robert B. Pollock","Yes. So I think a couple of things first. The movement in that combined ratio has been driven by mobile. But as Mike pointed out, it can report through in the revenue line in the combined ratio. It can also report through as an expense offset in the expense piece. So those will produce slightly different dynamics in terms of just the calculation. Now in terms of the devices themselves, the basic program with the large carriers tends to be reinsured back or can be reinsured back to them. We think we have a long history in understanding the devices that are out there today and how they repair and recognize that in terms of how we look at our results. Could that change on new devices? I suppose it could, but we think we have a good handle on how repairs take place.","Michael John Peninger","Yes, and I think losses come in -- there's not like people have a phone for months and then they have more claims going up. I think it's more if there's variability and we see some seasonal variability and losses due to maybe there's more accidental damage claims. There might be a little bit of theft experience that varies differently on the age of the phone or something like that, but I think in general this stuff develops fairly quickly.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay. And if I remember from last year, there's some I guess negative seasonality in the third quarter. And people go to the beach and the pool...","Michael John Peninger","Yes, we did see that last year and then we saw very good experience in this quarter that just ended that we talk about. So you do see there's some sort of fluctuations.","Robert B. Pollock","Yes, we've certainly attributed that to kids having phones being outside, dropping them in pools in the summer. I mean those are the anecdotes that get offered up, Sean.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. And shifting to property, there was a subtle shift in the language of the outlook, which you mentioned another carrier that this portfolio of loans can go to. I know you said at the beginning you don't want to talk too much about this. But does that mean incrementally you feel stronger that -- or you have a better sense that this portfolio is going to leave?","Robert B. Pollock","I don't think we have anything new to report here. I think, again, we've tried to report as quickly as we knew about the issue, and it's going to play out over time. We'll let you know if and when something happens.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay. You still earned the 20% ROE in property in the quarter. Is there any sense that anyone in Bermuda might want to do this at -- priced at 15% ROE? I mean, have you heard anything about new entrants to this market?","Robert B. Pollock","Again, not -- I haven't looked at it in particular. Again, we've said that there's always been competition in the business. And really the fact that there's a lot of intricacies around the tracking, the compliance, et cetera, are a big part of our strengths in the process. But there's people who, obviously, have -- we're competing with all the time.","Operator","And our final question comes from John Nadel of Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I can't get enough of you guys this morning. It's the first company, first conference call during earnings for me, so I still have energy. A couple of follow-ups on Specialty Property, and I'll follow-up on Sean's question here. I mean is there anything you guys can provide to help us think about the risk to the top or the bottom line if you lose this block of business? Or can you provide any color on why the client is looking to potentially move the business? Is it just a matter of diversifying? Are you seeing some heightened pricing competition? Any color you can provide.","Robert B. Pollock","I think if you go back to Gene's presentation at Investor Day, John. It starts with, \"Hey, this business over time is going to normalize,\" okay? And I think we tried to update all our guidance around what that will look like compared to the prior Investor Day. And I think the things that Gene provided said, is still going to be an attractive business. Probably going to have a little higher placement rate than we had told you last time in the end for a number of reasons. And that we think that we're taking rate actions, et cetera, but we'll still produce attractive but lower returns. I think all of that still is the case. In terms of the particular client, we'll report out if we know anything. But this is normal course action, I think, that can happen at any time within a business. And remember, we've been the net winner of most loan additions over the last couple of years. So again, I don't think this is anything out of ordinary course.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And this is coming up on the normal expiration of an existing contract?","Christopher J. Pagano","We don't really talk about terms of anything that way, John.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So second one for you, and I know this is probably equally as tough to talk about, Rob. But one of the questions I continue to get asked is whether the slower pace of buybacks these last couple of quarters might be related to building up some sort of a cushion in the event of a settlement or something related to the FHFA, who is obviously being at least pushed a little bit here, or at least guided, advised to take some or pursue some legal action against the lender-placed insurers. Do you have any comments there?","Robert B. Pollock","Sure. I always have comments. Again, I think, remember, when we go back and we talk about we introduced our new product, okay, we reached out to the Fannie and Freddie at that time. Talked to them about gee, there've been dislocations in the mortgage marketplace. We're going to try and adjust the product to provide more flexibility to servicers to better respond to their individual portfolio needs. So remember, we gave more flexibility around deductible, coverage amounts on seriously delinquent loans. We looked at area ratings. We did all these things, and we sat down with all the state insurance departments and introduced the new product and made rate changes, where we thought they were appropriate. So I think we've responded to all those issues. I think that we've got that new product operating in 45 states today. And our commitment is to our mortgage servicers, which continues. In terms of Capital Management. Chris?","Christopher J. Pagano","John, I guess I think -- when I think about sort of the pace of buybacks relative to the deployment of capital in organic growth or the acquisition, again, we're focusing on the balance between those 2. We think it's the combination that's going to create value. We still think the stock is attractive. However, as I said at Investor Day, there are other alternatives, both organically and out in the M&A space, that are providing comparable risk return alternatives. If you look at the deployment of capital since the beginning of the year, we've actually returned about $120 million to shareholders via repurchase and\/or dividends and done $60 million of acquisitions. So again, it's this balance. How we think about repurchases from this point on, it's again a function of cat season, the capital needs of the operating companies, the M&A pipeline and what's potentially out there and whether or not deals are going to meet our return thresholds. And then also the pace of segment dividends. Again we still -- as you mentioned earlier, we still got a fair amount of segment dividends still at the operating companies, that will come up during the course of the year. And the deployment will be calibrated accordingly.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. All very helpful. And then final question for you, Rob. So it's been a few months since the announcement of your upcoming retirement. I'm sure the board is taking a really methodical approach here. But should we be interpreting the duration of the process as an indication that you're more likely to bring someone in from the outside, as opposed to promoting someone internally?","Robert B. Pollock","Look, the responsibility on succession is the boards. They've got to process. I think they're following that process carefully. I think, as most of our investors know, we've got a strong talent bench internally here. And the board understands that. They also have a fiduciary responsibility to look outside and what I've kind of pointed out is if they can find a superstar, they're going to bring him in. We've got lots of stars internally. So they're just working through their process, John.","Thanks for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you on our key milestones in the months ahead. Please reach out to Francesca and Suzanne with any additional questions you might have.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants are placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following management's prepared remarks.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Marketing and Communications. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2015 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release, announcing our first quarter 2015 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A.","Some of the statements on today's call may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2014 Form 10-K.","Today's call also will contain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Alan.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. While our first quarter results at Health were disappointing, we are encouraged by solid performance at our other businesses. The results also reinforce the importance of our strategic realignment going forward.","This morning, I want to highlight the opportunities ahead, and then we'll elaborate on the first quarter. Following a comprehensive review of our businesses, last week, we announced our decision to concentrate on specialty housing and lifestyle protection products and services, provided by our Solutions and Specialty Property segments. We believe this sharper focus will enable us to more consistently generate specialty returns long-term.","Accordingly, we're exploring strategic alternatives for Health and Employee Benefits including a sale of both businesses. Given their limited strategic fit in our portfolio and the current market environment, we do not believe they can deliver the returns we require. During this process, we will continue to uphold our commitments to customers, policyholders and employees.","Our housing offerings at Specialty Property protect against risk where people live, through lender-placed and flood insurance, multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. Lifestyle offerings provided through Solutions protect what people purchase and use every day, such as their mobile devices, cars, appliances, as well as their assets which are safeguarded with preneed funeral insurance. Specialty Property and Solutions have track records of sustained industry leadership positions and proven financial performance.","Importantly, these businesses generally deliver specialty returns, generate significant free cash flow, and have the highest profitable growth potential. Looking ahead, we see a broad array of attractive opportunities in housing and lifestyle and plan to build upon our success in the U.S. and abroad. We will do this by further capitalizing on favorable market trends and identifying unmet consumer needs, where we can leverage our core capabilities such as our Advantage distribution networks and strong risk management.","Let me offer a few examples. Mobile continues to transform the consumer experience and we believe there are many opportunities ahead for Assurant. Our Connected Living platform at Solutions allows us to leverage our strengths to create new offerings as consumers are increasingly dependent on staying connected to each other, their devices, and even their homes. With market leading positions in housing, mobile, and extended service contracts, we're in a strong position to capitalizing on these trends and we are already seeing success.","Additionally, we continue to extend beyond insurance to offer other services related to various consumer risk events. Increasingly, we succeed in the market because of our ability to offer these integrated solutions. Our fee-based offerings now account for nearly 20% of Solutions' and Property's total revenues and we expect this percentage to grow over time.","Recently, we expanded our agreement with Claro Brazil, one of the largest mobile operators in Latin America, by adding another smartphone manufacturer to the device upgrade program we introduced last quarter. While early consumer response to this program has been promising, and demonstrates our ability to customize solutions for our partners and strengthen these relationships over time.","Our move into the mortgage solutions business is another example. We brought in our array of property preservation and valuation services through a series of acquisitions that are natural extensions of our collateral risk capabilities.","Our strong processes, technology platforms, and Advantage vendor networks allow us to provide superior customer service for our clients. Since establishing mortgage solutions, we've expanded market share with nine clients that are among the leading mortgage servicers and originators. As a result, we expect the business in total will contribute more than $300 million of fee income this year. These examples demonstrate the momentum we are gaining in areas targeted for growth. We believe a more tightly focused Assurant can enhance long-term shareholder value as we continue to execute on our strategy and align resources toward housing and lifestyle.","Now let me offer some highlights from our first quarter results. Overall, our portfolio of specialty businesses, most notably Solutions and Specialty Property, continued to generate strong cash flow in the first quarter, which allowed us to return $100 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and end the quarter with $570 million of holding company capital. Annualized operating ROE excluding AOCI decreased to 3.9% driven by the loss at Health.","Book value, excluding AOCI, was largely unchanged since year-end. Net earned premiums and fees increased 8%. Our housing and lifestyle products accounted for the majority of our revenue and earnings during the first quarter. Fee income overall increased by 42%, primarily due to our expanded service offerings in mobile and mortgage solutions.","We're excited about the future. We believe our sharper focus will create additional opportunities for profitable growth and strengthen our ability to help people protect what matters most, while also allowing us to realize our aspirations of generating top quartile shareholder returns.","Now Chris will review results for the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions. Segment earnings totaled $54 million, an increase of 10% from the prior year as we expanded our mobile business. We now provide coverage on more than 28 million mobile devices, up nearly 20% year over year. In the quarter, we also benefited from increased handset repair and logistics activity and favorable domestic loss experience.","Results were partially offset by higher integration costs related to our acquisition of CWI Group in France and higher loss experience on a mobile program in Latin America. Total revenues increased 4%, driven by growth in mobile, our vehicle protection business, and at a large domestic service contract client. This was partially offset by foreign exchange pressures and lower production volumes at brick and mortar retailers in North America, trends that we expect to persist for the rest of the year.","In addition, as we mentioned on our last call, we will discontinue a tablet program that represents around $100 million of annualized net earned premiums when it transfers to our client's in-house logistics provider. This will lower earnings beginning in the second quarter. Despite these headwinds, Solutions' overall revenue and earnings this year should remain level with last year. Expansion of our integrated mobile offerings and vehicle service contracts will continue to drive 2015 performance.","Now let's look at Specialty Property. In the quarter, net operating income was $75 million, a decrease from the prior year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. Despite cold winter weather, we incurred lower non-catastrophe losses due to fewer weather and fire-related claims compared to the prior year. Net earned premiums in the quarter declined by $95 million year over year, primarily reflecting the January sale of American Reliable and lower lender-placed premiums.","Placement rates in lender-placed decreased 17 basis points from the first quarter of 2014, but remained flat from year-end, driven by some small loan portfolio additions. Overall, we continue to expect our placement rates to gradually decline as the housing market improves.","Moving to Property's targeted growth areas, we were pleased by the performance of our multifamily housing business, where revenue increased 18% year over year. Fee income more than doubled, driven by mortgage solutions as we increased market share by cross-selling our offerings and adding new clients.","For the quarter, Specialty Property's expense ratio increased by 910 basis points, of which nearly half was due to our shift toward fee-based products and services. Lower lender-placed premiums also contributed to the increase. During the quarter, we continued to implement our expense management initiatives. We incurred a modest severance charge related to staff reductions and made additional investments in our lender-placed platform to reduce our cost structure as the business normalizes. These actions are on track to generate net savings beginning in the second half of the year.","Turning to Health, the net operating loss of $84 million was significantly worse than we anticipated. Approximately half was due to a reduction in our estimated recoveries under the ACA risk-mitigation programs for 2014 policies. We refined our accruals to take into account market data available since year end and additional claims development. This change was reflected in our first quarter results. The balance of the loss was driven by elevated claims on 2015 policies which were only partially offset by risk-mitigation programs. For the first quarter, we accrued $64 million related to the risk adjustment program for 2015 policies.","Recoverables under reinsurance totaled $56 million for the period, and we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk corridors. While we're eligible to participate in this program, we believe this is a prudent measure given that funding has not yet been authorized.","To further manage risk, we reduced commissions in January. As a result, individual sales dropped 15% from the prior year despite significant market growth. Despite rate actions taken, initial claim submissions on 2015 policies indicate that loss experience on our ACA in-force block will remain elevated throughout the year.","ACA policies now account for 60% of Health's premiums compared to 18% last year. Quarterly results will vary based on loss experience and the estimated recoveries for the risk-mitigation programs. We expect insurance carriers will be notified by June 30 of final payment amounts related to the 2014 business, and any changes in current estimates will be recorded in our second quarter results. The process to explore strategic options for Health is well underway.","Absent a sale, we will begin the process to exit the market and will not participate in the 2016 ACA open enrollment. We will provide updates as we can. In the meantime, we remain focused on mitigating losses and prudently managing capital as we work through this process.","At Employee Benefits, first quarter earnings declined to $10 million, primarily due to lower real estate joint venture partnership investment income. Disability results were less favorable reflecting lower recoveries and the discount rate change implemented last quarter. Benefits expense ratio decreased 80 basis points due to premium growth and savings realized from previous expense actions. We view our enrolment capabilities and broad suite of voluntary products and services including dental to be unique in the market. As we explore strategic alternatives for the segment, we believe these will be viewed as valuable assets for any benefits-focused organization.","Moving to Corporate, we ended March with $320 million of deployable capital. Total segment dividends in the first quarter, net of infusions were $55 million. We continue to expect 2015 segment dividends to approximate segment operating earnings as capital releases from lender-placed insurance offset capital needs in other product areas. As always, this is subject to rating agency requirements.","During the first quarter, we returned $19 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and we repurchased $82 million worth of stock. In April, we repurchased nearly 670,000 more shares for $41 million. Year-to-date, we've retired 3% of total shares outstanding. We continue to believe the stock is attractively priced. The proceeds from expected transactions will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital prudently through share buybacks, common stock dividends, and investments in housing and lifestyle.","The corporate loss for the quarter declined to $4 million due to a reduction in tax liabilities, which will reverse during the course of the year and lower employee-related benefits expenses. We still expect our full year 2015 corporate loss to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million. We will assess other opportunities to accelerate expense management efforts as we realign the organization toward housing and lifestyle.","For the balance of the year, our focus remains on repositioning the company for profitable growth and successfully managing potential transactions for Health and Benefits. We believe the actions underway across Assurant will help build a stronger future for the company.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Good morning, Seth.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on the philosophy of capital deployment while you're in this disposition stage of these two businesses, could you just philosophically walk us through how you're thinking about capital deployment in the next, call it, four quarters to six quarters, while there is uncertainty about how much capital Health may need, and of course uncertainty about how much you'll generate from those businesses?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Seth. Let me start. This is Alan, and then Chris can add a few other comments. I think, we're going to continue the same capital management approach that we've had, which is a disciplined and balanced deployment of capital between returning capital to shareholders and investing in the future of the company. And I think, you saw the first quarter is a good example of that. We ended the quarter with essentially the same amount of capital that we started. We have $320 million of deployable capital still on hand. We still expect segment dividends to approximate what we're going to earn in the segments. We returned capital. We still think the stock is attractively priced. And so I think, it's business as usual as we go through the next few quarters.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, I think, couple more things to add. Again, we are assessing the intrinsic value of the stock relative to the share price, and we think, share repurchase is a prudent use of capital. So, we're going to continue to do that. But we also think that, again, this is combination of returning capital to shareholders and investing in profitable growth opportunities in the housing and lifestyle sectors that's going to create long term shareholder value. So as Alan said, this \u2013 or as we think we've been consistent in the last five years, six years with our capital deployment process. It's worked quite well for us and we see no reason to change it now.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. And if I could ask question also on Employee Benefits, you mentioned value proposition to the market. If we look at Employee Benefits segment ROEs over the last two years or so, they've been in this mid to upper single digit level trailing some of the pure-play group provider peers and trailing was low to mid-teen double-digit ROEs if we go back several years ago. What's been the pressure there aside from low rates which everyone seems to be dealing with?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. A couple of thoughts on that, Seth. I mean, I think, we feel very good about the Employee Benefits business and franchise. They do have really strong and unique capabilities, and we've been investing heavily over the last many years now, especially the last three years, four years to really build out the voluntary business and capabilities in the dental. We think those are very attractive assets and for a owner more focused on healthcare and employee benefits, it used to be a very positive addition to another company, but that's really been the pressure, somewhat investing, somewhat we've been in the low interest rate environment as well, which puts pressure on the earnings of that segment.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Mark.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning. In the specialty housing business, how would you describe the underlying growth if you take out the lender-placed business, what should we anticipate in terms of organic expansion in coming years?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we have several different businesses under Property. In addition to the one you mentioned, we have multifamily housing. You've seen how well we've grown that business and we've continued to have double-digit growth now for multiple years in that business, and we expect to continue to grow. There's a significant opportunity to penetrate that market further, gain share in that market. We've created a new growth engine for us over the last few years called mortgage solutions. We see very robust growth for us, as we leverage our capabilities and our distribution to expand our footprint in that business. And then finally, in flood, we are one of the market leaders in flood and we've seen good growth in flood in the last couple years. So we see pretty strong growth in all the other lines, beyond lender-placed.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. The other thing I'd point out just in particular on mortgage solutions is that the investment thesis and our thought process around investing in that space was not about growth in market, but growth in market share, leveraging our position as a trusted advisor, expanding product offerings to the existing client base, as well as gaining new clients, and we're seeing that happening already.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","If you take those discrete businesses, is that double-digit growth within those three, high single-digit?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, I think, well, originally when we acquired those businesses within the mortgage solutions space, it was roughly $250 million of revenue. We expect $300 million of revenue this year. The other thing we expect is expanding operating margins as we leverage scale, and then of course multifamily housing has got smaller but double-digit revenue growth, which again meets our investment criteria.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, good, thank you. And then the lower production in the bricks and mortar, could you give us a sense of the magnitude on that? Has that trend changed over the last quarter? What's driving it? Is it a macro issue, is it company specific?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, what we've seen in retail for quite a few years now has been a gradual decline in the bricks-and-mortar distribution being more than offset by growth in other channels, whether that's through other forms of retail like digital or through OEMs. It's really a macro trend that we've been expecting, and we've been investing against over the last many years, and as you heard Chris say or I think we say in the outlook, our view is Solutions is still going to be consistent with last year despite the various trends going on.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Jimmy.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Jimmy.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So I had a couple of questions. First, on the Health business, I think there's around $440 million of capital in that business. So, assuming that you're not able to sell the Health division, then how much of the capital do you expect to be absorbed as you're winding the business down, and would you expect some of the capital to be freed?","And then, secondly, on the Employee Benefits sale, assuming that you are able to sell it at some point over the next year, do you expect to use a majority of the proceeds for buybacks, and how fast would you buy back if that's the case, or would you be more balanced and wait for potential deals and not speed up buybacks immediately after the deal? Just trying to assess potential dilution from the sale of the Employee Benefits business and the wind-down of the Health business?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Jimmy. Let me start and then, Chris, you can add on this one. I start by the future for Assurant, which we're very excited about. The businesses that we have in housing and lifestyle generate very good returns. There is a leadership position, strong growth potential, both organic and again additional, very selective acquisitions. So I start with, we're very excited by the future.","For Health and then for Employee Benefits, we're really running two different processes. So with Health, as we've said very clearly, we are attempting to sell the business, and absent a sale, we will move to exit that business. Employee Benefits, we are highly confident in a sale for that business. We believe that there are many attractive capabilities that buyers will value. So, we have robust, thorough processes running for both. It is too early to really speculate on what might come out of those processes. What I would say, though, is go back to where we started in the Q&A. We have a disciplined, capital management strategy, which we've been following for years. We're going to continue to follow. Chris?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, again maybe just some \u2013 couple specifics on Health in particular. Absent a sale, we will not be open for 2016 open enrollment. So what we do expect is to be substantially out of the Health business by the end of 2016. So while we enroll for 2015 and through that process we will appropriately capitalize the business, but then expect by the end of 2016 to have gotten significant, if not all the capital out.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then do you have an idea or could you give us some numbers on how much corporate overhead is allocated to Health and to Employee Benefits that would still stay with the company at least initially and would need to be allocated to other businesses?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, again it's early in the process, but as we go through the sale process of Health and Benefits, we are reassessing the corporate infrastructure and our operating efficiencies, and we'll address the issue of stranded cost during that time.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, John.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hey, John.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Hey, good morning, Alan; good morning, Chris. I guess a couple of questions and \u2013 two quick ones. I'll start, two quick ones on the lender-placed business. First, as far as premium rate reductions go, can you just give us a sense for how much of those expected reductions, the ones that have already been approved state by state, how much of those are already now in the premium numbers as of first quarter? And how much more would you estimate is left to roll into the numbers as we move through the remainder of this year?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, I think in terms of what's already in the numbers, I think, you're looking at roughly a 7% rate reduction that's reflected. There's always ongoing rate reviews...","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Yeah.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","\u2013 on an annual basis, ongoing dialog with the states, which may affect the rate reductions going forward. Keep in mind, we're also making some changes around the infrastructure, operational efficiencies in response to the normalization of lender-placed, so again lots of moving parts there, but I think roughly 7% of call it virtually all of the rate reductions from last year are now in the numbers.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","And the total you had expected would roll through it, again understanding that state-by-state these things can change, but the total that you had expected I think was 8% to 9% or something along those lines, so you're pretty close, right?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","That's right, full-year 2015, 8% to 9%.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","And then as I think about the comment I believe that you made, Chris, about the 900 basis points or 9 percentage points increase year-over-year in the expense ratio about half of that just being the growth of the fee-based businesses and half of that being the reduction in lender-placed premiums and I guess negative operating leverage there. How much of that piece of it once the expense initiatives are completed, do you think you can recover?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, couple things, again, increased higher expense ratio associated with the fee business, it's important to remember that there's no loss ratio associated with that business. So again -","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Understood.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","\u2013 an important distinction there. We do think sort of the insurance expense ratio is going to be in the mid-40s percentage over the long-term combines in sort of 85% to 90% I think is sort of the longer term projection we've got there. A lot of that is going to be dependent upon our ability to standardize and create greater efficiencies around the lender-placed infrastructure, which we are now net investors, the first half of the year. We expect to be net savers in the second half and in the out year. So we'll keep pace with the normalization of lender-placed. And at the end we think we're still going to have a 20% ROE business which definitely meets our definition of specialty.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Yeah. Understood. And then also one last one related to lender-placed and then I have one on Solutions. You mentioned a couple of smaller loan portfolios that came onboard that maybe is masking the placement rate underlying falling. Can you give us a sense for how much \u2013 can you do that math? Do have the data to be able to do the math on how much the placement rate would have fallen had you not had a few portfolios come on board?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Just qualitatively, John, they are small loan portfolios with high placement rate. I think, the challenge on quarter-over-quarter placement rate and premium linkage is always a challenge. I think, the longer term 17 basis point decline year-over-year is a better indication, and again this trend towards 1.8% to 2.1% over the long term is really, we still see that trend in place.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then last one for you is just thinking about in the international piece of Solutions, if I look at the last couple of quarters obviously particularly weak combined ratios, even the trailing 12 months the combined ratio is 102%, maybe 102.5%, something along those lines. I know from years ago the target was to ultimately get this business down to the mid-90%s. What is going wrong there? And I guess, Alan, how long should we expect it to take for this particular piece of Solutions to get to its targeted ROE, because it seems like that's the piece of Solutions that's preventing the overall segment from hitting its target?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, you know, I think we feel like there's been good progress in international. We see lots of opportunities to continue to expand our offerings there and become more integrated around the risk event and be more than just insurance. As Chris was talking about, we do have some noise sometimes in the short-term and we had a couple one-timers around integration cost in the quarter that affect the quarter, but we still feel like there's good progress and we are moving forward toward the returns that we expect in international.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","And just like, as we think about that, you have some intangible amortization obviously running through there too...","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Over the next couple of years, how much should just the wind down assuming no incremental acquisitions, which I guess is probably a bad assumption. But assuming based on what you have today, how much should just the wind down of intangible amortization help that ratio?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, I don't have the breakdown international versus domestic. I'd tell you in general, the acquisitions we've done in 2013 and 2014 in Specialty Property and Solutions, it's roughly $40 million to $45 million of intangible amortization on a pre-tax basis. And again, you're right to point that out because what we're focused on is cash and that's going to be a non-cash drag on operating income, but doesn't affect how we think about the business and how the investment thesis and how we value the acquisitions initially.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Sean.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Sean.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thanks and good morning. I have a question about how to think of your thought process as you either sell or exit these businesses and deploy the capital that's freed-up. Is your driving force going to be to make up for those GAAP earnings that were lost or do you want to show EPS growth or is your focus on increased cash flow generation. I'm just wondering how to think of the company and how you are thinking of the puts and takes of share repurchase versus M&A.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So, let me start broadly on that and then answer specifically, I mean the intent of refocusing the company around housing and lifestyle is to create a more attractive company for our shareholders. That comes from a few different points. One is we have a proven track record in those areas of generating specialty returns long term. Virtually every business that is part of the future of Assurant were a market leader ,and that's something we can build off of. Almost everyone of those businesses we're doing more than just insurance.","We have integrated offerings around the risk event, which allow us to have better duration with partners, better economics for us. In general, these are less capital-intensive businesses and so what we really are focused on is free cash flow generation. That gives us the power to create value for our shareholders through the capital deployment. And as we looked across our portfolio by far the highest profitable growth potential we have is in these areas of housing and lifestyle really leveraging the consumer trends, the market trends, et cetera.","And one of the things that we're going to do later this year, as we refocus on the future of Assurant and we get the Health and Benefits transitions behind us. We will put out new metrics and new disclosures and we'll hold an Investor Day late this year to really help everyone understand how to think about Assurant going forward. But we're very excited about the opportunities ahead and we think we're going to generate more cash flow in the future, not less.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's all I had.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Good morning, Steven.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Steven.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. A couple \u2013 just to follow-up on John's question vis-\u00e0-vis LatAm, I think, Alan, you referenced or maybe it was Chris, I don't remember, referenced a \u2013 in a county in Latin America that performed poorly during the quarter, my sense was that was on the loss side, but then you referenced integration costs. So, I was just wondering about the story on that account?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, yeah, so, there are a couple things. So the mobile client in Latin America, there were some issues with a higher repair and replacement cost, product availability. This happens from time-to-time, one of the benefits of having partnerships is that we are able to make adjustments to pricing terms and conditions in conjunction with our partner and return to profitability, which we expect to \u2013 target profitability, excuse me, which we expect to happen over the next one or two quarters. The one-time integration costs are related to the acquisition of the CWI Group. So that's Europe, again mobile, but Europe. So which is a one-time, not repeat. So you'll see the combination of the one-timer and then the return to target profitability in the Latin American mobile client will help improve the combined ratio.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Has new pricing already been worked out with the client in Latin America?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, all of the changes in terms of terms and conditions and pricing have all been finalized. Correct.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Okay. And then moving on to Health, just a quick couple. In the quarter's results \u2013 a quarter obviously negatively affected by what I would call negative prior year development of your government repayment assumptions, I guess. But absent that, I was wondering if there was some type maybe of a premium deficiency reserve or something like that. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, whether you've reserved to try to get that income down to zero, the losses down to zero, or should we still be thinking about losses running much higher than previously?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So the loss reflects changes in estimates around 2014 risk-mitigation programs and then also estimates around the 2015 program. Again, very early in the process with respect to 2015. In particular as you think about the risk adjustment mechanism, we have some information about our own block but have no information on the market yet. And then, we expect to be told at the end of June what the actual reinsurance recoverable and risk adjustment amounts will be from our 2014 block. So still very early in the phase for 2015 and we'll know by the end of the second quarter hopefully what the 2014 actuals will be.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Want to follow up on that. Just so I understand this. So the risk adjustment benefits that you accrued in this quarter if everything goes according to your thoughts, okay, big assumption, but if everything goes according to your thoughts, is there no more of these accruals to be expected? Is that how that works?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So there are two blocks of accruals. The first of the accrual's around the 2014 policies. Those are -","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Forget those.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Okay.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just talking about 2015.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Okay. So 2015, so we for the \u2013 the risk adjustment mechanism we accrued $64 million, and we will continue to accrue throughout the course of 2015. And then as we sit here, a year from now, we'll be waiting for final amounts around the 2015 policies in mid-June of 2016.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I guess what I'm asking is, is it accrue as you go as premiums are earned, or do you accrue upfront and then change over the year?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","No. The quarterly estimates will be accrued as we incur claims.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other important point I would make is there are really three programs now that we're eligible for because of having sold on exchanges for the last open enrollment, we're eligible for the risk corridor program as well. We took a prudent approach there, which is we did not book a net recoverable on the risk corridor.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. That hasn't been funded yet. Okay. And then one more, just on Health. The $300 million, call it $400 million of GAAP equity that you report on page 4 of the supplement, does that roughly approximate statutory equity \u2013 statutory capital?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","No. The GAAP equity is slightly higher. I think, if you look at the year-end numbers, we had $440 million of GAAP equity, and I believe stat capital was right around $400 million.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Devine from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Colin.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Colin.","Colin Wayne Devine - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Two questions. With respect to Health and Employee Benefits, are you also exploring an option of selling them as a package?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. We're not. We're running separate processes. The processes are very robust and very thorough. But we fundamentally believe the buyer universe is very different for those two businesses, and so they are completely separate. We also think that approach maximizes value for our shareholders. And one of the reasons why we announced this when we did was to ensure the widest possible participation in the sale of both of those businesses, but they're completely separate processes.","Colin Wayne Devine - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then second, I didn't catch it in your comments, but I was wondering if you could just give us an update on really how CWI is proceeding according to your expectations, as well as the eMortgage Logic? If I remember on the latter, I think, you were expecting about $250 million potential fee income this year and how are we moving towards that?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, on the eMortgage Logic, so again that's part of the broader mortgage solutions initiative. The combined revenue of the acquisitions at the point of time was roughly $250 million. We expect about $300 million this year. We do expect also some margin expansion. We're having success cross-selling, leveraging our distribution as a trusted advisor and selling products on the appraisal and property preservation and broker price opinion side into the same clients, so really executing right according to plan there. CWI, we're still in the midst of integration again with \u2013 the LSG team is driving that. We do think that that's going according to plan and will give us a nice footprint in Europe around global mobile.","Colin Wayne Devine - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Then following up, you highlighted in the press release that net earned premiums from Solutions and Specialty Property were up 3% taking out American Reliable, but if we also back out the acquisitions to really get at a same-store basis, how are the businesses you \u2013 what you've got this year doing compared to last year in terms of premiums? Thanks.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't have that in front of us. What we've been focused on is we do have strong organic growth in many parts of Solutions and Property, and the fee income, a lot of that in mobile is organic. But I don't have that in front of me. We do feel good though about the future growth potential of the companies and the businesses that are part of the Assurant of tomorrow.","Colin Wayne Devine - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, John.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hey, John.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Two quick ones. So I guess, we've sort of danced around a little bit in international solutions loss in LatAm and the integration cost. I mean, would you at least give us a sense for the combination of what those two factors together cost the business either in combined ratio points or dollars, or something along those lines?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, I think, in terms of the one-timer we're talking about mid-single digits millions pre-tax and then probably $2 million to $3 million pre-tax in terms of the client replacement cost and re-contracting in mobile in LatAm.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Perfect. That's helpful. Thank you. And then the second question is just, you've got these processes ongoing now around the potential sale of these two businesses. Is it fair for us \u2013 I assume it's fair for us to think about you operating your capital management program under a sort of automated program at 10b5 or whatever it's called, such that as you become aware of critical information, material information around these deals, you are still able to be in the market buying back your stock, is that fair?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, with the way we go about share repurchase is 10b5-1. And the activity in April was all during a blackout on all part of the 10b5-1 program. So, continued again, think the stock is attractive, want to be in the market consistently, and have ample financial flexibility to do that.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Okay, thank you. And Alan, appreciate your commentary about an Investor Day and maybe some additional disclosure and metrics around the two key businesses going forward. I think that would be very helpful. Thank you.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, certainly.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the floor will be opened for your questions following management's prepared remarks.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Executive Vice President, Chief Communications and Marketing Officer. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi - EVP, Chief Communication and Marketing Officer","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and year end 2015 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only in net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income.","We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results until the sale of that business is closed.","Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com.","We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris, before moving to Q&A.","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2014 and upcoming 2015 Form 10-K.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Alan.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in the fourth quarter fell short of our expectations and is disappointing. Results were marked by profit declines in both mobile and lender-placed insurance, as well as some unusual items, which Chris will detail later. We are taking actions to address this weaker short-term performance, as we execute our multi-year transformation, and continue to deploy capital to create long-term value for shareholders. While 2016 will be a transitional year, we are confident the underlying potential of our core housing and lifestyle businesses is strong.","During 2015, we made significant progress to realign our strategic focus and position Assurant for long-term profitable growth. For example, the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits to Sun Life Financial will provide Assurant with about $1 billion of net proceeds, including capital releases, and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter. The exit of our health insurance operations remains on track. All of our Affordable Care Act, or ACA, individual major medical policies lapsed as of January 1, 2016. This allows us to accelerate the wind down and begin to release the capital that supports that business.","During the fourth quarter, we also focused on the go-forward organizational framework that will support profitable growth. We're realigning talent, and moving to an integrated enterprise operating model to be more agile and cost efficient worldwide. The external searches for Chris' successor as CFO and for a Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead. We expect to fill these roles in the coming months. Once leaders are in place, we will further integrate their respected teams resulting in better coordination and greater efficiencies over time. All of these steps are critical in our multi-year transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future.","Now I'll offer some business highlights, both for the quarter and the year, which reinforce our confidence in the future. At Assurant Solutions, we continued to strengthen our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect more than 29 million devices worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we introduced new upgrade in device buyback programs for Telef\u00f3nica in Spain and expanded our relationship with their Movistar brand in Chile.","While the contribution from these new relationships are initially small, they are important drivers in the global expansion of our Connected Living business and will help us to deliver 10% average annual growth in earnings long-term. We recognize the growth also will require additional investments, both in the U.S. and Internationally.","As an example, last year, we increased our staff significantly within our repair and logistics operations. This allowed us to process more than 8 million mobile devices in the U.S. Investments in our capabilities and infrastructure will be critically important to increase capacity and capture share in this dynamic market.","At Assurant Specialty Property, we made significant progress transforming our lender-placed platform as that business normalizes. These efforts will help us maintain our strong customer service and leadership position while we also generate savings in 2016 and beyond. We're especially pleased with the contributions of our targeted housing businesses, where we continue to leverage our deep industry expertise, and capabilities to increase revenue and profitability. For example, multi-family housing revenue increased 22% in 2015 and accounted for $280 million of premiums and fees. We increased our share of wallet with Affinity Partners and added several new national property manager relationships. Similarly, our mortgage solutions business captured share, and generated nearly $290 million of fee income for the year.","Currently, we provide valuation or property preservation services to seven servicers of the top 10 servicers and five mortgage originators of the top 10 mortgage originators. We believe, there are a significant opportunities to cross-sell additional offerings and grow with existing and new clients. In the year ahead, we will continue to invest in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions as targeted areas for growth. In both of these businesses, we are well positioned for the future.","Now, I'll highlight overall results for full year 2015, which exclude the health runoff operations. Operating ROE, excluding AOCI was 11.3%, reflecting lower earnings especially Property and Solutions. Total revenue for 2015 was $7.3 billion, a 4% decrease from 2014. Despite this decline, we're pleased that our targeted growth areas including mobile, multi-family housing and mortgage solutions now account for $1.6 billion of revenue, a 16% increase from 2014. These constitute primarily fee-based or capitalized businesses that complement our specialty risk offerings.","In 2015, we also continued to generate strong cash flows driven by Specialty Property and Solutions which provided approximately $600 million of dividends, or almost 120% of their combined earnings. This allowed us to invest in our housing and lifestyle offerings, capitalize the wind down of health, and still return $380 million to shareholders.","Looking ahead, we are focused on executing our transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future. This year, we expect to complete our portfolio realignment and establish our new organizational framework. The ongoing normalization of lender-placed declined to non-growth areas, and variability in foreign exchange will, however, present headwinds. We are taking additional steps to position the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond. The proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits, dividends from health, and cash flow from our ongoing businesses will provide significant financial flexibility.","With this capital, we'll be able to fund meaningful investments to build our global lifestyle and housing offerings, and continue to return capital to our shareholders. We are also identifying opportunities to increase operating efficiencies. Last month, for example, we announced within Assurant that we are freezing our pension plan effective March 1. This action will generate annual pre-tax savings of about $35 million. In addition, we will take other actions to integrate our support functions and further streamline our operations to reduce expenses over time.","I want to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to our strategic transformation. In a short period of time, we have made significant progress. And while there is more work ahead, I'm proud of what we've accomplished and I'm confident in our future.","And now, I'll turn to Chris, who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions. Net operating income totaled $30 million, a $29 million decrease from the prior year. Nearly two-thirds of the decline was driven by weaker than expected mobile results. This included the loss of the tablet program referenced in prior quarters and $6 million of hire expenses to support existing programs and new launches expected this year.","These factors along with lower production from North American retailers and continued run-off in the credit business also contributed to poorer performance in the quarter. In addition, Solutions fourth quarter included a few unusual items. We recorded $8 million of prior period accounting adjustments related to the overstatement of mobile inventory and account receivables in our legacy warranty business. This represented a cumulative adjustment with no material impact to any previous periods.","Foreign exchange also created a significant headwind in the quarter, including foreign exchange losses on intercompany balances with both Latin America and Europe. The accounting adjustments and foreign exchange losses were nearly offset by a year-over-year decrease in legal reserves following a preliminary decision of an outstanding UK regulatory matter.","Turning to revenue. Solutions revenue was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Premiums were down modestly due to foreign exchange pressures, the loss of the tablet program and declines in run-off business. Fee income now nearly 25% of Solutions quarterly revenue, increased significantly as we expanded our mobile administration and repair offerings. Looking ahead, despite recent weakness, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of Solutions. Based on current estimates, we expect earnings growth in 2016. This will, however, be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, due to the launch of new mobile programs, improved international profitability, and additional expense initiatives.","Next, let's look at Specialty Property. Excluding the divestiture of American Reliable or ARIC, net operating income, decreased $7 million to $58 million. Results reflect the ongoing normalization of lender-placed, the previously disclosed loss of client business, and an increase in legal expenses. This was partially offset by lower reinsurance costs due to our declining exposure, as well as favorable non-cat loss experience.","Also excluding ARIC, fourth quarter net earned premiums were down 8% from 2014, primarily due to a 30 basis point decline in the placement rate, which includes the previously disclosed loss of client business. While overall revenue at Specialty Property decreased, targeted growth areas contributed $157 million of premiums and fee income in the quarter, up 22% from last year, driven by mortgage solutions and multifamily housing.","For the quarter, Specialty Property's total expense ratio increased 670 basis points year-over-year. Around 570 basis points of the change was driven primarily by lower premiums and higher legal costs related to outstanding matters. The remaining 100 basis points is due to growth of the fee- based business. Total expenses in absolute dollars declined modestly year-over-year, reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives already under way. We expect additional savings in 2016, as we further transform our lender-placed platform, including the implementation of new technology to further enhance efficiency and customer service.","With the continued normalization of lender-placed, we expect additional reductions in Specialty Property's revenue and earnings this year. Actions are under way to transform our operating platform and diversify our mix of business, which will help us maintain attractive returns.","Turning to employee benefits, fourth quarter earnings increased to $15 million driven by favorable disability and life experience. Net earned premiums and fee income increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter 2014, as growth in voluntary more than offset expected declines in true group disability.","As Alan mentioned, we expect to close the sale of this business by the end of the first quarter. We have received a majority of required state regulatory approvals and are moving toward closing. At health runoff operations, the segment reported a fourth quarter net loss of $16 million, in line with our estimates. This included $11 million in severance related costs and other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves. During the quarter, we had a $250 million net infusion into health to ensure adequate levels of statutory surplus, and fund estimated exit-related charges and claims through the wind-down process. We now expect to dividend $475 million from health during 2016, with additional modest dividends expected in 2017. This is subject to regulatory approval, any significant changes in claims experience, and the final payments from the 2015 risk mitigation programs. So far, preliminary claims development in January for 2015 policies continues to track our estimates.","As of December 31, we received all expected cash payments for the 2014 ACA risk mitigation programs. For 2015 policies, we booked an additional $150 million in the quarter, related to the reinsurance and risk adjustment programs. This brings the total amount accrued to $522 million. Reimbursements for 2015 recoverables will be paid in various installments starting at the end of March.","Moving to corporate, we ended 2015 with $210 million in deployable capital. During the fourth quarter, we paid $33 million in shareholder dividends, reflecting our increased payout, and we repurchased $74 million worth of stock. Overall for the full year 2015, the company repurchased 4.2 million shares or nearly 6% of our common stock outstanding. This year, through February 5, we've repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for $90 million.","We believe the stock remains attractively priced. Based on our current estimates, 2016 dividends from Assurant Solutions and Specialty Property should approximate total segment operating earnings. In addition, proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits and dividends from health will provide us with nearly $1.5 billion of deployable capital for the benefit of shareholders. As always, all dividends are subject to rating agency approval.","The corporate loss for the quarter increased $11 million to $31 million, reflecting an expected reversal of a tax benefit recorded in the first half of the year as well as $3.5 million of severance and other strategic repositioning costs. This year, we expect the corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We will work to eliminate residual expenses from health and employee benefits, and implement other initiatives so that we can exit the year at a lower run-rate.","For Assurant overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy and positioning housing and lifestyle for profitable growth long-term. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, John.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, John.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, everybody. I have a couple of questions. I wanted to think about the expense ratio in Specialty Property and how we should think about that trending. I know you highlighted that the majority of the year-over-year increase in the expense ratio was driven by the insurance business, the lender-placed business. Some of that driven by the decline in revenue, but some of that as a result of an increase in legal cost. Can you give us some sense as we head into 2016, what you think a core or underlying expense ratio was for the year 2015 that we should be trending off of?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, John, let me start and offer a few perspectives and then Chris, maybe you can go a little deeper, if appropriate. The way we think about the quarter, first of all, for Property is pretty much as expected given the normalization in the lender-placed it's ongoing. We've talked about the progress we've been making transforming that platform and investing to really create the best platform and the best offering in the industry, and we see that progressing well and we still are confident that that insurance expense ratio longer term will be in the mid-40s as we've said previously.","On the legal cost, these are related to the multi-state and outstanding litigation, ongoing matters, we continue to cooperate. And at the moment, we feel appropriately reserved for everything we know on those matters. But that's how I think about where we are with lender-placed.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. So, longer term if we think about the lender-placed business, we can still think about the mid-40s?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And then if I turn to Solutions, obviously fourth quarter was weak but the full year looks like it was a pretty good year. Some one-time items may be impacting the domestic and potentially even the international combined ratios, if I look at those ex- (21:32). Similar question is the Specialty Property question, if we look at the combined ratio domestic and international in Solutions for the full-year 2015 \u2013 how should we think about what you think about as the underlying core level off of which we ought to be trending as we look out to 2016 and beyond and I assume in both cases you would expect \u2013 both of the combined ratios to decline as you build the business?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, let me start with some overall thoughts on Solutions as well and then Chris I will ask you to comment on this one. Obviously, a disappointing quarter. With that said, it's important to remember the transformation that Solutions has undergone over the last couple of years. The last couple of years, we've built a global leader in the mobile and Connected Living business. We've expanded our distribution. We've added clients. We've added services and we're building a much more diversified set of earnings. With that said, it does have some quarter-to-quarter volatility on that journey, but we feel very good about the evolution of Solutions. Chris, do you want to comment more specifically?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, I think in general, so, again work to do on the international side \u2013 targeting the 95% combined ratio has been the long-term goal and we're going to continue to focus on increased operational efficiencies in order to achieve that. I think on the domestic side, as we move more to the fee-based model, the concept of a combined ratio probably is less relevant but I think the focus here is long-term growth in NOI. We expect to see growth 2016 versus 2015, largely backend loaded, if you will, as we ramp up some of the new programs that we've been \u2013 we've had relationships that we've talked about. And then long-term, on average, a 10% annual growth rate of NOI is still an achievable result.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And if we think about \u2013 you've talked about long-term 10% growth \u2013 the fourth quarter of 2015 obviously makes that kind of growth rate for 2016, perhaps a lot easier to achieve. I guess with maybe the exception being if there is some sustainability of a little bit of that weakness in the fourth quarter into the first part of 2016. Is that how we should be thinking about things for 2016? I mean, the outlook commentary still says growth, but it doesn't really change to reflect the fact that fourth quarter was weak. Do you understand what I'm getting at?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. No, John, I understand. We tend to not focus on the quarter-to-quarter, we focus much more on the long-term and where this business is going. If we think about 2016, what we've said is, we expect earnings growth in Solutions in 2016, that's going to be more in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. The first half of the year, we still have the ongoing impact of the tablet program that we've talked about. But by the time we get into the second half of the year, some of the new launches that we've been investing in, expenses to support really become to fruition and we expect improvement in international as well as some other expense initiatives.","I think the important thing about this business is, we're feeling very good about the long-term direction and the growth, if you look at it over the last few years, has been dramatic in Solutions.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah, no question. And then, just a real quick. The $6 million of higher expenses in the fourth quarter in Solutions to start up a couple of new programs, is that a pre or after tax number?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","That number's after-tax.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jimmy.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Good morning, Jimmy.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. So, just on the placement rate in the Specialty Property business, it has been declining, but I think that the decline's been slower than what you would have assumed a few years ago, so what's your expectation for the area when it eventually settles and your best guess as to when it gets there, because it seems like now, we've seen a consistent decline, whereas in the past, it had been a little bit more stable? Then I have another one after that.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. I guess in general, I think perhaps it was slower versus several years ago. But really right now, if you look at the year-over-year that's really in line with our expectations. I think the guidance we've given is longer-term, a 1.8% to 2.1% placement rate. What we will do at Investor Day is provide you an update, in terms of our outlook on the path forward.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And as that happens, I'd assume there would be negative expense leverage in the business. What's your ability to cut expenses to offset the impact, or have you cut expenses to the extent you were \u2013 you believe, you'll be able to?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, we are absolutely focused on operational efficiencies. We've talked in the past about Project Encore, which was a multi-year program designed to improve the customer service experience and expenses, primarily through technology enhancements. Last year, the run rate savings exceeded the net investment. We're going to continue to invest this year, and then full run rate savings will be achieved in 2017. So, the expectation is it will exit 2016 and move into 2017 with a much more \u2013 an appropriate infrastructure and expense base relative to it, keep pace with the decline in the revenue and lender-placed.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Jimmy, the other important point there is, it's not linear quarter-to-quarter. What we're really focused on is making sure we have an operating model that can continue to deliver great consumer and client experience but that ultimately delivers that insurance expense ratio in the mid-40s. And as Chris said, we do expect significant savings in 2016, which will help offset some of the normalization of lender-placed.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of the deployment of the money that comes out of the sale of the Employee Benefits business, assuming that the sale closes at the end of the first quarter, do you expect the dividend to show up (27:50) in the second quarter, and you'd use most of that for buying back stock, would it be in the second quarter and third quarters or could it be spread over the next year?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me start on that and then Chris can talk in a little more detail on benefits specifically. I mean our approach to capital management remains the same as it's been now for many years, which is we're committed to this disciplined return of capital to shareholders through the dividend and the buyback as well as appropriate investments in our ongoing businesses either through organic or through M&A. With that said, Chris, do you want to comment more specifically on (28:25) and the timing.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Sure. So maybe to talk in general about all of the anticipated proceeds this year, both benefits and health, I think so we anticipate the close in the first quarter of the benefits business, those proceeds will arrive at a legal entity, we will request a dividend in the second quarter. And then, some additional ongoing release of capital throughout the balance of the year. On the health side, the focus right now is to honor our obligations to the insurance pay claims, which on the 2015 policies, which will tail off as we move through 2016. We expect receipt of the risk adjuster and reinsurance recovery receivables in the second half and expect to have the lion's share of the $475 million of dividends occur then. So sort of a second quarter and then second half significant amount of proceeds available for deployment.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just on the usage of those proceeds, I think you've mentioned M&A and buybacks, is that still the case? And on M&A, what's the pipeline like \u2013 obviously in the past, you haven't done deals that have been as large as what's the amount that can be freed up's going to be?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. There's no change in our approach to capital management. We look at deploying it through returning it to shareholders as well as investing in the future. We have an ongoing pipeline of M&A really in and around the businesses that we play in, and you've seen the kind of deals that we've announced that are really in the mobile business, in the multifamily housing, and the mortgage solutions. They're really trying to deepen and invest in our core growth areas. We have a decent pipeline of those, but equally we are committed to return of capital.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Mark.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. You've been nice and clear about the insurance expense ratio and Specialty Property going back to the mid-40s, similar numerical target for the Solutions business. I hear what you're saying that the growth in the fee makes that a little less useful, but it was elevated this quarter. How much lower should it get back to?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, I think our focus really when it comes to Solutions is the long-term NOI targets that we talked about, again growth in 2016 versus 2015, 10% average annual growth over the long-term in that business. In terms of Q4, we had some ramp-up costs in anticipation of future program launches and servicing existing program launches. There were some additional costs associated with sourcing and servicing some of the programs that we had in place. I think between the focus on operational efficiencies within Solutions and then some of the transformational work that we've got underway at the enterprise, we expect to create some greater operational efficiencies going forward to help us achieve that 10% NOI growth target.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then relative to the first half, you talk about growth focused on the second half, but you got some tough comps in the Solutions business. Are you going to be flat in the first half year-over-year, which would be a lot better than you did in Q4, or should we look for down in the first half?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, I don't think we want to talk about quarter-over-quarter or half-over-half, just as a reminder in the first half, we're going to have again the ongoing impact of the tablet program which we've talked about. There'll be some additional pressures around some of the traditional North American retail business, and the run-off credit business. And then in the second half as some of these programs we've described on the mobile side, start to ramp up and generate increased revenue, that's what we're going to see most of the majority of the NOI growth for the full year.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","On the Health business, I think you've touched on any of these points. But just so I've got it straight in my own mind, the incremental expense that you're looking at now relative to what you've discussed three months ago. Could you just run through those in the Health segment?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, a couple things and I'll talk a little bit about the concept of the PDR, and what's in the GAAP PDR versus the stat PDR. The GAAP PDR you can put direct expenses which we have in there. On the stat side, it's a bit more onerous, so we've already prefunded some future severance and some indirect expenses.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'm thinking about not the timing of payout, which you've already described. But any kind of new or incremental or additional payments or expenses that have developed over the last three months?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","No, I think we're on track. I think claims experience has been in line with our estimate, the expenses are also in line. I think right now, when I think about the $475 million of dividends. We've got some risk in our estimation around the reinsurance recoverable, and the risk adjuster. We do have some risk potentially in terms of how the 2015 claims emerge over \u2013 the majority of which will be over the first half of 2016. But again, better line of sight in every month that goes by where claims are in line with our expectations gives us a greater degree of comfort that we'll exit that business with some significant capital return to the holding company.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah and we mentioned this in the prepared remarks as well but the January claims experience on the 2015 policies, developed as we expected as well. So I think the good news is the last three months or four months, things in health have been performing as we have now expected.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","How much of the \u2013 in property, I think you had given the 570 basis points of impact from lower premiums, higher legal, how much of that was legal and is that going to drop off pretty quickly?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, I think on the legal side, at this point, there are ongoing matters as we mentioned. We can't quantify that, but based on what we know today, we feel appropriately reserved for the legal cost.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey. Good morning, Sean.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Sean.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Good morning. In property, so the loss ratio will trend to the mid-40s, is it safe to assume that your expectations for the normalized loss ratio \u2013 for the base loss ratio ex-cats will be higher than it was in 2015?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So in terms of \u2013 well again, keep in mind, the rate \u2013 there's the absolute expenses versus the ratio. I think, in 2016, I don't want to predict, but the expense saves that are coming from some of the operational efficiency programs that are under way will achieve kind of full run-rate status by the end of 2016 into 2017, that will allow us to get to that longer term 45% insurance expense ratio.","In terms of loss ratios, we're seeing better non-cat loss experience, which is \u2013 some of it is mild weather related, but some of it is actually related to fire and theft trending lower. So we feel a little bit better about that, but again, keep in mind the ratio is going to be a function of not just the numerator where it should be (36:12) absolute losses, but the decline in the denominator which is the normalization of lender-placed and the lower premiums going forward.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And if we do slip into a recession in 2016, there's the possibility that the placement rate will stop contracting, correct?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I wouldn't want to speculate on that, but certainly we've seen in past housing cycles that if the housing market goes into a downturn, our business has benefited.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. And just a question about the tax rate in Solutions, where should we be modeling that?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","I think, longer term, we're looking at roughly in the low-30s would be a good number.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And that's because of the international mix of business?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","That's correct. Yes.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. All right.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","The mix of business internationally, yes.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, Michael. Good morning.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So thinking about the strong fee based sources of income that have been growing in Specialty Property, can you give us a sense of what you're seeing as the organic growth rate in those businesses maybe more specifically by some of the lines that you're targeting growth in, and fair to assume that we're close to really organic growth rates in the fourth quarter or anything we should be backing up?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, first thing I would say, we're going to, at our Investor Day, provide more disclosure around the growth areas. So that would be multifamily housing, that would be the mortgage solutions business. In the multifamily housing business, there is market growth as people rent more, we're gaining share as well and I think we've said roughly a 20% growth in that business over time. And then, in mortgage solutions, when we purchased a couple of companies that we acquired back in 2013, 2014, they had about $250 million all-in of revenue, that's now up to $290 million in 2015, and so we had pretty good growth through share gain there as well.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. That's helpful. And then, in terms of thinking about Solutions, I guess you'd outline some ongoing costs relative to sort of servicing ongoing programs I should say. Can you help us understand what those costs are related to, first? And then second, as it relates to Solutions expenses, when we think about program launches, is it reasonable to expect that 6 months to 12 months before the program sort of fully up or can you help us get a sense of where the incremental costs versus revenues come in when we hear those announcements?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, to answer the first half, I think the primary source of the increased expense was really sourcing phones and parts as opposed to the labor associated with the servicing. In terms of the second question, each program is different. They all start small, we \u2013 in the fourth quarter, we talked about preparing for anticipated program launches and existing programs that are going to grow, now that's largely staffing. So that's people, and I think \u2013 but I wouldn't want to put a target number on a program, because they each emerge differently.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And then, one last one, the lender-placed. Any sense of what renewal premiums or rates you're getting in core states like Florida, California, and New York? And then, also sort of more broadly, are you seeing any change in competition following in the completion of the QBE National General deal in the fourth quarter?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So right now, we're in what I would call a normal course filing process. We have ongoing dialogue with all of our regulators, those filings have varying degrees of frequency. We do have some \u2013 we've modeled in, in terms of some of the anticipated revenue declines, some additional rate, which we anticipate. On the other hand, we know that we're providing a valuable product and service in terms of capacity in some of the cat-prone markets. In terms of competition, we wouldn't want to talk about anything in particular, we do feel very good about \u2013 it's a competitive market, but we feel very good about our product offering, and continue to believe that our services are appropriate, and it's why we're a market leader.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz from Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Steven.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Hey, good morning to you guys. First, a couple on Solutions. First on the expense side, I'm wondering here if we can look at this somewhat as you look at Specialty Property in terms of providing an expense ratio, either on insurance or the fee side. Your revenues are flat year-over-year, the expenses were up after the two items that you talked about, the launch costs and the prior period adjustment, by about $33 million despite revenues being flat, but, the fee income is up dramatically. So, what I'm assuming here, and Chris, you can tell me if I'm right, is that what we're really looking at here is mix shift on the expense line?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Let me comment on that. Yeah. One of the challenges when you look at Solutions is you have very different businesses, and there is a major mix shift going on there. What we wanted to with the Investor Day is help all of our investors better understand the lines of business that we have. And so, just a couple things we plan to cover at the March 8, Investor Day, we'll talk about kind of long-term targets, and update those for both the company and then some of the key lines of businesses. We'll provide more disclosure around the key growth areas of the company, and what's really growing for the company are the fee income and capital light businesses like mobile, mortgage solutions, multifamily housing. And then, we'll talk about capital management and how that plays into achieving our long-term targets for the company. So, it's hard to give a meaningful overall number for Solutions. We'll provide more granularity at Investor Day.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I'm sure that will all be good. And then, also on Solutions, maybe you can just remind us about the seasonality of the fee income. Obviously, you get a big boost in the fourth quarter, you did last year as well \u2013 is that marketing dollars for Christmas?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's more tied to individual carriers and partners, and what they're doing. It's not really seasonal in that way. So, it's hard to generalize that.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, Chris, on the corporate and other, you gave guidance. Could you maybe quantify for us what you think the orphan costs will be from the exit from employee benefits and health that will be included in corporate now?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, maybe just a couple of examples. I'm not sure we can give you specific numbers, but they are reflected, first of all, they're reflected in our target run rate of $70 million, but \u2013 so, when benefits is sold and health is wound down, we're still going to have financial reporting costs. We're still going to have asset management costs associated with the other $12 billion of assets that we manage. We're going to absorb those. We did take the decision to freeze the pension plan, was designed to help offset some of those stranded costs, and then, of course, all the transformation work that's under way is also designed to not just absorb stranded overhead that we're going to see coming out of health and benefits, but also to better position the company going forward, to be more agile, but then also more efficient in terms of support functions.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Does the pension plan savings, does that run through corporate or does that run through the segments?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, it's based on pensionable wages, it's roughly half corporate and then, the rest is distributed across Solutions and Specialty Property.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hall from Wells Fargo. Please go head.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, John.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hi, John.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. I have a question around capital management. I guess when you sort of accelerated repurchases and the like your leverage was fairly low, it's moving up a little bit. As you go forward, should we be considering and thinking about I guess debt retirement along the way as you balance the capital management program?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, the capital management decisions and the ongoing capital structure is all part of the decision making. As we deploy the capital either through in share repurchase, dividends or organic and growth through M&A, we'll keep an eye on the debt-to-capital ratio. As a reminder, we went public with a 25% debt-to-cap and been able to stay below that going forward. Any decision that we might make around changing the capital structure would probably be one that we would do in concert with the maturing 2018, $350 million five-year note that matures. But again, this \u2013 and then, there are scenarios depending on how earnings volatility emerges and we move more towards the fee-based structure. We may decide that there's a possibility of potentially increasing leverage, but not a focus right now. We've got plenty of deployable capital, no need to go out and borrow more.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood. And as far as the mortgage solutions business goes, you've done a good job of penetrating across the servicers and the originators so far. I guess what's holding you back on the other five and the other three in the top 10?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we obviously, I won't comment on specific clients, but broadly, these are long sales cycles. You normally get in \u2013 get a trial. You need to prove you can deliver and over time, will grow and that's been what's happening. But we're in active discussions with many target clients that we'd like to have in our portfolio.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, John.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to think about the impact in Specialty Property, lender-placed declining, premiums declining, catastrophe reinsurance program, costs are across the line (47:07) lower, geography is roughly similar. I just wanted to think about what kind of catastrophe loss ratio you guys would consider roughly normal as we think out to 2016. Obviously, 2015 was a light year, so if we just model a normal year we'd expect something higher, I'm just curious how you think about what a normal year would look like in points?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","John, it's very difficult to put a number on, it's variable, I mean, the only thing I will say is that we haven't had a major catastrophe hit Florida in particular and we've been \u2013 the light cat years are not going to continue, I mean, the odds don't favor that. So it's something to keep in mind. We do spend a lot of money on catastrophe reinsurance for that very reason. The fact that we've not had claims in terms of our reinsurance tower won't change what we're going to do in terms of purchasing protection because we know that preserving the balance sheet and preserving earnings stream is very important to us going forward.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The other important point, John, is as the business normalizes, our exposure risk has been coming down significantly. And as Chris said, we then build an adequate reinsurance tower to help mitigate the risk if a cat does occur.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah. I guess my point is, I assume that the business normalizes, since so much of the growth was coastal. As it normalizes, I would expect that the geography mix would revert back to a more normal level as well and your cat exposure in a more normal cat year ought to decline. Is that a reasonable way to think about it even if we can't talk numbers?","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","I mean, in general, I guess that's okay, but I mean there's lots of factors that go in here. We have seen some shift in terms of the cat exposure, but it's still coastal, out of the Southeast, but into the Northeast. If you think about the most recent significant event that we had, Superstorm Sandy was a Northeast event. Again \u2013 we will make our decisions on reinsurance purchases based upon the information we have in front of us at the time. In terms of rate, rate seems to be bottoming, but as Alan mentioned, our overall exposure is going down, and that's the main driver of lower reinsurance costs.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The other important point I think is, we are with our product, providing a very valuable service to the mortgage industry, and it will have more coastal, it has always had more coastal than a normal book of business.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Understood. And then, last question, maybe it's for you, Alan. I want to think about the $74 million of buyback in fourth quarter. When you reported your third quarter earnings, I think you had mentioned in the release that you had done $74 million of buybacks in most of the month of October. So November and December obviously, you weren't in the market. You've got a significant amount of inflows to the parent coming. Is it simply a matter of timing of those cash flows to the parent that kept you out of the market in November and December or was there something else?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Many, many factors go into our thinking about repurchasing our stock. First, is our stock attractive? And we believe it is attractive, and remains attractive. In the fourth quarter, there was a lot of uncertainty around health, and we felt prudent was to hold our capital just in case. We're now feeling much better about how health has developed. And I think what you've seen us doing, and you saw us to do it in January, we were obviously actively back in the market again. And over time, we are committed to that return of capital to shareholders as well as appropriate investments in our core businesses.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, John, this is Chris, and I mean the other thing I would point out is and again we talked about this in the past. We feel very comfortable with our approach to share repurchase. Again, 10b5-1 programs in the market consistently prospective based upon our views around capital inflows and outflows. Alan's point around the conservatism or the prudent approach given the uncertainty around health is I think consistent with how we've done things in the past. And then as you go back and you look, we've bought 56 million shares since 2010 through February 5. So it's unambiguous that we're willing to return the capital and we do think share repurchase has been and will continue to be a prudent use of deployable capital.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Understood. Thank you for that.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. I think you've touched on this but the general point of with growth in fee income, does that tend to be more expense heavy upfront as a general matter and then you would assume that it will get more profitable over time?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I wouldn't think of it exactly that way. It does tend to be expense heavy that's the nature of that business. That's one of the reasons why you see the noise in those various ratios is that as we grow the fee income businesses, they have a higher component of fee expense relative to the income they generated, but I wouldn't assume that they start high expenses always and get better over time.","Christopher J. Pagano - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, I think the other thing to remember and I think this is one of the key components of our RF thesis (52:49) around mortgage solutions was fixed cost but gross (52:57) scale and through that achieve operational efficiencies, so there is a fixed variable element, which as we grow these businesses will create a better expense ratio going forward.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","You say you've got seven servicers of the top 10 servicers you have relationships with, what's your penetration among those seven? How much of their business do you have?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's fair to say in general, we have a small, but growing piece of their business with a lot of opportunity to consolidate a very fragmented set of relationships and markets.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, the final question on M&A. Are you finding the competition or valuations a little more attractive these days or is it about the same?","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's hard to generalize. what I would say is, we've been very consistent on our M&A approach, which is defined kind of smaller deals that naturally fit into what we're doing, and that's where we remain focused in our M&A.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Alan B. Colberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Well, thank you everyone for participating in today's call. We look forward to hosting our Investor Day on March 8, when our executive team will provide an update on our long-term strategy to reposition the company for profitable growth. As always, you can reach out to Suzanne Shepherd and Jisoo Suh with any follow-up questions. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Analysts","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (NYSE:USA) LLC","Operator","Welcome to Assurant's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Francesca Luthi, Chief Communication Officer and Marketing Officer. You may begin.","Francesca Luthi - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2017 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2017 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. As a reminder, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our reportable segments to align with the company's new global operating model. As a result, our reportable segments now comprise, Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed, and Corporate.","Net operating income includes contributions from these four reportable segments, as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Health runoff operations, the divested Employee Benefits, and amortization of deferred gains from dispositions, and other items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the company. Related prior-period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation.","On today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.","We'll begin the call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release, as well as in our SEC reports, including our Form 10-K.","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we delivered solid results in the first quarter of this year. Global Lifestyle reported strong earnings, better than we had expected. While segment results were helped by some one-time items in the quarter, we were pleased with our underlying performance.","Overall for Assurant this year, we continue to believe that our total operating earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, will be generally level with 2016, and that operating earnings per share will increase double digits. As we move through 2017, we expect to see continued growth across our targeted areas, as well as in vehicle protection. Our success has been largely driven by our ability to adapt to evolving client and consumer expectations. Extending our competitive advantage, we'll require ongoing investments in our technology infrastructure and other capabilities.","Across Assurant, expense management efforts are ongoing, and remain central to our culture of continuous improvement. We've identified savings to fund our technology enhancements and moderate the impact from expected declines in lender-placed and legacy businesses. Overall, though results may vary by quarter, we are confident that growth in our targeted areas, together with expense efficiencies, will enable us to deliver on our commitments for 2017. And importantly, we believe our transformation is solidifying a foundation for profitable growth and ongoing cash flow in 2018 and beyond.","Let me now offer a few updates from the first quarter. In Global Housing, we completed the first client beta implementation of our new lender-placed platform. This represents a milestone for the business. Work began several years ago in partnership with our clients, when we saw the opportunity to create greater standardization, while providing an even better customer experience. During the course of this year and next, we will be transferring other clients onto this new platform, enabling us to deliver efficiencies long term as we work to mitigate the impact of lender-placed normalization.","Mortgage solutions posted weaker results for the quarter, driven by softer than excepted demand. We took action in the quarter to reduce variable expenses, and are implementing a number of technology enhancements to strengthen the business and support growth long term. In multi-family housing, year-over-year, we increased our policies in force by more than 200,000 to nearly 1.6 million.","Turning to Global Lifestyle, first quarter results came in better than anticipated. Overall, we were pleased with the segment's underlying performance, which benefited from higher contributions from service contracts in vehicle protection and Connected Living.","Despite less favorable experience in Europe, our mobile business performed largely as expected. To sustain momentum, we'll continue to focus our efforts on innovation to anticipate both client and consumer needs. As an example, we worked with T-Mobile to launch a new premium device protection plan that now includes AppleCare services. We believe this unique offering makes for a better consumer experience, by providing 24\/7 priority access to AppleCare services technical support, as well as device repair or replacement through Apple.","We're proud of our ability to act as a catalyst, bringing together leading companies in the mobile arena to deliver new and compelling offerings. And as our mobile business continues to ramp up, the wind-down of Assurant Health is now essentially complete. In the first quarter, the runoff of claims was faster than expected, and we collected all outstanding net recoverables related to the 2015 ACA risk mitigation programs. I want to thank the employees and leadership at Health for their tremendous efforts over the last couple of years to ensure a successful wind-down.","Let me now provide an update on our progress, as measured by our three key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share, and operating return on equity. All metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather.","For the first quarter, net operating income decreased $3 million year-over-year to $106 million, reflecting declines in lender-placed, partially offset by better profitability in extended service contracts, and certain one-time items in Global Lifestyle. Operating earnings per diluted share increased 13% to $1.88 for the quarter driven by share repurchase activity. And finally, annualized operating ROE excluding AOCI was 10.8%, up from 10.5% at year-end. Continuing to grow fee-based capital-light offerings will be an important driver of ROE expansion by 2020.","Our balance sheet also remains strong. At the end of March, we had $605 million of holding company capital after returning $135 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Our capital position allows us to continue investing in our businesses, organically and through select acquisitions. We're also meeting our commitment to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of this year.","Overall, we're encouraged by the progress we're making in our transformation, as we build an even stronger Assurant for the future.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review segment results for the quarter in greater detail. Richard?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing, which produced earnings of $62 million, down $14 million from the same period last year. The change was primarily driven by declines in lender-placed as well as softer results within mortgage solutions. A combined ratio for Global Housing risk-based businesses increased 220 basis points to 82.9%. Lower placement rates in the lender-placed business as well as higher expenses to onboard new client loans drove the increase.","The first quarter of 2017 benefited from more favorable loss experience. Reportable catastrophes losses totaled $900,000 pre-tax, net of $5.2 million of favorable reserve development related to Hurricane Matthew. The pre-tax margin for our fee-based capital-light businesses decreased 220 basis points to 8.8%. Weaker performance in mortgage solutions coming from softer market conditions, originations and field services, coupled with lower client volumes, contributed to the decline.","As Alan discussed earlier, we are right-sizing expenses in mortgage solutions, while at the same time implementing technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies long term. Meanwhile, our multi-family housing business continue to grow profitably, largely through expansion within our affinity channels, as well as more favorable loss experience.","Turning to revenue. First quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 8%, primarily due to lower placement and lower premium rates in our lender-placed insurance business. Our placement rate was 1.96% at the end of the first quarter, down from 2% at year-end. This 4 basis point reduction is consistent with trends seen in prior years.","Now, let's move to revenue for our fee-based capital-light businesses. Multi-family housing increased 11% during the quarter. This reflects double-digit growth in renters' policies sold to our affinity channels and property management network. In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 20%, primarily related to declining volumes in originations and field services discussed earlier.","For 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing net earned premiums and earnings excluding catastrophe losses. The key variables will be the pace of lender-placed normalization and our progress in driving operating efficiencies near-term. We expect continued profitable growth in our fee-based capital-light businesses overall, with a focus on improving underlying earnings in mortgage solutions.","Now, let's move to Global Lifestyle. This segment's earnings increased by $11 million to $52 million, ahead of our expectations for the quarter. This was largely attributable to $7.5 million after-tax of one-time client recoverables within Connected Living and credit, and is representative of our ongoing efforts to improve client mix and profitability internationally. Underlying results were solid across most lines of business. We recorded higher profitability and extended service contracts resulting from favorable experience, expense savings, and a broader shift to OEMs and online channels. Vehicle protection also grew due to prior period sales.","Overall earnings growth within Global Lifestyle was partially offset by higher mobile playing costs in Europe, which now have largely been remunerated. Revenue for the segment decreased by 14% entirely due to a $137 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the change in a client program structure implemented late last year. As a reminder, this change also extended our relationship with an important Connected Living client, and have no impact on earnings. Excluding this change and the client recoverables, revenues for Global Lifestyle were essentially flat as ongoing declines in legacy businesses were offset by higher volumes at vehicle service contracts and growth in our Canadian credit business.","Within mobile, growth in covered devices was offset by lower fee income from mobile repair and logistics services. First quarter of 2016 benefited from stronger repair and logistics volumes, driven by the timing of new product launches into the market.","Turing to key performance metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which include vehicle protection and credit insurance, improved by approximately 240 basis points to 92.2%, driven largely by client recoverables. In addition, we saw favorable loss experience in credit. Going forward, we expect the combined ratio to trend within the long-term range of 96% to 98%. The pre-tax margin for the fee-based business or Connected Living rose to 7.1% from 4.5% last year. Approximately 230 basis points of the increase was driven by client recoverables, and change in the client program structure referenced earlier.","The balance reflected better underlying results in extended service contracts, partially offset by mobile. For the full year 2017, we have not changed our expectations for Global Lifestyle overall. We expect segment net operating income to increase from Connected Living, driven primarily by mobile, as we implement new offerings and expand share with existing clients. Higher profitability from the vehicle protection business is also expected to be a driver, along with expense management efforts already underway across Global Lifestyle. All of this is expected to help mitigate declines in legacy businesses.","While earnings may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on volumes, loss experience and other factors, we are confident that the segment will continue to deliver long-term earnings growth of 10% or more on an average annual basis.","Now, let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased $4 million to $10 million. But as a reminder, first quarter 2016 results were negatively impacted by $3.9 million coming from an adjustment to reserves and deferred acquisition costs related to an older block of policies. Excluding this adjustment, underlying earnings increased slightly with additional investment income offsetting higher mortality rates.","Total revenue for the quarter was up about 3%, while new sales increased by 2% year-over-year. In 2017, we continue to expect fee income and earnings to grow in Preneed, driven by increased production across North America and operational efficiencies.","Moving to Corporate. The first quarter net operating loss decreased by $4 million to $10 million. This was due in part to reductions in estimated employee related costs, and additional investment income generated from assets transferred to Corporate after the sale of Employee Benefits. While still early, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million, as we redeploy most savings this year to support our multi-year transformation. These investments include the implementation of a centralized procurement function, along with investments in technology and other key capabilities. Throughout the year, we will update you on our progress, as we are committed to reducing corporate expenses over time.","Moving on to capital. We ended the quarter with approximately $355 million in deployable capital. We upstreamed $43 million of capital to the holding company during the quarter. This included $28 million in dividends from our operating segments, and $15 million in capital from Health.","For the full year, we continue to expect operating segment dividends to approximate segment earnings, and in addition to receive approximately $100 million in total from Health and Employee Benefits, as we release residual capital.","During the first quarter, we returned $135 million to shareholders with $105 million returned via share buybacks, and the remaining $30 million through common stock dividends. Also throughout April, we repurchased another $38 million of stock, bringing the total amount returned to shareholders since January 2016 to nearly $1.2 billion.","To summarize, we've continued to make good progress in the first quarter, and have delivered solid results. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders for the full year, and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. My question is one the mobile business. And if we look at the disclosure around mobile covered devices, it appears flat to year-end. The premium line moves around a little bit because of that program restructure, so I was just curious, if you could guide us about the best way to think about how top line progression in the mobile business, and how we can measure that?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. Certainly, Seth. I mean, first of all, in mobile, I think we felt good about the first quarter. It was in line with what we had expected. As we look through the second quarter and beyond, really three things are going on that will continue to drive performance in that business. One is, we are expanding with our existing clients. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned the rollout with T-Mobile of AppleCare. We're also in the process of launching premium technical support, which is another fee income service with some of our clients.","Also, later in the year, we expect significant increase in trading activity, both with carrier promotions, but importantly, the new products that are expected or is excepted at later of the year. And then, finally, we continue to onboard new clients, some of which will impact 2017, the majority of which are going to impact 2018. We actually have a backlog as we implement. And then, finally, the mix is shifting. If you think back a few years, traditionally, that business was a premium business, handset protection, now it's heavily also a fee income business. That just shows up differently in the geography of the P&L. We feel good about the progress of mobile.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So, the \u2013 we're not going to see a lot of that progression, I guess, within the P&L and the disclosure, if I'm understanding correctly, since only a piece of that comes from on-boarding new clients. Is that the right way to think about it?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","What you'll see, we're disclosing a few of the key metrics now between the number of subscribers which is more of the premium-based fees with the business, and then the number of devices that we have processed through our facilities, but the important thing to focus on is profit.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then, I'm not sure if you could comment about share buyback, just considering the amount of excess capital that you have in cash on hand. The first quarter, I guess, was just a little bit late from what I expected. I would have expected a little bit more rapid deployment. So if you could just help us think through sort of the pace of bringing that excess capital back.","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Sure. And good morning, Seth. It's Richard. Yeah. Just to maybe back up one step, at the beginning of 2016, we committed to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of this year. As we get through at the end of April, we find ourselves at about having returned $1.2 billion both from share buybacks and dividends. So we're, I would say, sort of well ahead of the pace that we've put for ourselves. And really to answer your question more specifically, in terms of the first quarter, typically in a first quarter, we would be a little bit lighter in things as we see the year evolve and understand how we get through the summer and cat experience and all of that. But we are on track for the $1.5 billion and ahead of the pace.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Jimmy.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Good morning.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. So, first question on just the mortgage solutions business. The results this quarter were weak. Do you view that as an anomaly or have your expectations for growth in that business changed at all?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, let me back up a little context on that business, and how we think about it. So we entered these businesses starting about three to four years ago now, really to leverage our strong client partnerships in the housing space. And our thesis was that we could gain share leveraging our partnerships and that worked very well in 2015 and into 2016. Really a couple of things happened late last year, early into this year, none of which changed our long-term perspective on the business. One is market demand has gotten softer than anybody had forecasted, really driven by the uncertainty in the economy and uncertainty on interest rate direction. And then, as we have been implementing our technology upgrades to really bring these businesses together, we've had some short-term client allocation shifts, but they don't fundamentally change how we think about this. So, weaker in the quarter. We are not happy with that, but we took aggressive action as to the leadership of that business. And we still feel very good about the longer term for mortgage solutions.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the vehicle service business also, you've seen very strong, generally double-digit growth in that business. This quarter was a little bit of a slowdown. Any color on what happened there?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah, no, I think from quarter-to-quarter, there could be small movements, but we did have some, as you mentioned, some very strong top line growth. We're attracting new clients, and the outlook is still intact for VPS to do well for the full year.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just lastly, on the share buybacks, I think you have about $540 million remaining in your authorization as of the end of May. Do you expect to complete that this year, by the end of the year? Because that would put you above your initial targets that you had mentioned for capital deployment?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","So, Jimmy, let's make sure everyone is clear on what we committed to in capital deployment, which was to return $1.5 billion through both dividends and buybacks. So we have more than enough authorization in place to deliver on our commitment of $1.5 billion.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No. That's what I meant. I just was trying to get a sense of if you intend to complete the authorization this year.","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Not going to comment on that. What we do intend to commit is that we will hit that $1.5 billion that we've committed to return to shareholders. With authorizations, as appropriate, we'll go back to the board for additional authorizations. But bottom line, we feel very good about the capital position. We're going to continue to pursue both growth, funding organic growth and selective M&A, while continuing our long track record of returning capital to shareholders.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, John.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Good morning, Alan. Good morning, Richard. Just following up on mortgage solutions first, the revenues there were down 20% year-over-year, but I think if I recall correctly, you actually had an acquisition that should be contributing to that piece of the business, the American Title deal. So, is my recollection right and did that contribute this quarter? And if it did, what was the contribution and how do we think about the revenues on sort of an organic basis there? Because it looks like it slowed down even worse than the 20.","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, John. It's Richard. I'll take that one. Yeah, you're referring to the acquisition of American Title, and you're right. It added about $10 million to the revenue line. So you could back that out. It would bring down the overall revenues by 30%, 33% overall.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And so, Alan, whether it's 20% or 33%, either one sounds very significant. I get that you're saying that nothing that's happened here has really changed your long-term outlook. I guess, how do you have that confidence?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, a couple of things. First, we're still bigger than we were when we acquired these companies, even with the disruption that's going on in the market in the short term. And it really was largely driven in originations, which has been affected by the uncertainty in the economy.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","I think the originations were down in that 33%, 34% type range sequentially, but this business is still small, not material to our overall results, and bigger and the thesis has worked out until the last couple of quarters, and we don't see anything that would change that. And then, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are able to quickly adjust the cost structure in this business. So that any problems can be remediated within a quarter or two.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I mean, that's helpful. So, we should be thinking about originations as really important driver, a data point for this piece of the business. And...","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","Certainly important, yes.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. And then, overall, if I think about the longer term target, right, fee-based capital-light within Global Housing, I think you've indicated at your Investor Day a year-and-a-half ago or so that that's expected to be about 35% to 40% of the segment's earnings by 2020. This quarter and I guess recently, it looks like it's sort of a mid-teens contribution. How much in M&A, when you think about the next couple of years and the driver of the growth in the earnings contribution from this piece, how much in M&A is required to get there versus organic growth?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","We don't assume any M&A is required. We believe we'll achieve it through organic growth in both the multi-family housing and the mortgage solutions businesses.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, last one also focusing here in Global Housing, if I do some math on the lender-placed business, it appears, and I know this is imperfect, but it appears that the premium rate on the lender-placed is down year-over-year about 5% to 6%. Is that about right based on what you guys are seeing in the business? And also as we think about looking forward, how much more pressure should we expect to see on premium rates, before you expect that to stabilize, when you think about that normalization of the business?","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","So, a couple of thoughts there, John. I think the primary driver of our results recently has been the placement rate, and that came down 4 basis points, as the housing market continues to recover quarter-on-quarter. What we said on rates I think is still very much true, which is we're now normal course. We settled multi-state, and that's behind us. We have some states that approve increases based on our experiences, some states that have reductions based on experience. But I wouldn't anticipate any extraordinary trend there.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Is the mid-single digit decline at least on a year-over-year basis, is that about right?","Richard S. Dziadzio - Assurant, Inc.","There is a number of things going on in the lender-placed revenues, as Alan said. It's placement rates, which would be the main driver. So it's placement rates, and then obviously, we have some new clients coming in and so forth. So there is offsetting things and there. So I wouldn't put my finger on one number.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I'll follow up offline. Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I will turn the call back to the presenters.","Alan B. Colberg - Assurant, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call. We look forward to updating you on our progress later this year. Please reach out to Francesca Luthi and Sean Moshier with any follow-up questions. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"2956":["Assurant, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Suzanne Shepherd","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2018. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard, before moving into a Q&A session. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings news release as well as in our SEC reports.","During the first quarter, we completed the financing related to our acquisition of The Warranty Group or TWG. This included a $1.3 billion debt issuance, of which $350 million replaced debt that matured during the quarter, and a $288 million mandatory convertible preferred stock issuance. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As such, our first quarter 2018 results and full year 2018 outlook do not include any contributions from The Warranty Group nor the impact of the $1.2 billion of acquisition-related financing.","Prior to closing, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share will exclude the interest expense and dilutive impact of the mandatory convertible preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition financing. These amounts, however, will be reflected in our GAAP results. Once the transaction closes, we will include the related interest expense and dilutive impact of the shares in operating results using the if-converted accounting methodology.","During today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.","I will now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. Results were in line with our expectations. A lower effective tax rate, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, was the primary driver of the earnings increase as well as modest underlying business growth. This growth was partially offset by increased corporate expenses and higher catastrophe losses.","We also continue to make good progress preparing for the closing of The Warranty Group acquisition. This included submitting the required filings and raising the necessary funds to support the acquisition. Integration planning efforts continue and position us well post-closing. Our teams have developed detailed road maps to successfully bring together our business operations within Global Lifestyle, leveraging our combined talent and product offerings worldwide. So far, we have received several regulatory approvals and still expect to close the transaction in the second quarter, subject to the remaining regulatory and customary closing approvals. Overall, we remain bullish on the growth opportunities ahead with The Warranty Group and also, more broadly, across our key lifestyle and housing businesses.","Let me now share some highlights from the quarter. Starting with Global Housing, our focus remains on sustaining our leadership position within lender-placed insurance. This quarter, we migrated our first significant client to our single processing platform. As this work continues, we expect to drive net savings later this year, with more expected in 2019 and beyond. This will help us maintain strong returns within lender-placed and deliver an even better customer experience.","With over 1.8 million insured renters, our multi-family housing business continues to generate strong revenue and earnings growth. This quarter, we extended our resident bond offering to include commercial property owners, management companies and their tenants. Now both residential and commercial property managers can offer a surety bond payment as an alternative to a security deposit. This increases protection, while also reducing the tenant's upfront move-in cost. As we look to further expand our presence in the rental economy, we recently launched a partnership with ApartmentJet to provide multi-family housing owners an insurance solution that covers both nightly and extended-stay guests.","While we were pleased with the performance and growth momentum within multi-family housing, mortgage solutions results remained disappointing. Ongoing weak client demand and soft market conditions, especially in new loan originations and field services, continue to pressure results in the first quarter. We expect this environment will remain challenging for the rest of the year. While mortgage solution is not a significant portion of the segment's results, we are continuing to aggressively take actions to improve performance. This includes continuing to manage expenses, while actively pursuing new business opportunities.","Turning to Global Lifestyle; we continue to expand our mobile business, now protecting 38 million devices worldwide. The significant portion of that increase is coming from our continued success with KDDI, the second-largest carrier in Japan. Since year-end, enrollments in that program nearly doubled. We expect to continue to strengthen our mobile business in the region building on our recent accomplishments in Japan, South Korea and Australia, and also leveraging The Warranty Group's existing footprint in Asia. While first quarter results in the vehicle business were lower, we saw sustained double-digit revenue growth from strong prior period sales from third-party administrators, recreational vehicle distributors and our partnerships with leading OEMs. We now protect 15 million vehicles. Along with The Warranty Group, we believe we can further extend our leadership position and capitalize on emerging growth trends overtime.","We also continue to make select investments in the Connected Living market. During the quarter, this included strengthening our connected home capabilities through an investment in a company which specializes in home installation and technical support services. We also made a modest investment in an Asia Pacific trade-in and device disposition provider as we reinforced our presence in that region. Overall, we believe our efforts to maintain growth momentum and to drive margin improvement across our portfolio positions us well to deliver profitable growth in 2018.","Turning to our financial results; we currently measure our success against three key metrics: net operating income, net operating income per diluted share and operating return on equity, all excluding catastrophe losses. These metrics exclude the impact of our pending acquisition of TWG and our recently completed acquisition financing.","For the first quarter, Assurant's net operating income increased by 8% to $115 million compared to the first quarter of last year. This was driven by a lower effective tax rate and modest underlying growth in the business, offset mainly by higher corporate expenses. Operating earnings per diluted share was $2.14, up 14% year-over-year, reflecting both growth in earnings and 2017 share repurchases. Annualized operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11.2%, up 40 basis points since year-end. For full year 2018, we continue to expect Assurant's standalone net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase 10% to 14% from 2017 reported results of $413 million. This reflects a lower effective tax rate and modest underlying segment earnings growth.","Expansion within our Connected Living, multi-family housing and vehicle protection businesses are expected to offset ongoing declines in lender-placed and credit insurance. As we previously communicated, we'll be redeploying a portion of the tax savings to support growth long term, with investments accelerating later this year. As always, we will continue to focus on actively reducing expenses to expand margins over time. For 2018, we also continue to expect net operating income per diluted share to grow in excess of net operating income, benefiting from 2017 share repurchase activity. This outlook does not include any impact from The Warranty Group acquisition or the related financing. We will update our outlook for the year to include TWG, sometime in the third quarter.","In regard to our longer-term financial metrics and targets, we plan to refresh those to reflect the enhanced financial profile of our combined operations at a later date. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow long term. Our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified earnings. This allows us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long term.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our first quarter 2018 results in greater detail. Richard?","Richard Dziadzio","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $71 million, a $9 million increase from the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate of 21% drove $14 million of additional income. Results also reflected $8 million of higher reportable catastrophes, mainly related to the severe winter storms in the Northeast. Excluding both the reportable catastrophes and the impact of tax reform, underlying earnings increased slightly. Higher contributions from international housing products, growth in multi-family housing and modest income from processing the residual flood claims from Hurricane Harvey were the key drivers. The increase was partially offset by ongoing lender-placed normalization.","Looking at our key metrics, the risk-based combined ratio for our lender-placed and manufactured housing businesses increased to 85.3% from 82.9% in the prior year period. This was mainly due to higher reportable catastrophes noted earlier. Excluding cats, the risk-based combined ratio was roughly flat. The pretax margin for the fee-based, capital-light offerings increased to 11.4% from 8.8% in the first quarter of last year, largely reflecting strong growth in multi-family housing.","Moving to revenue, total Global Housing net earned premium and fee income decreased 2% in the first quarter. Lower placement rates and reductions in real estate owned volumes in lender-placed drove the decline. Fee income was impacted by a decrease in mortgage solutions, as Alan mentioned earlier. The placement rate dropped 22 basis points year-over-year or 4 basis points from the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations. This reduction reflects the overall improvement in the housing market and the higher mix of low placement loans. For the rest of the year, we expect ongoing declines in the placement rate, averaging 4 to 5 basis points per quarter, assuming continued growth in the housing market. The overall revenue decrease was partially offset by continued growth, mainly from affinity partners in multi-family housing.","For 2018, we continue to expect Global Housing's earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, to increase, reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20% to 21%. A portion of tax savings is expected to be reinvested into the segment for future growth later this year. Excluding the tax impact, underlying earnings should be lower as a result of the ongoing normalization of lender-placed and mortgage solution declines. Continued profitable growth in multi-family housing, driven by the expansion of our affinity and property management relationships, as well as increased product penetration, will help to mitigate the decrease.","Moving to Global Lifestyle; this segment reported earnings of $56 million for the first quarter compared to $52 million in the prior period of last year. The first quarter of 2017 included $7.5 million of onetime client recoverables. Excluding this disclosed item and the $7 million benefit from tax reform, net operating income increased $4 million. Underlying results benefited from mobile growth within Connected Living, which was largely attributable to the new mobile programs implemented last year as well as growth from existing clients. We also recorded a benefit related to the revised client contract terms. While this is part of our normal course of business operations, the benefit was higher-than-anticipated and is not expected to recur in the second quarter. Results were partially offset by less favorable vehicle protection results and lower earnings from our U.S. credit business.","Turning to revenue, net earned premiums and fees were up 14% in the quarter. Contributions from new mobile programs, including subscribers and continued growth in vehicle protection, were partially offset by reduced mobile trade-in volumes.","Looking at this segment's profitability metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses increased to 99.1% from 92.2%. This was mainly due to less favorable results in the vehicle protection business, including elevated expenses and higher loss experience compared to a favorable prior period. As a reminder, the prior year period also included $4.3 million pretax benefit from a onetime client recoverable in the credit business. Excluding this benefit, the combined ratio increased 5.6 points due to the factors noted earlier.","The pretax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 8.2% in the first quarter, up from 7.1% in the prior year period. Excluding the $6.7 million of client recoverables from last year, the margin expanded 2.3 points, driven by profitable growth in new and existing programs. Overall, lower margins on trade-in activity partially offset this increase. We are pleased with Lifestyle's first quarter results. For the full year, we still believe net operating income growth will be modest before taking into account tax reform. Mobile will remain a significant contributor, driven by growth from programs implemented in 2017 and continued expansion of our offerings with existing clients. In addition, as we have mentioned before, mobile trade-in activity may fluctuate depending on the success of new phone introductions and mobile carrier promotional activity.","Despite a softer first quarter for the vehicle business, we continue to expect profitable growth for 2018 as strong sales from prior periods continue to earn. Contributions from credit insurance, however, will continue to decline, reflecting run-off business and discontinued partnerships, particularly in the third and fourth quarters. As always, across our business, we will continue to manage expenses. After factoring in the lower effective tax rate, now expected to be roughly 22% to 24%, Global Lifestyle reported earnings should be even higher in 2018. While a portion of tax savings are expected to be reinvested into the business for future growth, we anticipate the investments to occur during the latter part of the year.","Next, let's move to Global Preneed; the segment recorded $10 million in the first quarter net operating income, consistent with the prior year period. Excluding the $2 million benefit from the lower tax rate, earnings were down. This was primarily related to higher IT expenses as we transitioned to a new operating platform. Despite the harsh flu season this year, mortality was only slightly elevated compared to the first quarter of 2017, which was also seasonally high. Revenue in Preneed was up 5%, driven mainly by growth in the U.S, including sales of our Final Preneed product in prior periods. Base sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower Final Need sales as we shift the focus to higher-return multi-pay products.","In 2018, we expect Global Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly, driven by expansion from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. Preneed results will also reflect the lower effective tax rate of approximately 22%, with a portion of savings reinvested into the business later in 2018. At Corporate, the net operating loss was $20 million, a year-over-year increase of $10 million. This was due to higher employee-related expenses compared to a favorable prior period and a $2 million adverse effect from the lower tax rate.","For 2018, we continue to expect the full year corporate net operating loss to be approximately at level with the $63 million loss reported in 2017. After taking into account the lower tax rate of roughly 20% and some level of reinvestments, we expect the net loss to increase to around $80 million.","Turning to capital, excluding the $1.2 billion of financing proceeds related to The Warranty Group acquisition, we ended March with $575 million in total company capital or about $325 million of deployable capital, after adjusting for our risk buffer. Dividends in the quarter from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed totaled $182 million, which included $140 million of capital related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities, following tax reform. This increased our dividend capacity, providing more cash to the holding company and allowed us to lower the amount of equity issued as part of our TWG financing, effectively bringing forward the share repurchases originally planned for later this year. As a result, we did not purchase any shares in the quarter. In terms of uses of cash, we did, however, pay $30 million in shareholder dividends and paid $42 million worth of final claims reserve settlement associated with the 2015 sale of our general agency business. This settlement payment was previously accrued for, and therefore, had no material impact to our income statement.","And finally, we invested $8 million towards strengthening our connected home and asset disposition capabilities, as Alan mentioned earlier. In 2018, we now expect dividends from our operating segments to be greater than segment operating earnings because of the increased dividends made available following the reduction in our deferred tax liability. Dividends from the underlying businesses are expected to approximate segment earnings. Overall, our dividend outlook is subject to customary rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as the growth of the businesses. We believe that this will provide ongoing flexibility to invest in our businesses and support The Warranty Group integration. We continue to believe share buyback activity will be unlikely for the balance of the year, but we will revisit, post close.","As noted earlier, following the closing of The Warranty Group acquisition, we will update our presentation and results and outlook for the full year. Among other things, post-closing, our net operating income will include The Warranty Group results and approximately $36 million after tax of additional annual interest expense related to the acquisition debt financing. This also accounts for the amortization of gains from derivative transactions that were used to hedge interest rate risk.","And for the purposes of net operating income per diluted share, results will reflect the dilutive impact of the mandatory convertible preferred stock on an if-converted accounting basis. Prior to closing, however, the impact of the $1.2 billion acquisition financing will only impact GAAP net income and GAAP diluted net income per share. In the next few weeks, we expect to file a summary of TWG's first quarter results. At this stage in their post process, we believe the business performance continues to track against our expectations and reflects ongoing momentum in their vehicle business.","In summary, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter and remain focused on delivering on our commitments for the full year. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from John Nadel from UBS","John Nadel","So I think one -- the first question I had is just a housekeeping item. So at the end of 1Q, equity ex-AOCI was $4.4 billion. So when you close on The Warranty Group deal and issue the shares to the seller, is it as simple as adding roughly $1 billion to your equity upon the closing, so on a pro forma basis your equity, all else equal, should be around $5.4 billion?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes. John, it's Richard, that's right. We'll issue the equity to 10.4 million shares. Obviously, we'll have [P gap] at the time of closing, so an opening balance sheet, so there might be some adjustments there. But it is like you say.","John Nadel","Okay. So then if we take a step back and think about roughly $5.5 billion of equity, give or take a couple of years out, maybe it's even a growing a bit a few years out, I want to go back to the 15% ROE target in 2020. If I look at this quarter's results ex cat and maybe make a few other adjustments, it looks like you're annualizing to earnings of about $450 million, maybe a little bit higher than $450 million. But if I think about that 15% ROE target it suggests your earnings need to be somewhere between $800 million and $900 million a few years from now. I know TWG is going to add a significant amount to that, but it still feels like there is a pretty big gap to get there. Can you just walk us through maybe a view of the more important drivers of filling that gap over the next few years?","Alan Colberg","Yes. No, certainly, John. And as background for everyone, John's referring to the 15% ROE target we've put out at the January or February 26 Investor -- 2016 Investor Day. Start with our earnings and then add in significant earnings for The Warranty Group, important to remember the synergies that we've talked about, we've said $60 million hard cost synergy run rate. We've said there clearly are going to be some revenue synergy upsides, but we haven't attempted to quantify or value those in our model. And then if you look at our business, we grew earnings in 2017, which is an important step in our transformation. We're going to grow earnings again in our outlook that we provided in 2018. And when you get into 2019 and 2020 with lender-placed normalization nearing its end, we are well positioned to grow earnings rapidly as Assurant.","And then we have opportunities to manage that equity and to go through combined operations and release some capital out of our businesses. With all that said, we are going to, later this year as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, look at the combined company and put out what we think are the right long-term metrics. But for now, we feel like we have momentum toward that ROE target, as I mentioned, we're up 40 basis points versus year-end. And we see good progress in our company.","John Nadel","Okay. So we'll look forward to a more -- I guess, I'll call it a more fulsome update, inclusive of TWG later this year. But that stabilization of LPI and the capital that -- or the cash flow that it will throw off, gives you two key drivers, right? One, it's no more earnings growth pressure as that shrinks; and two, you have the opportunity to be active in capital management.","Alan Colberg","Correct, John. And then the other thing that's important to remember, Lifestyle, we put out back in 2013, a long-term -- we can grow our earnings 10% a year on average, and we have more than delivered on that over the last five years. And we certainly have reaffirmed that we expect, on average, we can grow 10% on average at Lifestyle. So that, combined with a different profile for lender placement as we get into 2019 and beyond, positions us very well for earnings growth.","John Nadel","Okay. That's helpful. And then second question is just thinking about the vehicle protection business. I don't think you're trying to tell us that the margins there, underwriting results there, were weak. I think it was just a year ago that was so good. So the comparison was tough. But can you just confirm that? And obviously, vehicle protection is so important to TWG, are they seeing similar results there?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, John. I'll take that one, it's Richard. So yes, I think you hit it on the head. We're really comparing to last year results of 92% for risk-based in Lifestyle. Whereas our long-term targets, 96% to 98% that we put out, we came in at 99%. There was some increase in expenses in there, some onetime increase in expenses in there and a little bit higher non-cat loss ratio. But for the full year, we fully expect to be within the bands that we've talked about previously.","Alan Colberg","Yes. And on The Warranty Group, we'll provide a summary of their Q1 sometime in the next few weeks. But as was mentioned, all indications are their business continues to progress as we expect, with good momentum in the vehicle business.","John Nadel","If I can sneak one more in; just -- because this has become such a significant topic in the industry here in the last couple of weeks. But just a question on your old long-term care insurance business; I know that was sold to John Hancock something like 18 years ago via a co-insurance transaction back...","Alan Colberg","Yes, that's correct, John, yes.","John Nadel","But I just want to confirm, and I think it's helpful for folks if you can confirm, that you have no obligation related to that block of business. Correct?","Richard Dziadzio","That business is, I would say, it's on our books. It's reinsured. It's reinsured to, I would say, a party of very high credit standing. And in addition to that, the reserves of the assets across the reserves are held in trust. So we're feeling extremely secure about that business.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.","Mark Hughes","Did I hear correctly that in the Connected Living, the favorable client contract term amendment, was that kind of a onetime boost? And if I -- and if that's right, how much was that?","Alan Colberg","So yes and no is the answer to that. Ordinary course for us is we're routinely going through all of our client contracts and truing up, collecting if there are things that aren't performing as we agreed. So that's pretty normal course. The reason we called it out is it was a little bit bigger than we normally see in a quarter, but nowhere near the size of the one from the first quarter of '17.","Mark Hughes","Okay. So less than that, but you haven't quantified it?","Alan Colberg","We haven't quantified it.","Mark Hughes","At least for public purposes.","Alan Colberg","Right.","Mark Hughes","The mobile trade-in volume, I think you suggested, was down in Q1 and it looks like industries shipments have been soft lately. Any body language on the last couple of months? Is that kind of still same trajectory? Possibly better?","Alan Colberg","Yes, I think the important thing in our Mobile and Lifestyle business, as you saw, we had a strong first quarter despite relatively weak mobile trade-in volumes because we have many other sources of revenue and earnings in mobile. So we've weathered now many quarters in a row of pretty soft trade-in volumes with continued strong overall growth for our lifestyle business. We -- as we look forward, we still expect later this year that we'll see a pickup in mobile trade-in volumes but if we do or don't, we continue to have strong momentum in Lifestyle independent of that.","Mark Hughes","Understood. The KDDI enrollment is quite strong in the quarter. Is -- anything we should think about in terms of the pattern of growth there? Is it kind of front-end loaded and new relationships are getting a nice pop? Or is this something that you'll see sustained pickup? How should we think about that?","Alan Colberg","I think we're going to continue to see continued strong growth in that relationship for the foreseeable future. And at this point, our relationship with them only covers one major manufacturer, and we have opportunity to expand that to other manufacturers. So I think we feel good about how that program is going so far, with significant growth over time in front of us.","Mark Hughes","And with respect to the T-Mobile situation, what's the latest take on your opportunity there?","Alan Colberg","Yes, as we've talked about, T-Mobile is an important partner for us. We've been embedded in their operations and a key part of their Un-carrier strategy for many years now. But we feel well positioned with an important client, however things play out in the marketplace over time.","Mark Hughes","Any opportunity to take share as a consequence of this?","Alan Colberg","Hard to speculate on what will actually ever happen with the potential merger that's been announced. But the good news for us is we have a strong partnership with T-Mobile and that creates opportunities over time.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder Bhullar","First, I just wanted to clarify your comments on buybacks. I think you had initially said that you'd evaluate buybacks after the closing. And are you implying that it's unlikely that you will buy back stock this year, even in the second half?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So a couple of comments on that. One, as you know, what we've said is that, as of now, we think buybacks are unlikely in 2018. But we've said we will revisit that post close. We'll take a look at our capital and cash position post-closing. Importantly, we have a very long history and a very strong track record of creating value for our shareholders, and a large part of that is returning capital. That hasn't changed. The only thing that's happened this year is we've effectively brought forward the share buybacks that we had planned for this year by issuing 3 million fewer shares as part of purchasing The Warranty Group. Well, we will revisit post close. But for now, the expectation is that we don't anticipate further buybacks this year.","Jamminder Bhullar","And then on the mortgage solutions business, obviously, there's been some industry headwinds as well. But it doesn't seem like the industry environment's as weak as your results would suggest. So are there things that are going on in the market that's sort of -- or related to your business, where you've been able to find reasons where you're performing worse? And what's your view on the likelihood of stabilization and\/or a recovery in that business?","Alan Colberg","Well, I think our perspective at this point is that it's going to be remaining challenging for the balance of the year. With that said, we've taken aggressive expense actions, and we'll continue to take appropriate expense actions. The real challenge we've been dealing with is both the market and then, as we brought the companies together, we had some client issues that cost us some volume last year. With that said, we're starting to see some good business opportunities. In fact, we're onboarding several new clients right now on our field services business. So what we tried to message in the outlook is we don't see it recovering this year, we see it remaining challenging. But we feel like we've taken appropriate actions to really stabilize that business.","Jamminder Bhullar","And then just lastly, on the placement rates in the LTI business. And I realize, long term, there's not a lot of visibility on what happens with that. But any reason to believe that beyond 2018, if the housing market stays strong, that it would -- it wouldn't continue to decline, maybe at a slower pace?","Alan Colberg","Yes -- no. Certainly, there is a natural kind of bottom to placement rate. Because, important to remember, some of the homes that we insure are actually the consumer choosing to buy our product, and it's actually a pretty significant portion of what we do now in lender-placed. But I think as we get into 2019, we will see placement rates moderate even if the housing market remained strong, i.e., the rate of decline will moderate. Fortunately though, we've been taking significant action in the investment we've been making in technology that will really create, we expect, cost savings in 2019 beyond what should allow us to perform in that business even if we continue to have placement rate declines.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners.","Gary Ransom","Most of my questions have been answered but on -- I had a question on the accounting treatment after the deal of the amortization of intangibles. And I just wondered if you could give us any estimate of the size of that? Or -- and just to clarify whether that's actually in your definition of operating or whether that's below the line?","Richard Dziadzio","Yes, Gary, it's Richard. In terms of intangibles, at the time of the acquisition, the first announcement, we talked about $30 million, $35 million per year in terms of intangible amortization. No update as of the call today. I have no reason to believe that there's going to be a change from that. And as I mentioned earlier, when we get to close, that's when we'll do our opening balance sheet. And that would be a part of the operating earnings that we have to date, the amortization of intangibles that we have from various acquisitions is -- goes through that as well. We are, however, as we said in the past, looking at ways to show the market the cash-generation power that this company has, and we'll be updating that as part of the update later this year that Alan mentioned earlier.","Alan Colberg","And Gary, just one other thing on that. In the outlook that we provided on The Warranty Group, where we said the deal was modestly accretive on a run-rate basis with the synergies that we expect, we included in that analysis the amortization. So it's modestly accretive, including the amortization that Richard just highlighted.","Gary Ransom","Right. Okay. And just one other broad-based question on your comment about migrating one big housing client on to your one platform. Could you maybe give us a little bit more color on what that means for that client and then what it means for you in terms of expense?","Alan Colberg","Yes. So our environment today is complicated. It's a legacy of many different systems that were built either by us or through acquisitions. So in order to effectively serve clients and consumers today, it's a fairly complicated training process a representative has to go through. This new system is a massively superior consumer and client experience. It's a single system that has all the information. We can have a new representative up and running much quicker than in the past. And as we install it, we'll be able to take a lot of cost and complexity out of our business, with a better outcome for our clients and their consumers.","Gary Ransom","And your intention is to get everyone on this platform?","Alan Colberg","Yes. We've been working with our clients for many years now. In fact, the system was designed with a client counsel that provided continuous input into what's needed to operate their business better. And so in the short term, it's actually hurting our expenses because we're carrying both the existing system and we're starting to invest and we've been investing in this new system. But that's why we've said, beginning later this year and especially in 2019 and beyond, we should have significant improvement in our expense ratio as we're able to get a critical mass of clients on the new system.","Operator","Our last question is coming from John Nadel from UBS.","John Nadel","So, I just wanted to follow-up on one of the comments you made, Alan, which was -- I found interesting, that a good portion of the lender-placed -- the placed policies are actually sort of voluntarily chosen as opposed to forced placed. And so if I think about the 1.74% placement rate -- and I know you guys talked about it declining at least through the end of this year. So give or take, about 600,000 policies enforced, can you give us a sense what portion of that 600,000 policies is actually voluntary as opposed to force placed?","Alan Colberg","So, yes. Yes. So John, I'm not going to answer it exactly. But the way to think about this is before the crisis, if you go back to the '05, '06 type range, we had placement rates, call it, 1.5%, a little bit around that range, and that was largely from voluntary purchase by consumers. And that was in an era when our rates were substantially higher than voluntary products. You fast forward to today, we've completely redone the product over the last five years. Our product is actually relatively competitive now with the existing voluntary products. And so what we're finding now is we're having greater consumer choice to pick our product, and then there's always going to be some level of volume that comes from the foreclosed inventory, the seriously delinquent, that's move into foreclosure, that's moved into REO. Which is why we feel pretty well positioned that even the placement rate was going to continue to modulate a little bit, which it could if the housing market was very strong; we're not far from the bottom at this point.","John Nadel","Great, thank you.","Alan Colberg","Thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call. We're pleased with our first quarter performance and believe we're off to a strong start for the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter earnings call in early August. Please reach out to Suzanne Shepherd and Sean Moshier for any follow-up questions. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"2671":["Assurant, Inc.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. There will be an opportunity to ask questions following today\u2019s presentation. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Melissa Kivett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Melissa Kivett","Thanks very much and good morning everyone. We look forward t discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results with you. Joining me for Assurant\u2019s conference call are Rob Pollock, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Peninger, our Chief Financial Officer and Chris Pagano, our Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer.","Yesterday afternoon we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter and full year results. Both the release and corresponding supplemental financial information are available at assurant.com. You may have noticed that our news release now includes some information you have previously received on the call.","Today, we\u2019ll focus on the highlights and priorities of each of our businesses and provide more time for Q&A. We\u2019ll start today\u2019s call with brief remarks from Rob and Mike and Chris participating in the Q&A session.","Some of the statements we make on today\u2019s calls may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday\u2019s news release as well as our SEC reports including our 2010 Form 10-K, available at assurant.com.","Today\u2019s call will contain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the Company\u2019s performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplemental information posted at assurant.com.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob.","Rob Pollock","Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results in the quarter. We have grown in areas we have identified as attractive for our future success. At the same time, we continued to generate substantial free cash flow from operations. This provides us with a strong and flexible capital position. We measure our success with three important financial metrics.","First, operating return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income for AOCI. We reported a 13.8% annualized return during the fourth quarter which increased the full year return to 9.9%.","Second, growth in book value per diluted share excluding AOCI. We saw an increase of about 14% for the year. Third, growth in revenues defined by earned premiums and fee income.","Overall, total revenues declined by about 3% in 2011 compared to 2010. In the quarter, we achieved modest growth on both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. The areas we have targeted for future growth are linked to broad social and economic trends.","They include the growing importance of wireless mobile devices to consumers. Increases in rental housing versus home ownership, consumer\u2019s desire for more choice and greater affordability in their health insurance plans, and employers moving away from payment for benefits to sponsorship of voluntary employee funded products. We achieved growth in each of these areas in 2011 and believe they offer great opportunities for our future.","Now let me make some specific comments about the environment, each of our businesses face. I\u2019ll begin with Assurant Solutions. Consumer spending remains sluggish in the US and economic uncertainty persists in Europe. However, revenues from our wireless and service contract offerings, especially in Latin America are expanding. While Solutions expects overall modest premium growth in 2012, we are disappointed that one of our domestic wireless clients will be leaving.","We are in discussions with them concerning the timing. Nonetheless we remain optimistic. We continue to allocate resources to wireless due to its underlying growth trajectory and its intersection with our core capabilities. Turning to Specialty Property, there are fewer mortgage loans originating in the US and foreclosures are projected to increase. Despite these trends, our lender-placed insurance tracking system and product offerings are helping us win business and serve existing clients.","Some of whom are growing their servicing portfolios. As we have communicated, we are not party to the proposed settlement between the State Attorney General and Mortgage Servicers. We understand that the proposed terms of the settlement focused primarily on foreclosure practices and loan modifications.","Insurance is regulated at the state level. We have regular interaction with the different insurance departments. Occasionally, we receive information request. Last fall, we received an information request not as a penal from the New York Department of Financial Services. We are co-operating fully and are virtually complete with a few data items being produced in the next couple of weeks.","Our lender-placed products provide value to consumers. For example, in the third quarter we paid claims of more than $75 million on 10,000 homes that were impacted by Hurricane Irene. This underscores that our product provides value and helps customers in their time of need.","At Assurant Health, we\u2019ve redesigned many of our products in response to healthcare reforms. We also focus on providing affordability and choices of benefits and providers to our customers. Our new relationship with Aetna Signature Administrators broadens our array of healthcare providers and improves affordability of our major medical products.","At the same time, it improves engagement with our distributors. During 2012, our products will continue to emphasize affordability and choice, even as we continue to implement healthcare reform changes.","Turning next to Assurant\u2019s employee benefits. Small employers are not growing payrolls. Until that happens, growth in our benefits business will be challenging. Meanwhile, we continue to build our capabilities in the voluntary benefits market and focus on our specialized distribution. To summarize our businesses are well positioned in their targeted markets. Our strong capital position, excellence in risk management and ability to generate free cash provide the foundation for continued progress.","Assurant\u2019s track record of adapting to changing markets is well established. Our priorities are clear to make Assurant more efficient to focus on long-term profitable growth and to generate superior returns for our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike.","Mike Peninger","Thanks, Rob. Now let\u2019s discuss a few highlights and priorities for each of our business segments. I\u2019ll start with Assurant Solutions. During the year, Solutions grew its international presence particularly in the Latin American wireless space. Client contract renewals remained strong driven by our ability to respond to evolving customer needs.","Preneed\u2019s sales increased in 2011 over a strong performance in 2010, as we continued to deepen our relationship with SCI. Total earned premiums and fees were virtually flat with the prior year despite significant tap line pressure caused by previously discussed run-off clients. The major priorities for Solutions in 2012 are to continue to grow the Wireless business, improve international profitability and drive down expenses in the businesses which are not growing.","Specialty Property\u2019s results reflect the continued ability to win new accounts through our superior tracking capabilities and our overall programs. Our alignment with market leaders, specifically specialty servicers has allowed us to gain new portfolios which have help to offset declining number of loans in the overall marketplace. This was evident during the fourth quarter as our clients were awarded new loan portfolios mitigating the overall decrease in the number of tracked loans. As usual, we placed a significant portion of our reinsurance program in January, including our Catastrophe Bonds, we have finalized about 70% of our total program for the year. We will provide a complete update when the program is completed in June.","We are pleased with the integration of the SureDeposit acquisition, which has allowed us to expand our offerings in the multi-family housing market and we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential of the rental market.","Assurant Health made great progress in 2011. We believe that we are well positioned to successfully navigate additional healthcare reform provisions. A particularly noteworthy change that will affect health earnings this year is the treatment of loss development relative to year-end reserves.","In 2011, favorable development from 2010 reserves for policies subject to the MLR flowed into our reported earnings. In 2012, any favorable development relative to 2011 reserves will increase CMLR rebate liability instead of flowing into earnings. Our 2011 operating cost dropped significantly as we drive toward a streamlined structure that will allow us to succeed under healthcare reforms.","Sales of health access and supplemental products continue to grow in the fourth quarter. We expect that trend to continue in 2012 and we also expect improvement in our core major medical sales as we implement our new provider network contract with Aetna Signature Administrators.","At Assurant Employee Benefits, the lack of payroll growth remains a significant headwind. In addition, during the fourth quarter we observed an uptick in our disability incidence rates which had remained relatively stable over the past few years. It\u2019s too soon to say whether this quarter was an aberration or the start of a trend, but we are carefully reviewing the data and we\u2019ll take corrective action if warranted.","Our strategic focus on distribution through key brokers in our expanded offerings continue to improve sales of voluntary products. In addition, savings from expense initiatives at Employee Benefits are being redeployed into targeted growth initiatives.","Moving on to corporate matters, our investment portfolio continued perform well during the challenging 2011 environment while portfolio yields continued decline due to low new money rates, a relatively stable liability structure, and conservative investment approach allow us to maintain yield from current investments for as long as possible.","During 2012, we will maintain or risk profile and look for opportunities to invest operating cash flows at attractive risk adjusted returns. In 2012, we expect to return a substantial portion of free cash flow to our shareholders via repurchases and dividends. In order to generate sustained long-term shareholder value, we must also make disciplined investments in our businesses and look for new opportunities to drive profitable growth.","And with that, we can move into the question and answer portion of the call. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer-Session","Operator","(Operator instructions) We\u2019ll have our first question from Mark Finkelstein, with Evercore Partners.","Rob Pollock","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi, good morning. I guess I have a few questions. Firstly, the domestic wireless loss, what was the size of the premium related to that?","Mike Peninger","We haven\u2019t disclosed that. It\u2019s just one of several of our clients Mark.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, I guess, the overall expectation is for growth in Solutions premium kind of modest growth, would that assume kind of growth internationally and maybe decline domestically, is that the way to think about that?","Mike Peninger","I think that, the domestic product will continue to run off. I think we would expect probably some modest growth domestically on the service contract side and growth internationally and the outlook takes into account the client we mentioned.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, fair enough. And then the comment on kind of spending free cash flow on dividends and buybacks, does that assume that, kind of 2012 earnings will kind of be used on that.","And then how should we think about the growing excess capital on balance sheet? I mean, the $760 million was assuming larger than I expected it to be at year end particularly given the high buybacks in the fourth quarter. How should we think about that and what \u2013 when would you look at that and say, maybe we start paying that down above and beyond investments for growth as you characterized in your comments as well as in the press release?","Rob Pollock","Yes, so let me make a few comments here and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris and Mike and let them add, but first I guess I\u2019d start with the fact that we\u2019ve got growth going on which it\u2019s modest but small amounts means that we are not going to be able to \u2013 we need to leave some capital generation or some of the earnings generation back in the businesses because the rating agency formulas that guide or capital requirements go up a little bit.","That being said, I think we are still going to be in that range of being able to dividend out the operating earnings of the different companies. So, there may be a little bit on the margin, but I think that\u2019s a fair assumption we can make. Maybe now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris and he can kind of take you through because I think actually that number went down a little during the year, over the last couple years, maybe it\u2019s gone up modestly he can just give you some history on that.","Mike Peninger","Sure, good morning, Mark. Maybe just, maybe I start with a little bit of a reconciliation for the fourth quarter and then talk a little bit about the full year 2011 and then 2012 going forward. During the fourth quarter, we began the fourth quarter with $640 million of holding company capital.","We took $270 million of operating dividends, keep in mind when you think about operating dividends relative to net operating income, we made about a $180 million. During the fourth quarter, we disclosed during the third quarter conference call that we felt like we had about $50 million of segment earnings still in the segments ready to be dividended up.","So I think about 230 there, the 180 plus the 50, and then again every year we look to dividend up any available capital from the segments to the holding company where it has maximum flexibility. So we found some other pockets of capital that we are able to send up to the holding company. And we paid out a $190 million to shareholders, 17 or so in dividends, 173 in share repurchases, and then there were some corporate inflows of about $40 million that gets to the $760 for the full year.","For the full year, we took about $520 million of dividends from the operating segments. Keep in mind we made NOI, the NOI was 530. We spent 45 of that from property\u2019s earnings for the SureDeposit acquisition. And then returned about 600 in total for the year giving you with some outflows and corporate getting you to the 760 number for year-end.","Just a couple things around \u201912, I think the key here is going to be a continuation of the discipline that we\u2019ve shown and the willingness to return capital to shareholders, which we\u2019ve shown over the last two years. When you think about, since the beginning of 2010, we\u2019ve returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, 140 of dividend and $1.60 billion in share repurchases.","The real story though is the operating cash flow from the segments. I mean, when you think about returning $1.2 billion over a two year period and having your holding company capital position go up from roughly 710 at year end 2009 to 760 year end 2011, I mean that\u2019s in my mind, that\u2019s the real story. Going forward we are going to continue to maintain the discipline.","I think, the capital deployment question is one we ask every quarter, it\u2019s a very dynamic process. The answer for the last eight quarters has been the same, largely driven by strong capital flows and an attractive share price relative to book and that\u2019s going to continue to drive our process for 2012.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi, thank you.","Rob Pollock","Good morning, Jimmy.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi, just a couple of questions. First on the placement rate and especially property business has kept inching higher. We\u2019d assume that that would go down at some point. So what are you seeing?","What are your expectations for that and what\u2019s been driving it? And the second, if you look at the Employee Benefits margins, excluding the reserve release, it seems like the margins are a lot weaker than where they\u2019ve been, so if you could talk about what products specifically cause that and just if it is disability then, what you are seeing in terms of loss and recovery trends in the disability business?","Rob Pollock","Sure, let\u2019s start on the property side and the placement rates, we don\u2019t have great insight into what will happen moving forward, but we do know what happened in the last quarter is a client came onboard with a number of loans. It was a flat cancel meaning that all the premium came to us as the servicer took over the portfolio and the placement rate on that portfolio was quite a bit higher than our portfolio in general Jimmy.","So that drove a big part of that placement rate. The other thing I guess, I\u2019d say there is obviously, just kind of all the things going on certainly you have a growing number of loans that are seriously delinquent at some point in time we think that will work its way through the pipeline and that will be the catalyst for placement rates declining. On disability side, Mike do you want to comment?","Mike Peninger","Sure on disability, Jimmy, I think \u2013 or excuse me on Employee Benefits, I think the driver of the lower results were \u2013 was disability and as we\u2019ve talked for a number of quarters, the recovery rates at Employee Benefits how quickly we can get claimants back to work have lengthened a little bit. It\u2019s been a little more challenging in the difficult economy to do that.","Up until the fourth quarter, we had not seen any particular change in incident rates in disability number of new claims and that\u2019s where we saw a bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter. And if you think about disability you have to remember it\u2019s a sort of a non credible coverage because of the low incidence rates. So it takes us some time to look at the experience and determine if you are seeing some sort of a pattern or an if it\u2019s just a temporary aberration.","So we have lot of tools and things to look at that and we are dissecting the block and as we determine that there is actually a sustainable trend then we\u2019ll have to take corrective action. So that\u2019s the story of disability. I think the good news at Employee Benefits is that dental experience has continued to improve and we feel good about the progress in that coverage.","And then I think the final piece of benefits is, life insurance where I think we are suffering a little bit quarter-over-quarter in comparison because we had some exceptionally good mortality in 2010. I would say in 2011, good but not spectacularly good, so you just got a little bit of a quarter-over-quarter phenomenon there.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan","And then just one more the Specialty Property business, as all the enquiries going on, is there any way in which the investigations have affected your business thus far like if you are going out seeking price increases or doing anything else or its affected your ability to price the business appropriately, or you\u2019ve seen an impact on how you operate in the business?","Mike Peninger","No, we haven\u2019t Jimmy and, one thing I just want to make sure, I point out is, there have been many misconceptions over this product. We\u2019ve actually put a white paper up in our web to define how things work which I think can clarify a lot of the statements that have been made that. Certainly we don\u2019t believe are true about us.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll have our next question from Ed Spehar, Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Rob Pollock","Good morning Ed.","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. I guess I\u2019d like to follow up on the question about pricing and Specialty Property, two things, first I believe you have said that, when a lot of the rate actions that you look for in a year will occur sometime after the storm season.","So I\u2019m wondering if you could give us anything specific on the amount of rate increases which you\u2019ve asked for what\u2019s been accept and is there any change in the acceptance rating change in the level of the questioning that you are getting from regulators regarding rate filings anything that\u2019s different specifically rate filings, because I think you\u2019ve \u2013 I think this is the time of the year where you\u2019d be doing that? And then I have one follow-up.","Rob Pollock","Sure, so we are going through our normal process. I guess if you think about last year\u2019s storm season, a little bit different than traditionally just a big hurricane season. We had the tornadoes earlier in the year. The actual filings that take place over the course of years, we\u2019ve got filings in process, I\u2019d say we are seeing nothing out of the ordinary in terms of how we are moving forward.","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay and then one follow-up. You talk about in the white paper and I think you said in the past that you believe your rates are among the lower rates in the lender-place market. Can you give us some sense, I mean first of all, how do you figure that out, is it from state filings? And secondly, could you give us some sense of how much your rates might differ on average from your competitors?","Rob Pollock","I think we\u2019ve put out broad comparisons of where we are versus the underlying voluntary carriers Ed, and certainly Gene and his team have done some macro analysis that makes us feel our rates are lower.","Anecdotally, I\u2019m sure that, that three can be situations where that might not be the case, because everybody has slightly different rating formulas by geographies and how they act, but it\u2019s basically a process where we can look at things in the marketplace sometimes, in situations where there may be flat cancellations we can see the rate charts and we know we are cheaper.","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll proceed next to Steven Schwartz, Raymond James and Associates.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Hey good morning everybody.","Rob Pollock","Hey, good morning Steven.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Good morning. If I can, a couple of follow-ups and some of my own. Just on the capital question, holding company capital some in 60, why are you considering these days to be a necessary buffer?","Chris Pagano","The buffer continues to be the 250 that is something we established back in early \u201909 as part of our enterprise as management initiative. Keep in mind, again my point earlier, we ask the question on a regular basis the appropriateness in the buffer, the answer has been the same.","But going forward that could change one of the things that we\u2019ve also talked about in the last couple of years is our desire to be above the buffer as we head into the CAT season sort of a seasonal buffer. If you want to think of it that way. But that\u2019s a question that we are going to continue ask, but at this point it\u2019s still $250 million. So the 760 has a five, ten deployable number to it.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Okay, but it seems from at least what you are saying Chris is that, you want to spend your operating income. So you wind up at that five, ten again I guess is that an accurate statement?","Chris Pagano","Again, kind of the thought process here is, in general we believe we can get operating earnings out of the segments in the form of dividends up to the holding company. Now operating earnings are a function of what goes transpire during the course of the year.","Rob mentioned the fact that if we do see growth we may need to keep some of the earnings back to support that growth at the individual segments. And then again, Mike made the comment about the need to make some disciplined investment. So the deployment priorities also involve the search for the disciplined search for growth and that is an ongoing question that we ask.","And at this point, I think what we\u2019ve seen in the last two years, given our criteria around acquisitions that the best use of the deployable capital has been to return it to shareholders and given where the share price that\u2019s traded relative to book and what we think is a very attractive level, share repurchase has been the dominant form of deployment of capital.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Okay, moving on, Rob, I think you mentioned the new customer had an extraordinarily high placement rate. Do you have a sense of what the placement rate would have done in Specialty Property without that customer?","Rob Pollock","Without the client, I don\u2019t have that with me. My guess is it was in the range of where it\u2019s been probably flat.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Okay, and I think maybe somebody explain the math, if we have, is the market finally curves out and we start to have a lot of foreclosures, how does the math work? That would take your, all else equal that would take your loans down? Would that also take the placement rate down?","Rob Pollock","Okay, so maybe a good way to think about this Steven is first, if it\u2019s Fannie or Freddie, okay and it moves to an OREO status, we are going to lose that, because they don\u2019t insure all that business. If it\u2019s not a Fannie or Freddie loan, on most of our customers we have an OREO program it will move from kind of that individual policy to a bulk policy provided to the owner of the properties.","So, you can think about it is, if it\u2019s placed today and moves in this Fannie Freddie, we are going to lose it. Otherwise, it\u2019s conceivable that could remain with us, but it\u2019s going to have a shorter ten year because obviously they are going to love to get the property sold.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Right, okay, good. I forgot about the Fannie, Freddie thing. And then just on the \u2013 and just two quick ones. The lost customer on the wireless whereas you don\u2019t want to say how big, do you know why?","Rob Pollock","Yeah, I think kind of a couple of things. One is we have pricing discipline on how we approach things. I think the other is, they had an integration of some things that are different than what we had to offer and it was evaluated in a holistic sense.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Okay, and then lastly just on the reinsurance that you just put in, in which you are looking at, what\u2019s your thought on rate online? Is it going to be flat? Is it going to be higher?","Rob Pollock","Yeah, I think Chris can probably comment in more detail, I think Steven, we are seeing a slightly harder market and then we\u2019ve got growth in our portfolio. So I think both of those things are going to drive up the premium a bit. I don\u2019t know Chris if you want to amplify on that?","Chris Pagano","Yeah I think in general, between the January traditional placement and then more importantly the CAT bond we just placed, we\u2019ve seen and what we think is about a 10% to 15% price increase all other things equal. We feel very good about the fact that we\u2019ve got 70% place now heading into the June placement.","Again that\u2019s part of our long-term strategy is to place at multiple points during the year. And again as Mike mentioned, this is not apples-to-apples. This is not a reinsurance we are going to buy, it\u2019s gone up versus last year, given the growth and the product. So that will factor in but, and again we\u2019ll give you the full breakdown when we complete the June placement and a couple quarters, a couple months rather.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James and Associates","Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll proceed next to John Nadel, Sterne Agee.","Rob Pollock","Good morning, John.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Hi, thanks. Good morning everybody. I\u2019ll start here. If I look at Specialty Property, you have that line item that shows the amount of premiums that you ceded to your clients and to the governments and then I think if I recall correctly the government piece is the flood program.","But I was hoping you could tell us or give us a sense anyway, what the portion is of that line item that ceded to clients, I\u2019m guessing as things shifts here, the servicers are very likely to no longer be able to take on that premium is likely to come back to you as we look forward. So I\u2019m just trying to gauge that.","Rob Pollock","Yeah, that\u2019s just something we haven\u2019t provided John. Obviously, that will all become clear if what you think happens, happens.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay, no willingness even to give us a sense for 20% or 30% or 40%?","Rob Pollock","Just not something we\u2019ve disclosed.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay. There has also been and I know your white paper addresses this a little bit, but I was hoping maybe you could go into a little bit more detail. I\u2019ve heard from some who believe that insured values have not come down nearly fast enough relative to home prices nationally and that, as a result, the premiums in dollars not necessarily premium per thousand dollars of coverage.","But the premiums in dollars are too high and this is not necessarily just an issue for your business but maybe for home owners\u2019 insurance business broadly. Can you just give some commentary around that? Because I think that\u2019s a misplaced view, but I\u2019m interested in your opinion.","Chris Pagano","Sure, I think a couple different things here. The first is, we work off whatever the prior the voluntary carriers coverage amount is makes it, nothing we are passing judgment on, we are just taking the program they have and extending that same amount of structural coverage that was in place in the past.","Second, obviously there is a big difference between home prices today and the cost to build for repair when things happen and those are at a different relationship than we\u2019ve ever seen historically. I think those things over time will move back to more normal levels.","The third thing I think with respect to our coverage that often gets locked as well is, we have a dual interest policy. And what that means is, when repairs take place, we are often in a situation when the repair takes place that allows the home owner to stay in the home and we think that\u2019s quite important as well, whereas if that was just covering the loan amount. The person who has got the mortgage loan gets covered but that\u2019s not enough to take care of all the damage that\u2019s been done. That just doesn\u2019t seem like the right approach.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","That\u2019s an interesting one. Thank you. And then, I guess, I almost feel silly asking this question maybe it\u2019s a bit of a follow-up to Mark\u2019s, given you bought back 12.5% of your shares in 2011, but with over $500 million of excess capital, above your 250 cushion, I mean is there any really reason the pace of your buybacks couldn\u2019t accelerate further versus 2011 and I guess related to that I know the Board, Rob, typically makes a decision on the dividend in the spring but have you given any, at least early consideration to maybe a more significant dividend hike to put it may be truly competitive dividend yield on the stocks?","Rob Pollock","Sure, this is all part of that disciplined capital management strategy we talk about John and these are all things that we look at periodically. I think, Chris and his team I think, all we have to do is look at the history, it\u2019s very disciplined. It\u2019s very oriented toward value and its value-oriented towards the shareholder. Chris, I don\u2019t know if there are other things you like to add in there?","Chris Pagano","I guess the only other thing I\u2019d point out is, our focus on consistency. Again doing things the way we\u2019ve done them quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year using the 10b5-1 program to repurchase stock being in the market not doing accelerated, because that suggests some sort of point in time view of ours. But the key being to where there is deployable capital that the best use of it to give it back to shareholders and that\u2019 what we are going to do.","The discussion with the board again consistency every year during the second quarter, we have that discussion and we are going to do that again this year. So, I mean, and the other point I want to make is, this is a dynamic process, okay. This is not something that we don\u2019t just automatically ask the questions, the same questions, quarter-in quarter-out. We happen to be coming up with the same answers in the last eight quarters and that\u2019s the action that we\u2019ve been taking.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay. And then, last one just a quick one in Benefits. I think your press release mentioned that you lost about $40 million in premiums in the January 1 renewal on two different cases. Just the interest is, if you could give us a sense for how competitive that was, if you were looking for a rate increase of let\u2019s say X, how much of a discount did that business leave you for relative to X?","Mike Peninger","Yeah, I wasn\u2019t quite \u2013 there were some quite issue on these John and it was a client that was having relatively poor experience and we were essentially trying to price correctly for the experience that was sort of a loss ratio driven thing.","The other one was one of the turnkey reinsurance clients that we\u2019ve talked about in the BRMS business. That client decided to essentially change his program and retain more of the risk themselves. So they are recapturing the thing, there wasn\u2019t any dissatisfaction, and that they thought we are doing a fine job for them.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay, thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Mark Hughes, SunTrust.","Rob Pollock","Good morning Mark.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust","Thank you very much. The voluntary benefits, you say that success, you had a lot of success in new sales. How big is that of your total sales within benefits and how quickly that it grow?","Rob Pollock","It accounts for roughly I think 50% of our sales Mark, and that\u2019s grown steadily and that\u2019s where Employee Benefits is investing their resources and as I think I said in my comments that they are taking some of the expense savings there and redeploying them into voluntary investments that are adding to distribution. So the pace of the voluntary growth we feel pleased with.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust","Right, and then you\u2019ve obviously had a lot of success taking share in Specialty Property. How is your visibility or how do you feel about the opportunities ahead to continue to take share was there something special about the last year or two that allows you to capture more or conditions just is there good going forward?","Mike Peninger","I mean, we think we have a better mousetrap here. That being said, you know there is one client we are not going to get and that represents a large share of the market. We think everything else is a fair game.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust","And then the disability claims anything you can say about end-markets, was that\u2019s really broad based in terms of types of customers that your serving like the policyholders in terms of industry as distribution?","Mike Peninger","Yeah, I think it was fairly, - as I said earlier it\u2019s very difficult to look at one quarter of disability experience and draw anything definitive. We didn\u2019t see any particularly segment of the block. I would say that there were a bit a higher than normal large claims this quarter sometimes than disability you can get some variants in the reserves on a high benefit claim can be quite large and so you can get a little bit of volatility introduced there. But nothing in terms of a particular segment of the block.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Chris Giovanni, Goldman Sachs.","Rob Pollock","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Thanks so much. A question on health. In the outlook you point into kind of reduction in expenses again in 2012m but 4Q it look like it was the first time, we hadn\u2019t seen sort of a sequential decline in expenses. So wondering first if there was anything seasonal in 4Q that drove the uptick? And then next, what type of expense saves further do you think you can take out?","Mike Peninger","Yeah, a couple things. One of the things I just pointed out is, we have both short-term and long-term incentive plans that get trued up at the end of the year. We finished stronger than we were thinking at the end of the three quarters and as a result, our accruals went up and that\u2019s pretty much across the board. Okay, so that\u2019s a little anomaly in the fourth quarter expenses.","The health people themselves tremendously focused on continued simplification. So they have efforts underway to reduce systems to look at anything that isn\u2019t customer facing and ask questions of why do have these things? We\u2019ve taken out a lot. I think they see opportunities for more, but it\u2019s harder. We have some things to deal with, with healthcare reform we mentioned. One of the biggest of which is just dealing with the addition of holding requirements associated with ICD 10 I guess or I may have my \u2013 wrong.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s right.","Chris Pagano","Fundamentally, the good news is that, a small piece of that we are actually going to be able to count as quality improvement on MLR that was again kind of a new news thing in the fourth quarter. So, again they are very focused on the expense side. They are very focused on providing affordability and choice to customers and we are hopeful we are going to see sales continue to increase in this business.","Mike Peninger","And I would just add, Chris, I think Rob sort of commented on this, but certainly all, that\u2019s easy to get or near term expense savings have been attained at Health. They\u2019ve done a great job. What we are working on now is really that hard detailed simplification of the internal process, simplification of the systems environment and all of that is just detailed and it takes time, they are really on a great track there. So they do feel they can get more.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and then back in 2010 you guys made the decision to stay in the Health business despite sort of what was going on with healthcare reform and results I assume you\u2019ve been better than many. So do you think the success that you are having now makes this business easier to sell or should we kind of take the Aetna contract as a sign that you guys are in this business for the long run?","Mike Peninger","Well again, we start all our assessments around two fundamental themes. Is it the Specialty business and can we get to attractive returns for our shareholders. I\u2019d say on both those counts we are feeling quite good. Had the progress we\u2019ve made, we are not to the returns we want yet, but we\u2019ve made quite a bit of progress.","We think that the Aetna deal is a great deal for us around a number of different dimensions and strengthens our position not only with end-consumers but also with our distribution partners. So, we are very encouraged on how we are moving forward in this business. ","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and then just, sorry if you addressed this already. But I think you had met with Best towards the end of the quarter and in the past it\u2019s been you\u2019ve been able to dividend up 100% of the earnings. Has that changed at all as you move into 2012?","Mike Peninger","The fourth quarter, best performed and completed its annual review in the fourth quarter. Very pleased with the results. Keep in mind, agency discussions are not once a year or even once a quarter.","They occur on a regular basis. I think to the extent that rating agency views evolve, we like to participate in those discussions, react accordingly. Again, comes back to capitalizing the operating entities appropriately given, not only the rating agency\u2019s views but our views which are a byproduct of our risk management approach.","So, right now, as of today we don\u2019t anticipate any changes but again it\u2019s early in the year, we are going to file our statutory returns and make some determinations around ordinary dividend capacity et cetera. But, it\u2019s an ongoing discussion and one that we participate actively in, are very partnerships we think with the rating agencies.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks so much. That helps.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jeffrey Schuman, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Rob Pollock","Good morning Jeff.","Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Thanks, good morning. Few questions on Specialty Property. First of all we look at loans track, down about 2% year-over-year, can you give us some sense of the interplay between how much the market moved and how much your share moved?","Mike Peninger","Well, a couple of things. The first is that the loans that are \u2013 we have are reported to us by the servicers and we found that to be a rather fluid number. So it\u2019s not like we have a perfect inventory on these things all the time Jeff. That being said, we know that we added a couple of clients during the year.","And the additions, there was a number of loans we thought we are going to take over and then there was a number we actually took over which reflects just that pay off, or foreclosure, all those dynamics going on in the market. Maybe a good way to think about it is, what\u2019s happening to the overall inventory. We think that\u2019s gone down by several million loans and we think we\u2019ve gone down by a smaller percentage.","Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Next on the OREO, if you look at the OREO penetration of gross written, it\u2019s been coming down a fair amount, is that a reflection of less new flows into OREO or is it more a reflection of stuff coming out the back side of OREO?","Mike Peninger","Well, you mentioned two and I think there is a third. So those are two of the dynamics, the third is some of our clients have moved to monthly programs on OREO versus annualized programs. So that will have \u2013 not an impact on our earned premium but certainly on our written premium. So, all those factors are in play and off the top of my head I just don\u2019t have those relative differences.","Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, thanks. And then lastly, back to the regulatory issue. I think if I characterize, some of your comment that probably Rob and maybe this isn\u2019t clear or it\u2019s oversimplifies and correct me, but I think part of what you are saying is that the regulatory focus is largely on the servicers.","It\u2019s not on the insurers and in fact you are really not facing issues with your insurance regulators. And therefore, perhaps you are not substantially at risk in this process. But I wonder if that kind of oversimplifies because I thought one of the issues that was on the table with the servicers was the idea that perhaps they should be required to make much greater efforts to maintain the original voluntary coverages that we\u2019re in place in order to help kind of manage the cost of the coverage. Is that, it\u2019s your understanding that issue was on the table and if so, I mean, isn\u2019t that\u2019s something that indirectly would impact you?","Rob Pollock","A couple of points. First is, I think your characterization is right for Assurant, I don\u2019t hope to comment on where any other insurers are in the process, because I don\u2019t really know. So I can only comment related to us. Second, I think, we\u2019ve done a lot to try and inform of all the efforts we go through to maintain coverage.","That\u2019s a big part of the service we provide and we provided to our servicers. We start with somewhere during the year like 13% of all mortgage holders we get some notification that there has been insurance may not be remaining in force. And through our efforts, we are able to reduce that down to the 2% range.","I think that\u2019s a great value to the servicers et cetera as part of that process. So number one thing we try and do is, do exactly what you said, keep that voluntary coverage in place. It\u2019s only when none of that happens that returned to placing the policy.","Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I probably didn\u2019t appreciate that as well as I should have. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","We\u2019ll have a follow-up from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","Rob Pollock","Hi Mark.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi, thanks for the follow-up. Maybe just taking you back a little basic, on health.","Rob Pollock","Sure.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Even if I adjust for the rebate in the quarter and knowing that the favorable reserve developments should be much lighter as that\u2019s largely played out. It was still a huge quarter and to a prior question expenses weren\u2019t really kind of the driver. What exactly drove the, that\u2019s certainly is a very large health number relative to my own expectations than I assume others?","Mike Peninger","I think that there was - I\u2019m just trying to think about a number backwards. I mean, I think Health has continued to monitor their experience. They have continued to drive down the expenses. There wasn\u2019t anything dramatic aside from the rebate, the change in the rebate Mark that I\u2019m thinking of.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Yes.","Rob Pollock","I can\u2019t either. Obviously, all the issues that are going on there we\u2019re selling some business. That\u2019s a positive for us that allow us to spread over that broader base of things, but I just think it\u2019s the execution of their strategy coming to fruition, yes.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Are you still waiting on additional states to decide on the transitional provisions? And if so, how big?","Chris Pagano","I think there are a few still outstanding. Most of them have been decided, I think there are a handful of there Mark that were still waiting to hear on. And I think at least\u2026","Rob Pollock","But there is a number that we have also heard are not going to be granted. So the pool has shrunk for those who might be granted relief.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Right. Okay and then actually just one question on Specialty Property as a follow-up. I was trying to kind of square this a little bit. The guidance for 2012 suggested some kind of deterioration in loss ration some deterioration in expense ratio.","But it was largely attributed to product diversification. It wasn\u2019t attributed to reinsurance pricing, kind of rates. But then in Chris\u2019s comments, you talked about reinsurance pricing going up, 10% to 15% and I\u2019m trying to think about, does that suggest that pricing on the core product is going up to meet that reinsurance pricing? Does it mean we are kind of reducing our kind of outlays for reinsurance and therefore kind of maybe the risk is going up a little bit, like how do I kind of square those comments?","Mike Peninger","Yeah, it\u2019s complicated because remember, for instance the reinsurance program we just placed the CAT bonds. We had the CAT bond that was rolling off the market that was in place when that CAT bond was brought to market was a tighter market than we are experiencing today.","So we are going to get some benefit from that. I think that Chris provided some general comments, but it depends on the layers we are operating in where we choose to participate or not participate in the tower and we still have a piece of the program to yet buy where we said our deductible is another important consideration. So I think the best time to look at all that Mark is, when we have the final program in place in June and you\u2019ll be able to see the amount of coverage we bought which is obviously more as we have more exposure in the CAT prone areas.","And I think you\u2019ll be able to have the best sense of what that means overall. Our process is also on the rate is asking for rate increases at the state levels. We try and take that into account. That can be a little bit lag sometimes as well.","Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore Partners","Right. Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll have our last question from John Nadel, Sterne Agee.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thanks. Just a quick follow up and it\u2019s sort of along the same lines as Mark did again. I\u2019m just looking at the outlook commentary and thinking about the Specialty Property and earned premiums being relatively flat year-over-year. It\u2019s just when you break down Specialty Property obviously you got the creditor placed, you get the manufactured housing and you got the other which is that slew of renters and other products.","Can you just give us a sense for, as you look out to 2012, what your general expectations for each of those pieces that get you to flat? Is it still, we are still looking for Specialty Property to shrink or no, I mean for a creditor placed to shrink or no?","Rob Pollock","Maybe, but it just be a small amount. It\u2019s all going to be a function John of the placement rates.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Yeah. And obviously that just had a nice lift with the new loans you\u2019ve brought on right, so?","Rob Pollock","We believe so.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Yeah. So that I mean, that\u2019s probably, I mean, is it fair to assume that had that particular accounts or loan package, that particular loan package did not come on all else equal we\u2019d be looking at a faster rate of decline, correct?","Mike Peninger","Well, if you go back again to our Investor Day presentation, we presented an outlook John, that\u2019s lengthening a bit or going more slowly than we might have put out there. But that trend I think is inevitable. It\u2019s really a question of pacing in the lender place and where we are really seeing the \u2013 expecting the growth is on that multi-family housing business. We\u2019ve got the SureDeposit is added to offering there and that\u2019s where we are really expecting to see growth that will help offset this pace of the decline.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay and then just, I appreciate that, and then just one more quick follow-up on capital or capital levels or whatever. As of the end of the year what do you estimate your incremental debt capacity is right now?","Mike Peninger","Well I think it\u2019s still about, the $350 million we\u2019ve talked about if you look at the debt-to-cap ratio that\u2019s been pretty consistent over the full year. There we are going to be opportunistic. It is another source and another source of financial flexibility for us. But then I think about the interest rate environment and kind of recent commentary from the Fed in terms of what they are going to do and we want to be very careful about adding capacity when there is no imminent need and we do have such strong operating cash flows and a large holding company capital position.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","I can think of an imminent need. Thank you.","Rob Pollock","Thanks, John. Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.","Operator","This concludes Assurant\u2019s fourth quarter 2011 conference call. Please note a replay will be available as of 11:00 AM.
