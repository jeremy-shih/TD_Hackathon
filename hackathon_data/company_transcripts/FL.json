This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views for future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on many assumptions and factors, including the effects of currency, fluctuations customer preference, economic and market conditions worldwide and other risks and uncertainties described in the Company's press releases and SEC filings.","We refer you to Foot Locker, Inc.'s most recently filed form 10-K or form 10-Q for a complete description of these factors. Any changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results and actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. If you have not received today's release, it is available on the internet at www.prnewswire.com or www.footlocker-inc.com. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call to John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John Maurer","Thanks, Emma. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s third quarter earnings conference call. I'm joined this morning by Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who in a moment will provide the details of the Company's strong third quarter financial performance; and by Richard Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will highlight the strength of our position in the athletic industry and discuss some key recent merchandise trends. First, though, let me give a high-level overview of our results.","Driven by a comparable store sales gain of 4.7%, the Company generated earnings of $157 million in the third quarter or $1.17 per share. This strong result includes two significant accounting events, a tax adjustment and an impairment charge which together increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Thus on a non-GAAP basis Foot Locker earnings were $1.13 in the quarter, up 13% from our non-GAAP result of $1 a year ago.","While a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the tables attached to this morning's press release, let me very briefly say that the tax expense adjustment resulted from a scheduled reassessment of the value of the intellectual property provided by Foot Locker in the U.S. to our European business. Driven by the recent strong performance of the Foot Locker business in Europe, the new higher valuation resulted in increased deductions that reduced tax expense by $10 million, adding $0.07 per share to our GAAP earnings.","Going the other direction was an impairment charge primarily related to certain underperforming store assets of Runners Point and Sidestep which overall continued its negative sales trend. This charge was $6 million on a pretax basis or $0.03 per share after tax, resulting in the net $0.04 differential between our GAAP earnings of $1.17 per share and our non-GAAP result of $1.13.","The strong third quarter performance when added to our first-half results brought our year-to-date non-GAAP earnings to $470 million. This equates to EPS of $3.46, 10% over last year's earnings of $3.14 per share on a non-GAAP basis.","With that summary let me pass the call to Lauren.","Lauren Peters","Thank you, John and good morning to you all. We appreciate your interest in Foot Locker and thank you for joining us this morning. As John mentioned, the third quarter marked yet another strong performance for Foot Locker. And it all starts with the top line where we produced a 4.7% comparable store sales gain, in line with our previous guidance of a mid single-digit increase. This strong result was on top of last year's robust 8.7% comp gain.","In terms of cadence our comparable sales increased mid-single digits in each month of the quarter. Looking at the details, we saw that many of the same trends we have spoken about this year remained unchanged during the third quarter. By category, footwear and apparel were both up mid-single digits, while accessories posted a low single-digit decline. Women's footwear was quite strong, posting a double-digit comparable sales gain. Superstar from adi was especially popular with women and led the increase across virtually all of our geographies and banners where we sell women's products. Our children's footwear business also performed well and was up mid-single digits, while our men's footwear sales finished up low single digits.","By category, running and casual footwear were both up in the high single-digit range, while basketball was down slightly. Lifestyle running, led by Nike and adi, continued to be very strong, while among our casual styles of Stan Smith from adi, Vans Classics and Puma Suedes and Clydes were top consumer choices. Within basketball, strength in court classic styles such as superstars, largely offset declines in performance shoes.","Average selling prices in footwear were up in the low end of mid-single digits, while units were also up low single digits. Unlike a lot of retail, our store traffic in the U.S. was up and our comparable sales in the store segment were up mid-single digits.","On a percentage basis, the top performer this quarter was SIX:02, with the comp sales increase well into double digits. This exciting performance was driven by footwear with strong gains in Puma, adi and Nike. Foot Locker Canada continued its strong performance, producing an excellent double-digit increase, driven by strong results in men's, women's and kids. Footwear was up double digits and apparel and accessories were both up high single digits.","Among the male banners in the U.S., the top performance was delivered by Champ Sports which produced a double-digit comparable sales gain, driven by a mid-teens increase in apparel and a high single-digit gain in footwear. The Foot Locker division in the U.S. which now includes our remaining Lady Foot Locker stores, was up mid-single digits. As previously mentioned, we have found that our Lady Foot Locker customer largely responds to the same influences as the female customer in our Foot Locker stores. Kids Foot Locker, meanwhile, was up in the low end of mid-single digits while Foot Action posted a low single-digit gain.","No doubt the most exciting event of the quarter for us was the reopening of our flagship store on 34th street at the end of August. The grand opening generated tremendous excitement amongst the legions of customers that took part in the launch of the newest, most premium sneaker experience in New York. The space includes not just the pinnacle Foot Locker experience but also contains shops to highlight the best product story of all of our fantastic innovative vendors. And for me, most exciting of all, is the first SIX:02 presence here in New York City, a key step that we believe will build brand awareness for the banner, not just in New York but nationally and even, to some extent, internationally.","Elsewhere among our international divisions, Foot Locker Asia Pacific comped up low single digits. Foot Locker Europe was pressured by declines in traffic, especially in Italy, France and Spain and produced a low single-digit comp sales decline. Our women's business in Europe stood out with a strong performance in both footwear and apparel.","We believe that the current negative traffic trends in Europe will dissipate. Our youthful customers tend to be resilient. And we believe the investments we're making to elevate the experience of our European sneaker enthusiasts and build even deeper connections with them will drive future increases in traffic.","Our weakest store banner performances were at our Runners Point and Sidestep banners which continued to face traffic and sales challenges and were down double digits during the quarter. Our direct-to-customer segment turned in a solid overall performance with an 8.9% comp gain. Our collective store banners.com business in the U.S. continued its strong growth with sales up slightly over 20%. While our international direct businesses, including the digital operations of the Foot Locker banner in Europe and Canada, were up approximately 50%.","Eastbay, on the other hand, declined high single digits. Dick will provide some perspective during his remarks about this result and our ongoing efforts to improve the performance at Eastbay. Overall, direct-to-customer sales increased to 12.8% of total sales, up from 12.4% a year ago.","Moving to the rest of the income statement, gross margin improved by 10 basis points to 33.9% of sales. The uptick was driven by merchandise margin which also improved by 10 basis points. The progress in merchandise margin was the result of the lower markdowns in our stores, partially offset by a decrease in the merchandise margin of our direct-to-customer business. As we noted on our previous call, Eastbay which is still our largest digital banner, continued to be more promotional than in the past in response to weakening traffic to its website.","Our team did another very good job managing expenses during the third quarter. Our SG&A expense rate improved by 20 basis points to 19.4% of sales, despite increased marketing costs within the direct-to-customer segment which we mentioned would persist when we provided guidance on last quarter's call.","Depreciation expense increased $40 million, up $2 million compared to last year. Consistent with previous quarters, this increase reflects the incremental investments we're making in our store fleet, our digital businesses and technology to continue to drive greater productivity from all of our assets.","On a GAAP basis our Q3 tax rate came in at 30.9%, the result of the tax benefit in Europe that John mentioned in his opening remarks. On a non-GAAP basis, our tax rate was 34.9%. We expect to realize a modest ongoing tax rate improvement in future periods from the new intellectual property valuation. This benefit will be included in future guidance.","Turning to the balance sheet, we continue to manage our inventory effectively and ended the quarter with inventory up 1.9% from a year ago compared to a sales increase of 5.1%. On a constant currency basis, inventory was up 2.2% compared to our 5.5% sales increase.","Our inventory remains fresh and exciting and we're well-positioned for the important upcoming holiday season starting this weekend with this year's addition of the Week of Greatness. It's going to be great. Just ask Tom Brady.","We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $865 million, down $13 million from a year ago. We continued using our balanced approach to capital allocation, including reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders.","First, capital expenditures in the quarter were $62 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $193 million and leaving us on track to reach the full-year target of approximately $290 million that we mentioned last quarter. Second, we returned $37 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and, finally, we spent $76 million to repurchase 1.15 million shares of common stock. In total we have returned $463 million to our shareholders through the first nine months of the year, while continuing to make the strategic investments in the business necessary to drive our future growth.","Before I turn the call over to Dick, let me reiterate that for the fourth quarter we continue to expect a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain, slight improvements in both gross margin and SG&A and a double-digit EPS. As a result, we're on track to achieve the annual guidance we gave you at the beginning of 2016 - a mid-single-digit comparable sales increase and a double-digit gain in EPS.","Let me now hand the call to Dick to discuss our important leadership role in the industry and highlight a few of the major product trends this quarter.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Lauren. Good morning, all and thanks for joining us. In our last call, I began my remarks by describing the many dimensions of leadership that Foot Locker has in the athletic industry. These dimensions of leadership include our excellent people, our strong brands, our extensive global reach, the diversity of the categories in which we operate and ultimately, our outstanding financial performance.","The very first dimension I discussed is actually the most important one and that is the leadership position we have with the core customers of each of our banners. I want to come back to this aspect because it is a crucial element of our ongoing success story.","In the past, we have talked about the casualization of the dressing styles around the world and the ongoing adoption of healthier, more active lifestyles, both of which support steady growth of our athletic footwear and apparel businesses. But our teams' work with our customers is much more dynamic and powerful than that. It comes down to this; our brands are at the epicenter of sneaker culture and we work hard every day to stay there, because what drives sneaker culture is changing all the time.","What is sneaker culture? It means different things to different people, but the heart of it is a true, deep passion for sneakers. And what defines the epicenter of sneaker culture is a bit different for each of our core customers. The forces driving a love for sneakers with our muse at Champ Sports are not exactly the same as the forces motivating our customers at Foot Action or Foot Locker. And the Foot Locker customer in New York is different than the one in LA or London, Paris, Milan or, for that matter, Sydney or Auckland. Sometimes it's a musician, sometimes it's an athlete and very often that athlete style off the court or pitch is even more influential than what he or she accomplishes in their sport.","Our female customers have an even broader range of style influences and not surprisingly, the muse at Lady Foot Locker is very different than the one at SIX:02. That's one of the key reasons we separated the management of these two businesses. With the ubiquity of social media, there are, of course, some overarching style themes that each of these sneaker lovers share, but it is our own passion for sneakers and our understanding of these subtle differences that are key to our ability to maintain critical points of differentiation between our banners and from the competition, keeping our interaction with our customers authentic.","Authenticity is a key concept in connecting with the customers who are affectionately called sneakerheads, those who buy the most sneakers and who set or influence the athletic footwear and apparel styles for their peers. We strive to be authentic with our customers and the products we showcase in the quality of the physical spaces they shop in and the seamlessness of the digital interaction we get with them and in the knowledge and enthusiasm of our associates as they engage with our customers each and every day.","In terms of physical locations, Lauren mentioned the high energy flagship store on 34th Street that we reopened in August which is off to a great start. If there's an epicenter of sneaker culture in New York, it's got to be on 34th street. This quarter, we will also debut our exciting new combined Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and SIX:02 stores near Times Square. That grand opening is slated for January.","The best thing about sneakerheads is that they come from all over, in all shapes and sizes, ethnicities, genders and ages. In fact, kids are starting earlier and earlier to develop into sneaker aficionados. We actually have four-year-old sneakerhead customers. Sometimes their parents, who also grew up loving sneakers, get them involved and sometimes the kids push the parents, but either way it's been a huge benefit to our leading position in the kids' business.","Although some kids grow out of being sneakerheads as they become teenagers and then adults, fortunately, it turns out a lot of them don't. It's a common occurrence for shareholders to tell me they have a teenage son or daughter who is absolutely passionate about sneakers. And on more than one occasion I've also had the pleasure of talking in depth about our various business strategies with the portfolio manager who, as the meeting was wrapping up, has come up to me privately and said - hey, I get it, I've got 30 pairs of sneakers in the closet myself. I usually tell them that with 30 pairs, they are just getting started.","As great as our vendors are and they are all excellent, style preferences of our customers shift between them which is why being a multi-brand retailer is so important. Our vendors have certainly come to recognize and support the critical position we have built within the industry in terms of providing that feeling of authenticity to our customer. As our tag line says, if it's at Foot Locker it's approved.","We work continuously with our vendors to share the insights we gathered during the journey of discovering what our customers find to be the best, coolest sneakers and apparel at any given moment. Ultimately, it is having available the most innovative products from our outstanding suppliers that keeps our banners top of mind with our most influential customers.","There are always competitors who would like to knock us off our spot at the epicenter of sneaker culture. We never take it for granted that we will remain our customers' preferred destination. And we work hard every day to maintain our unparalleled connection with and understanding of the customers of each of our banners.","We started a few years ago with the male muse for each of our banners and a female muse for our women's business. We have progressed dramatically since then to identify the core male, female and child customers of each of our banners. And for our kids business, we've even started talking about the parent muse.","As I said, it starts with our store associates who often proudly describe themselves as sneakerheads and it extends to our marketing teams, our merchants and, indeed, everyone in our Company. It is vital to our ongoing success of staying at the center of sneaker culture. While Lauren mentioned quite a few banner, geographic, channel and category highlights that illustrate how all of that excellent work is driving our strong overall performance, she also mentioned a couple of softer parts of our business which highlights how difficult it is to build and maintain our central position. The solution to these two areas that I'm about to talk about I firmly believe are rooted in doing an even better job understanding and engaging with the core customers at these banners.","First, Runners Point and Sidestep banners continue to struggle, as seen in the negative comp result and the impairment charge taken this quarter. While part of the challenge is related to German retail in general, I believe the more fundamental issue is that we fired too many customers when we embarked on our banner segmentation strategy in Germany a couple year ago. We made some assumptions about who our core customers were in these two banners and worked with our vendors to deliver product assortments we believed would be right for them.","In retrospect, the team there didn't have the same process and discipline for listening to our customers that we have developed at our other banners. So, we have now redoubled our efforts to make those connections. I can't say yet that we have it solved perfectly going forward. And even to the extent that we have improved our own understanding of what motivates the customers of these banners, we still have the challenge of making sure all of our vendors equally understand and allocate the right product.","For example, while the sharp point of differentiation at Runners Point is on the performance running side, we know this banner's customers wear sneakers for a lot of other occasions in their life and we need to be the destination for those sneaker purchases, as well. We remain committed to the runners Point and Sidestep business and believe we can get their performance back to the previous levels of profitability which is the starting point for the ultimate goal of expanding those banners outside Germany.","Turning to Eastbay, a big factor in that banner's recent struggles continues to be the overall shift in style preferences away from performance-oriented products to more athletic lifestyle assortments. That said, this is an area where we let ourselves get knocked off center a bit in connecting with the elite high school athlete who has always worn both casual athletic and performance footwear and apparel. But we're still strongly positioned with him and her. And we have recently hired a new leader for our digital business, Najay Talwar [ph], who brings a wealth of knowledge, experience and energy to the challenge of again making Eastbay the first choice for that important customer.","Before we get to your questions I'd like to just touch on a few product highlights. First of all, one of the most significant dynamics in our industry right now is the continued growth of adidas across multiple platforms. On the lifestyle side, adi originals, such as Nomad and Superstars, are continuing to be on trend, while the performance styles of Pureboost and Ultraboost are growing in importance in all of our geographies.","Nike certainly remains our largest vendor by far overall and largest in each of our banners. Lifestyle running continued to be a tremendous strength for Nike, with significant sales of Roshe, Huarache, Presto and Max Air cross all our markets. The Jordan brand continues to build popularity around the world. And there was also strength in Foamposites and seasonal boots from Nike.","While signature basketball overall remains soft, Nike's Kyrie Irving shoes sold quite well, as did the Curry 2.0 and 2.5 product from Under Armour. Another strongly uptrending brand in the quarter was Puma. Puma creepers, platforms and suedes delivered excellent performance across almost all of our banners, especially in our women's businesses. While limited to certain banners and geographies, we're also seeing encouraging momentum in other brands such as Vans, Reebok, Asics and New Balance.","Our boot business, led by Timberland, is still quite important although it has gotten off to a somewhat slower start this year compared to last year.","In apparel, I'm very pleased with the mid single-digit sales increase that Lauren mentioned. We're making progress in our apparel businesses in most of our banners. Overall apparel profitability is up, to the point where margins are close to catching up to the already strong footwear margins. ASPs in apparel were up double digits, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on a more premium assortment. Apparel units, as expected, were down.","The windwear category, led by products such as the Nike Windrunner, continues to be the hottest trend right now. Our overall t-shirt business performed very well, propelled by our own team edition group, as did CSG fleece and nylon jackets at Champ Sports.","I'd like to close my remarks by saying how proud I am of the entire team at Foot Locker, Inc. This was our 27th consecutive quarter of meaningful sales in non-GAAP profit growth. And Lauren outlined our belief that we can attain yet another record performance in Q4.","We have diligently executed our strategic initiatives over several years and built a high-performing business, not just from a macro level but also from the ground up. As a business, we strive for consistent, authentic and memorable interactions with each customer who comes into our stores or visits our website. Between our 3,400 stores and our numerous websites, such interactions happen literally millions of times every day. And it is the preparation, skill, the passion of each and every one of our associates that creates the authenticity of these interactions and which motivates our customers to position us at the epicenter of sneaker culture, right where we want to be.","Emma, let's open the call for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robby Ohmes","Dick, I was hoping, there was a lot of commentary you gave us, can you take all of that and put it into how we should think across the banners, what the outlook is from an average selling price versus unit perspective when you take into account all of those different trends across your banners?","Richard Johnson","The interesting piece about the business is that as we mold it all together across all of those banners we continue to see growth in both ASPs and unit prices. I mentioned that unit prices in apparel were up, units were down based on our fewer twofer offers or buy one get one offers. But overall, ASPs and unit prices both wash out to be positive.","Lauren Peters","What we're really experiencing is twofold - that we have been very focused on the inventory and flowing the product well, getting it to the right place, right time. And that has supported more full-price selling. So, part of the ASPs has been less promotion.","But the other piece is that the customer is really resonating, responding to the premium product. This is where they find their cool, so they are opting for that. All of those factors combined are what we're seeing show up in ASP. But our team remains very focused on making sure that we've got a solid offer across the price points so that our customers have good choice.","Operator","We now have Sam Poser from Susquehanna Financial Group.","Sam Poser","As you look at the SIX:02 you decided not to open stores this year. You have 34th Street, you're going to open Times Square within the big Foot Locker store there. How should we think about planned SIX:02 growth into next year?","Richard Johnson","Sam, as we talked about, we intentionally slowed down this year to make sure that we get these two big flagship opportunities on 34th and Times Square right. We've seen a shift in the assortment, we've seen a shift in the engagement with the consumer. So, our anticipation is that we'll open some doors in 2017, likely in the back half. We're still looking for the right deals, the right places, but we anticipate that we'll begin the process in the second half of 2017 and be in a position to ramp it up a bit in 2018.","Sam Poser","Do you expect to have net store openings next year, in general or is that still going to be a net closing situation as far as you see it right now?","Richard Johnson","We've been close this year.","Lauren Peters","It's about a wash this year.","Richard Johnson","We could be a little bit net positive next year, could be a little bit net negative. The plan is to be a few doors bigger. The truth is that we close stores when we come across the right opportunities to close the right doors. And for us, Sam, as you know, it's a productivity story. In a lot of the remodels and partnership stores that we're opening, as we remodel and relocate we take more square footage on. So, even with the door closures we've seen square footage growth be fairly consistent over the past few years and we expect that to continue.","Lauren Peters","We still see door count expansion opportunities, certainly in Europe and with our Kids Foot Locker banner.","Sam Poser","And then, lastly, could you talk about maybe the difference between, let's say, your day-to-day footwear business versus the launch businesses and maybe an idea. Lauren, you talked about the price, the variance of the different price points. So, basically there's shoes that are designed for Saturdays and then there are shoes that are designed for the rest of the week. Could you give us some color on how you think about that, because I think everybody in the investment community tends to get focused on the Saturday shoes.","Richard Johnson","Launch is certainly part of the business, Sam. As you know the business well, launches aren't just Saturday launches anymore, by the way. We launch products throughout the week. ASPs are a combination of the entire week matched together. So, while we like the way the launch calendar lines up in Q4, I also like the flow of, as you put it, Monday through Friday product. We have great innovative product from our vendors.","Not all of it has a don't sell before date or a launch date. A lot of it comes in and we're able to sell it immediately. So, the mixture of great innovative product Monday through Friday with some heat that comes through launches on Saturday makes for a great combination across our banners.","Operator","We now have Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo Lyon","I wanted to get your thoughts on what's going on with the brand shift - and the shifting strength within your category brands, in particular how that's affected your basketball business, excluding superstars, so the performance basketball. How do you think about the brand mix developing and unfolding into next year? Is this going to be a continuation of the trend that we have been seeing? And do you see product down the pipe that can actually start to reverse the trend in basketball to turn it more positive?","Richard Johnson","I think the brand trend I talked about in my prepared comments. We take great pride in being a multi-branded retailer. We have great brand partners across all of our geographies in all of our banners.","Our consumer, while brand is important to the consumer, cool is more important to the consumer. So, they move to where they find the coolest sneaker that appeals to them. That appeal may come from social media, it may come from the group of people they hang out with, it may come from the jean style that they choose to wear.","But we continue to see strength in the key brands that I called out certainly. Adidas is on a great run, they're having a lot of success. But we, at the same time, have tremendous successes across the Nike brand. The one place that you called out, Camilo, signature basketball, is a place that's a little bit softer. With that being said, we saw some good pop on the KD 9 that came out. The Kyrie Irving shoe continues to perform exceptionally well.","The Under Armour Curry product, the 2.0 and 2.5, during the quarter did very well. So, it's a combination and certainly we see product that we believe is going to excite the customer. Some of it's in signature basketball, some of it's in lifestyle running.","I've talked the last couple calls that our team does such a tremendous job of moving open to buy dollars from vendors and categories. We don't really think in terms of categories as much as maybe the analyst community does. We think in terms of what's going to motivate the kid to buy and we create in store and online and digital environments to appeal to that.","So, yes, we see good products coming and some of them are certainly in performance signature basketball, but they're spread across the range of product offerings.","Camilo Lyon","I think your visibility probably takes you through fall of next year. Is that fair to say? Assuming that's the case, do you see any major trend shifts that are noteworthy from a product perspective? Or is this more of a continuation of the increasing amount of inventory that can support the continuation of what's been a very strong lifestyle running casual trend?","Richard Johnson","Again, I think the trend that drives our consumer, Camilo, is whatever is the coolest, most innovative product. You can say - well, a Stan Smith is not overly innovative - but for this generation that is seeing it for the first time, this group of sneaker aficionados that's seeing it for the first time, it was very cool. She really found the Stan Smith and the Superstar as shoes that intrigued her. So, again, not highly innovative but very exciting for that consumer.","Lauren Peters","And they know that they come to us and get the special editions of those classics.","Richard Johnson","I think the shifts that we'll see, Camilo, will be driven by innovation, it will be driven by things with knit uppers, there's mid sole things coming along. We've got great relationships with the vendors and we work with them and give them the insights that we get from our consumers and hopefully that leads to exciting products for the consumers to buy in our stores.","Camilo Lyon","And just a final question for you, Lauren, as you think about the margin contributors, the gross margin contributors, the puts and takes, what opportunities are left for some margin expansion? Is it just really relegated to apparel or are there other opportunities within the business that can be positive catalysts to gross margin expansion? Thanks.","Lauren Peters","We're not done with getting the right product to the right place, the flow initiatives. There's always more there and we certainly have a number of things we're working on. So, that will continue to help full-price selling as we make the experience between bricks and digital ever smoother, that also helps with more full-priced selling. It makes your inventory that much more effective. But, yes, certainly apparel, as we get to our A game in that.","As we said, we did have margin rate improvements on apparel and the chase is back on with apparel chasing footwear. We think one day that apparel margin can be significantly above footwear. So, yes, we remain encouraged by upside to both the gross margin and SG&A. And, of course, on the SG&A side is where pursuing that sales per square foot of $600, that's a powerful productivity driver.","Operator","We now have Mr. Tom Nikic from Wells Fargo Securities.","Tom Nikic","The downturn in southern Europe seems a little surprising. Europe had been one of your strong points in the last couple quarters. Do you have a sense as to what happened in those Markets? And you mentioned you're confident that it will bounce back. What drives that confidence?","Richard Johnson","There is a lot of macro things that happened, certainly in France, beginning with the Bastille Day terror attack and some things that obviously are out of our control. I think it caused people to take a pause, specifically in France. The Italian consumer is a little bit fickle. They shop at exactly the right moments. And while the back-to-school season seemed to be okay, traffic after back-to-school dropped off.","We see the earthquakes that hit in the center part of Italy certainly shake the culture of the country. They were felt a long way. But the thing that I can tell you, Tom, is that, as we see traffic up and down, the European consumer is very resilient.","This young consumer is really obsessed with sneaker culture and they will be back. As we head into the holiday season our team is certainly ready and prepared and the product assortments will draw them back. There's great marketing that going on, the team over in Europe is doing a fantastic job.","Lauren referred to our week of greatness and this year's campaign, I think, is by far the best that we've done, but it also is the most international that we've done. We've got a couple of international versions of it that will certainly drive some traffic over in Europe, featuring a couple of key football players over there. We're confident, the team in Europe is confident, that traffic in the markets that we called out will certainly be back over the holiday season.","Lauren Peters","Our young customer, no matter which geography we're talking about, they define their cool and their styles by their sneakers. So, we remain confident that they are going to come in to see us to get them.","Operator","We now have Jonathan Komp from Robert W. Baird.","Jonathan Komp","Lauren, maybe first question just following up on the merchandise margin. Any chance you can parse out what type of improvement you saw at the store levels? It sounds like the direct-to-consumer has been a bit of a drag for a couple of quarters.","Lauren Peters","We did see improvement in the stores margin and a bit of a further pull back in direct. The Eastbay business we highlighted in particular got a bit more promotional, trying to improve the traffic to the website. So, yes, the 10 basis points that we got was the plan to cross the two with those two dynamics.","Jonathan Komp","Do you have any sense on the direct side how many quarters that might be a head wind yet?","Richard Johnson","We're going to attack it quarter by quarter, Jonathan. The traffic, we believe, will find some drivers that motivate the consumer to come back, deeper connectivity with that customer. I don't have that crystal ball but I know that we're committed to addressing it quarter by quarter and we believe that we will continue to make progress.","Jonathan Komp","And then Dick or Lauren, I'd be curious to hear a little more how you're thinking heading into the holiday. I know you're not giving quarter-to-date comps anymore. The context of my question is, I think comps are up 4% year to date and obviously you held mid-single-digit guidance which implies at least 4% and maybe higher in the fourth quarter. So, I'm curious to hear how you're thinking about the next couple of months.","Richard Johnson","Jonathan, the glass is always half full when you're in our spot. But as I mentioned on an earlier question, we like the way the launch calendar lines up for the fourth quarter. I really like the way that the product flow is set up across our banners. It's that time when the shoppers are out. And the team is certainly energized. When you combine all of those things, some of the investments we've made, both in the physical stores and on the digital side, to make the connectivity a bit better, I'm cautiously optimistic all the time, but just the way the product flow is, I think the customers will respond favorably.","Jonathan Komp","Okay. And last one, if I could just sneak it in there, do you have any sense - I'm curious on your expectations for Under Armour and the Curry platform to sustain momentum against some tougher comparisons coming up? Any thoughts on more of the outlook there?","Richard Johnson","I think Under Armour is doing a great job investing in their footwear business. As I talked about, the 2.0 and 2.5 Curry shoes in third quarter performed well. The 3.0 is fairly new into the business. It started off a bit slower than the two previous models but, again, it's early days. I think their commitment to the footwear business, they've got a great asset in Steph Curry, obviously and they expand their asset base, as well, beyond Curry.","The thing that we all want to see them have is a multi-platform footwear business and Curry is certainly in the lead. We're optimistic that they are going to be able to continue to keep that platform with some momentum behind it and certainly expand their footwear offerings.","Operator","Now we have Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","I wanted to ask, in Europe, maybe if you could dive in a little bit the performance of the Foot Locker banners in Europe. Maybe you can share some of the differences in the performance between the footwear Locker banners and the two Runner Point and Sidestep that aren't working as well. If there's any learnings there or insights you could share, that would be helpful.","Richard Johnson","The biggest difference is that Foot Locker Europe covers 19 countries. So, there's ups and downs across the countries but they've got a much broader base. Runner Point and Sidestep are, for the greatest part, domiciled within the borders of Germany. So, if there's traffic issues in Germany, Runner Point and Sidestep don't have any other place they can be lifted from. The connectivity with the consumer, I think the Foot Locker Europe team has a deep connectivity in understanding and engagement with their consumer base.","That varies country to country, obviously. The north of Europe and the south of Europe have very different buying patterns and buying characteristics and product desires. The Sidestep and Runner Point business have, relatively speaking, no apparel. There's a little bit of performance running apparel in Runner Point stores. Part of the strength of Foot Locker Europe is a really good footwear business, in general and a much improved apparel business over the last six or seven quarters. Probably the biggest thing is that Runner Point and Sidestep don't have the ability to diversify from a geography point of view or a family of business point of view.","So, the weight is all on sneakers. In Runner Point it's all on running silhouettes of sneakers and Sidestep has got no apparel mix at all. So, those would probably be the biggest differences, Omar.","Omar Saad","And I also wanted to ask about the Nike HyperAdapt. There's been some noise in the press. I think it's launching for holiday. I don't know the allocation you're getting. The price point is going to be really high. If you have any comments there, it would be helpful.","Richard Johnson","Well, it's back to the future for all of us, right? Again, it's where Nike can continue to lead innovation. They've got very limited pairs in the marketplace that they are launching in their retail. The question that I think is the most important one around the HyperAdapt is how does that become a commercializable, in a meaningful way, technology. What do they learn from the HyperAdapt that they can take into the broader line. I know that they look at things from an innovation point of view, always seasons ahead. I applaud them for the HyperAdapt. We all wanted it when Marty McFly had it on and now we will get a chance to get it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","On the women's front, can you just talk about your learnings, changes you made to the assortments and how best to think about the global potential SIX:02 store opportunity longer term?","Richard Johnson","I'll back down from global to tell you that we've got to get it right in the U.S. first before we think about it as a global platform. I think what we learned, probably the biggest learning, we started out very much performance-led, with fashion being the second feature of the assortment, certainly from an apparel point of view. The big shift that's happened, Matt, is that we now look from a lifestyle\/fashion perspective first and know that the function of the performance aspects have to be built into a lot of the assortment because she wants to look great but she expects it to perform.","Some of the Rihanna product that we launched with Puma, right as we opened the store in late August, beginning of September, people look at it and say - well, that's very fashion forward for a Foot Locker banner. And they're right, it is. But that's the attraction that our muse in that banner, in the SIX:02 banner has.","The shift has been from performance-led to lifestyle-led with performance attributes. That's both on - mostly on an apparel point of view but also on a footwear point of view. Some of the creepers and things that we mentioned in our prepared remarks obviously resonated really well with the SIX:02 consumer.","The energy that we see in the SIX:02 store on 34th Street here is helping us understand what that in-store experience for the consumer should be like. And we'll be able to take those learnings and take it across the other 30 stores in the fleet and, as I mentioned earlier, be ready to expand a bit in the U.S. later in 2017. Once we get it right there then we can come back to your question about a global impact, Matt.","Matthew Boss","And then just a follow-up, as we look at your balance sheet, I think roughly 60% of your cash is overseas. How are you thinking about capital structure opportunity and deployment opportunities in terms of priority going forward?","Lauren Peters","Our number one priority remains investing in our business. As we have described what we're doing on a CapEx front, it looks like we're going to be about $290 million this year as we're investing in making the store experiences terrific and also on the direct side making sure that the websites are equally a good experience for our customer.","And then as we look at these long term objectives and be top-line growth, there are infrastructure needs in order to be able to support all of that. So, that is the third element of the CapEx. We do look for that to continue to be elevated go forward but we have a very balanced approach to capital structure and have been consistent and meaningful returns of cash to the shareholders.","So, that is a very important priority to us. Our Board looks with us at what we're doing with the dividend and share repurchase on a quarterly basis to make sure that we're competitive there and making the right decisions with those capital dollars. So, there are a lot of dynamics and one of them, you rightly point out, is where the cash is located.","But, as we've described, we really do feel very good about the opportunities in Europe outside the U.S. to further our business and that would be part of the use of that capital. So, we think our approach is balanced and we've got the flexibility to execute it.","Operator","We now have a question from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Just a couple modeling questions for you, Lauren. First of all, the buying and occupancy, I think, if I'm right on your metrics, you gave on the gross that the buying and occupancy was flat in the quarter and almost a 5% comp. Is that the leverage point we should think about going forward into the fourth quarter?","Lauren Peters","We think about the leverage point as being at the low end of mid-single. The dynamic that we had this year, we had some significant properties, big properties where we were paying rent without sales, a couple here in New York. So, that created some headwinds on leveraging that occupancy. But as those projects get completed, we begin to get back to a place where we would get leverage.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then a similar model question, you started the year, I think, referring to 2016 as a peak investment year. Can I assume that that's still the right way to think about this as we look out over some longer-range planning for you guys?","Lauren Peters","Yes, when we get to next year we'll give you further color around CapEx, but at this point we have described the next couple of years as being still elevated at about $250 million. But we will give you more insight into that in February.","Michael Binetti","Okay. You're several years into the remodel program at this point and you're probably getting out to pretty solidly renovating the middle tier of your stores at this point. Are the earlier remodels still trending above the corporate average? And how do you think about the eventuality that at some point you'll have to go back to those stores with the next big thing over the next few years?","Richard Johnson","One of the things we've learned through this process is that you have to keep the environments exciting and the customer has to feel comfortable and energized when they walk into the stores. So, yes, we're making progress in the remodels. But we've got a 3,400-door fleet in multiple geographies across multiple banners and across multiple formats.","We continue to plan on investing in the remodels. Our team is always looking for the next thing. We know that we'll be back to update or change as we move forward.","But even the later renditions of our Willowbrooks or GSPs at Footaction or our Tyrones at Champs, they've got slight modifications to them, things that we've learned from the early remodels that we've been able to improve on in the later remodels. So, we're going to continue the program.","We're in the mid-30s, I think, right now or that's what the forecast is for the end of the year - mid to high 40s of the fleet having been touched. We want to change the remodel program when we hit the last store that passes the hurdles. I don't know exactly where that's going to be, but the store fleet being refreshed is really important to our success.","John Maurer","And a lot of those remodels are done based on lease expirations. And they weren't all the top stores first and now we're getting down. We did a little bit of more of the top stores but it's a mix. We still have some good stores, big stores to remodel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz from B. Riley & Company.","Mitch Kummetz","Thanks for taking my questions. Dick, could you talk a little bit about allocations? I guess you would say you always wish you had more of the best-selling stuff. But just anecdotally, it seems like, whenever I go into my local Foot Locker store you guys are a little short on Ultra Boost and NMDs. I'm wondering if there's been a catch-up taking place there, just given the resurgence of adidas particularly around some of those styles and moving forward if you might be in a better position in terms of allocations with some of that hottest product.","Richard Johnson","Mitch, my suggestion would be that you pay close attention to the launch calendar so that you know the day that they are going to be launched so you can get there. The thing that fuels our business with our consumers is a scarcity model. So, while we always wish that we had a little bit more of the best product, the likelihood of us ever being able to satisfy the last customer, we certainly don't want that to happen, frankly.","It takes the excitement away if everybody can get exactly what they want. We want to keep your appetite high for that type of product, Mitch. We work close with the vendors on allocations and distribution. Certainly we try to get more, we try to get what we think is the appropriate amount for our stores. But it's an ongoing conversation. And as significant partners with our suppliers, I think we end up with - I don't know if our fair share is the right way to put it but we end up with a model that the consumers are driven by because they know they have to get into the stores and get it or they might not have the chance. So, the scarcity piece of the allocation model is important to our success, as well.","Lauren Peters","We like our position with this consumer who leads fashion, right? So, it's important to our vendors to win with that customer because they are the ones who are defining cool. So, that's helpful to us.","Mitch Kummetz","Okay. And then, speaking of the launch calendar, obviously you've got the Week of Greatness coming up. And I see that on the 23rd you've got the new Harden shoe. Adidas hasn't been that successful in basketball of late. And, obviously, Dick, in your comments you talked about them showing progress across categories. It seems like basketball is the one where they haven't seen it yet. I'm just wondering how optimistic you are that, that third leg of the stool might be able to turn on for them with this particular shoe and some of the other stuff that they are doing around basketball.","Richard Johnson","I think it's certainly a start. You know they've got a great asset in James Harden, a character, a great athlete, a great player and a style leader. The shoe is interesting, of course. It's got boost in it.","And they've got some new design talent that they are trying to leverage. I'm optimistic that they are going to get basketball right and I think it does start with the Harden shoe. I appreciate the question, Mitch, because it will certainly strengthen their product stool when they get a winning combination with performance basketball.","Operator","The next question will come from Christopher Svezia from Wedbush Securities.","Christopher Svezia","First, on the international side, for Foot Locker Europe, I'm curious, Dick, Sidestep, Runner Point, I think third quarter last year it also was negative, I vaguely remember. I was curious, what's the time frame on turning this around, number one.","And, number two, for Foot Locker Europe you talked about initiatives, marketing, to improve the traffic there. Is it fair to say that potentially Foot Locker Europe turns flattish to maybe positive comp trend for the fourth quarter? That's my first question.","Richard Johnson","We don't get into banner comps by quarter on the call, Chris. But, again, I mentioned the marketing work that's going on. I mentioned some of the outside macro events that you can't guarantee aren't going to recur. The team there is excited about their product flow, excited about some new stores, excited about great products that are going to be in their doors and on their shelves. So, from a Foot Locker Europe perspective, I'm optimistic.","And how long is it going to take in Runners Point and Sidestep, as I said in my prepared comments, I don't think it's necessarily going to come back suddenly. But I think that the work that's going on is identifying the connectivity with the consumer that we may have just made assumptions around and didn't really have as much fact-based information as we do in some of the other banners.","The team in Recklinghausen is focused on that connectivity with the consumer. They are focused on engaging with the vendors to make sure that we've got the right product assortment for both the customers that we have today and the customers that we aspire to get over time.","Christopher Svezia","Okay, thank you. Lauren, for you, on tax rate, you referenced that potentially it could be lower going forward. Any assumptions about a tax rate we should use going forward? Should we just take third quarter and that's the trend line? Any thoughts around that?","Lauren Peters","If you're asking Q4 tax rate, we won't get into next year's tax rate until next year. But in a Q4 you're guided at about 36%, you'd be in the neighborhood.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. And then the last question, you've talked about other brands and how there seems to be a more broad-based brand performance going on. How do you think Foot Locker benefits in that environment where you have more consistent success across multiple brands, maybe not every category but most categories? Is it good to be in that situation versus just having one brand really more dominating the overall category performance?","Richard Johnson","The consumer doesn't think about categories, Chris. They really don't. Unless they happen to be a basketball player or happen to need a pair of football shoes or whatever it happens to be. So, to think that one brand will get it right 100% of the time, as good as our brands are, I don't think that that's going to happen.","The consumer always wants choice. And our consumer is motivated by cool, by sneaker culture. They are not motivated, it's not a basketball culture, it's sneaker culture that drives us.","Sneaker culture crosses all of the brands and all of the categories. I mentioned some of the brands that we're seeing specific geographic success with. They have a window of opportunity.","It may be along the I-95 corridor, it may be a California-based thing. But we have a lot of store density in those two areas. So, some of these brands that I mentioned - Asics, Vans - they've got huge opportunities in a segment of our stores.","The consumer really - we like to say the consumer votes with their feet at the end of the day. They go out and they find what the coolest shoe is. We've always been a multi-branded store.","And I think the work on 34th Street to really showcase those brands, the work in all of our remodels to showcase brands, brings the brand strength together and allows us to tell powerful stories around the great products that our manufacturing partners deliver to us. So, the multi-branded strategy, the strength of those brands, is, again, an important part of our success.","John Maurer","Thank you, everyone, for the excellent questions today. If we didn't get to you or you have a follow-up I'll be back at my desk shortly. Please join us on our next earnings call which we anticipate will take place at 9.00 AM on Friday, February 24 following the release of our fourth quarter and full-year results earlier that morning.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","This conference may contain forward-looking statements that reflect management\u2019s current views of future events and financial performance. Management undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which are based on many assumptions and factors, including the effects of currency fluctuations, customer performances, economic and market conditions worldwide, and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in the Company\u2019s press releases and in reports filed with the SEC, including the most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.","Any changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results, and actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jim Lance, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Mr. Lance, you may begin.","Jim Lance","Thank you, Kim. Welcome everyone to Foot Locker, Inc.\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call.","As reported in this morning\u2019s press release, the Company reported net income of $88 million in the second quarter compared to $51 million in the second quarter of last year. On a GAAP basis, this year\u2019s net income was $0.75 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Included in these results is an incremental pretax charge of $3 million related to the pension litigation matter we have previously disclosed, offset by $2 million of tax benefits related to the tax reform toll charge and other changes in regulations as detailed in the press release. Included in last year\u2019s earnings per share is a $50 million charge related to the same pension litigation. Excluding these items, on a non-GAAP basis, second quarter earnings were $0.75 per share, a 21% increase versus last year\u2019s $0.62 per share.","Unless otherwise noted, the figures and rates mentioned during our call today will be based on non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in this morning\u2019s press release.","We will begin our prepared remarks with Lauren Peters, Foot Locker\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide details on our second quarter financial results along with our financial outlook for the balance of the year. Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who then will review the key drivers of our second quarter performance along with an update on our 2018 real estate and ongoing initiatives. Lauren?","Lauren Peters","Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone.","Reported earlier this morning that we generated 0.5% comparable sales in the second quarter, which is within the guidance we provided the last time we spoke. We are encouraged by this positive inflection in comp sales, expansion in our gross margin rate and an improving assortment of fresh and exciting products. Given that, it all starts with the top-line. So, let\u2019s drill down there.","By month, comp sales in May increased low single digits. June was down low single digits, and July picked back up to post a low single digit gain. Our total reported sales increased 4.8%. The percent difference between our comp gain and the total sales increase was primarily due to the 53rd week sales shift impact. Additionally, the effects from foreign exchange rates increased sales by $15 million.","Within our families of business, footwear posted a slight comp decline with average selling prices up, while units were down. Apparel had another strong performance, up double digits, its eighth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales. Both ASPs and units were up in apparel, reflecting our customers\u2019 strong appetite for our more premium, branded assortment. Lastly, accessories were down double digits, as strong demand for bags was offset by sales declines in hats and socks.","Digging into footwear. Men\u2019s produced a low single-digit comp gain, reflecting the improving breadth and depth in our product assortment, while women\u2019s and kids both posted low single digit comp declines.","Turning to the banners. We had some strong performances in our North American businesses. The positive results were led by East Bay, which generated a high single-digit comp gain. The next strongest banner was Champ Sports, with an increase at the high end of mid single digits. Kids Foot Locker was up low single digits and both Foot Locker U.S. and Foot Locker Canada had slight gains. Yet store banners posted comparable sales decline. Foot Action, which has a high penetration of Jordan and signature basketball, was down mid single digits, while our SIX:02 women\u2019s banner was also down mid single-digits. Our international divisions continued to work through some challenges during the quarter. Foot Locker Europe and Foot Locker Asia Pacific were each down low single digits. Sidestep was down mid single digits, while Runners Point comp down double digits.","In Europe, the market remains promotional overall, with some markets, such as Germany, impacted more than others, which contributed to the softer top-line results at Runners Point and Sidestep. In a few minutes, Dick will provide further color around the products that drove these results.","By channel, comparable sales at our stores posted a 0.8% decline, while comp sales at our direct-to-customer channel were up 9.3%. As a percent of total sales, DTC was 13.5% for the quarter, up from 12.7% last year. Overall, store traffic was down low single digits for the quarter, with traffic at our U.S. banners essentially flat and down high single digits at our international banners.","Moving on to the rest of the income statement. Our gross margin came in at 30.2% in the second quarter, up 60 basis points versus 29.6% last year. The increase in the rate reflects a 30 basis-point improvement in our merchandise margin rate and 30 basis points of leverage in our occupancy and buyers\u2019 compensation. The higher merchandise margin rate was primarily the result of lower markdowns at our U.S. banners, which more than offset the ongoing promotional environment in our international markets and led to a better margin results than our guidance.","Our SG&A expense rate came in at 21.3% in the quarter, up 140 basis points as a percent of sales compared to 19.9% in the prior year. The higher SG&A expense reflects the ongoing investments we are making in our digital capabilities as well as higher incentive compensation expense. As we described in our prior call, in Q2 of last year, we reduced our bonus accruals to be in line with our outlook for 2017. For 2018, SG&A expense includes a more normalized bonus accrual. In addition, we had a legal charge, which contributed 10 basis points of the deleverage.","Depreciation expense was $44 million in the quarter, up $2 million from last year, as a result of our ongoing investments to elevate our customer experience, while interest income was $1 million, flat to last year.","On a GAAP basis, the tax rate came in at 23.6%; this was 730 basis points lower than the prior year, due to the impact of the 21% federal income tax rate as well as the benefit from concluding a foreign tax audit. On a non-GAAP basis, the rate came in at 25.1%, higher than the GAAP rate due to several tax adjustments detailed in the non-GAAP reconciliation.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $950 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $93 million from the end of Q2 last year. We spent $54 million on capital expenditures during the quarter and are on track to spend the annual plan of $230 million. We returned $133 million to shareholders during the quarter. This included our $0.345 which we increased by 11% at the beginning of this year along with the repurchase of about 1.8 million shares for $92.5 million. In total, we have returned $286 million of cash to shareholders this year through our dividend and the buyback of close to 4.5 million shares.","Looking at real estate. We ended the second quarter with 3,276 Company-owned stores, a decrease of 8 stores from the end of the first quarter. During Q2, we opened 13 new stores including the new Power Stores in London and Liverpool. In addition, we remodeled or relocated 33 stores and closed 21 stores. For the full year, we are on track to open 45 new doors including our expansion into Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. We still expect to close approximately 120 stores.","Before I turn the call over to Dick, I want to touch on a few more topics including inventory and the outlook for the remainder of the year. We had solid inventory management during the quarter, with inventory down 2.8% from a year ago, compared to a sales increase of 4.8%.","On a cost and currency basis, inventory decreased 2.4% compared to a 3.9% total sales increase. This disciplined approach combined with an improving flow of products, is making our inventory more productive overall. And we feel that we\u2019re well-positioned to drive stronger results in the back half of 2018. That starts with Q3 and the important back-to-school period.","For the remainder of the year, we are encouraged about the improving top-line trends. For the third quarter, we still expect comparable sales to be up low single digits with Q4 strengthening further within that low single digit range. For gross margin, we anticipate Q3 to be up 10 to 40 basis points. Merchandise margin gains coming from the stronger product assortments, partially offset by deleverage on our occupancy expense, due to the impact of the 53rd week shift. As you may recall, about $60 million of sales, move out of Q3 due to the shift.","SG&A expense is likely to increase by 140 to 160 basis points as a percent of sales. This increase is primarily due to the digital capability investments that we are making, along with wage pressures, the normalized incentive compensation as well as the 53rd week shift.","Also as a reminder, in the third quarter of last year, SG&A expense included $7 million of hurricane related charges. Given all of that, for the full year, we still expect comparable sales to be up low single digits and EPS growth in the double-digit range over the 52-week non-GAAP EPS of $3.99 in 2017. Also on a 52-week basis, we still expect gross margin to improve by 10 to 30 basis points, while we now expect SG&A to increase 100 to 110 basis points, as a percent of sale.","I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Dick, to cover the product highlights in more depth, along with an update on our 2018 real estate and digital initiatives. Dick?","Dick Johnson","Thank you, Lauren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","Overall, the second quarter was in line with our expectations, as we posted a positive comp gain, and grew earnings per share by 21%. This performance reflects the work we are doing on several fronts, so that we are well-positioned to succeed in a rapidly evolving environment. Our customers are moving fast. Our industry is adapting to get closer and faster to market, and we are changing our business, to not only keep up with the change, but to come out ahead of it.","Let me start by focusing on three areas that are all meant to bring us even closer to our customer. The first area is product. We have improved the breadth and depth of many of the top trending footwear styles across categories. We have also upgraded our apparel offerings and we are continuing to see very encouraging results from these efforts.","The second area of focus is around our real estate strategy. We are introducing Power Stores in key markets to create more immersive and community-oriented customer experiences. At the same time, we are entering new markets that we believe have strong growth potential, while expanding our global footprint. We continue to be selective about store locations to ensure we are only pursuing our highest potential opportunities. And third, we are strengthening our digital platforms across our businesses, creating a better customer experience to drive improved customer engagement, while repositioning our loyalty program away from a transactional coupon-based plan to an experiential one, oriented around strategic brand moments. In short, we have a robust operating game plan and our results this quarter demonstrate solid progress.","With that overview, let\u2019s take a look at our second quarter product performance. Men\u2019s footwear was up low single digits. This was driven by up-trending running platforms, along with an uptick in casual styles. And while basketball was down, there were some bright spots. Men\u2019s running drove a mid single digit comp increase. The momentum carried over from the first quarter in key styles from Nike like the Air Max 270, Max 97s and Tuned Air as well Deerupt, Explorer, and Yeezy from adidas. We anticipate that the momentum for these on-trend offerings will carry through the important back-to-school and holiday selling periods. Overall, casual footwear was up strong double digits, fueled by must have classic styles from Vans and Fila. Slides also performed very well and have become a part of our customers\u2019 go-to summer look.","Men\u2019s basketball was down high single digits. As I noted on our last call, the Jordan brand has strategically been pulling back at units in the marketplace. So, while we continue to see better full price sell-throughs, we still face top-line headwinds which we expect to abate over the course of the fourth quarter.","Signature basketball was down double digits due to the ongoing softness across various platforms. However, LeBron was a clear bright spot with strong demand for the LeBron Low, Soldier and Game shoe.","Our apparel business continued to perform well, due to the steps we have taken to focus on elevated brand assortments and stories. This momentum was evident across most geographies, channels and size ranges. These results continued to be led by branded assortments from Nike and adidas as well as on-trend offerings from Champion and Fila.","In terms of our omni comp performance, Champs Sports was up mid single digits, fueled by strong growth in Max Air across multiple styles like Tuned Air, Max 270s and 97s as well as Air Force 1s and LeBron. From Adidas, Yeezy and Swift also provided solid gains. Champs saw robust sales from the Fila brand, specifically in women\u2019s footwear. Apparel had a strong double digit increase, driven by sales of premium branded assortments including fleece and windwear from Nike, Jordan, adidas and Champion.","NBA apparel from Nike posted another strong quarter across multiple teams, and we see continued opportunity with the new uniforms and recent player movement. Our Kids Foot Locker banner, delivered a low single-digit comp gain. This was driven by strong double-digit gains in apparel, partially offset by a low single digit decline in footwear. Apparel was led by Nike and Champion, as we saw strong sale-throughs in fleece, shorts, windwear and infant sets.","In footwear, Nike Air Max was a big hit with our kids, as Tuned Air, and Max 270s led the way. Vans, LeBron, and Slides were also big winners. Similar to the men\u2019s business, the pullback in Jordan units, presented improved sell-through with top-line headwinds.","Turning to Foot Locker U.S. comp sales were up slightly. Foot Locker benefited from strong double-digit comp gains in apparel and mid single digit growth in women\u2019s footwear. Apparel was led by Nike, Jordan and Champion with strong sell-throughs in tees, shorts, fleece and windwear, while women\u2019s footwear growth was driven by Nike Air Max, and Vans.","Men\u2019s footwear was down low single digits, while kids\u2019 footwear was flat. Nike Air Max fueled impressive gains in running. Additionally, Nike Air Force 1s, Vans, Yeezy and Slides also contributed growth in a meaningful way. Conversely, Foot Locker was impacted by difficult Jordan Retro comparisons, along with a down trending signature basketball category, with LeBron, being the notable exception.","As we look at Foot Locker Europe, sales were down low single digits with footwear and apparel both posting comp declines in that range. While still down, this result was an improvement from the declines we experienced over the past several quarters. In footwear, the Nike Air Max platforms resonated with our consumers. Similar to the U.S. Nike Air Force 1s and the Fila Disruptor, also produced solid increases. From adidas, Deerupt, Yeezy, and Continental 80 led the way.","The results also reflect the plans we laid out during the last earnings call to use the legislated promotional periods in the second quarter to clear slower moving styles from adidas and Puma. While we still have more work to do, we anticipate that Foot Locker Europe will progress in the back half of the year, driven by the excellent flow of newness from Nike in both Innovation and Classics. We will also celebrate the 20th anniversary of Tuned Air throughout the fall, with cutting edge executions and consumer activations throughout Europe.","We also see the adidas business in Europe stabilizing somewhat through the Classics business and the new pipeline of offerings. Additionally, we\u2019re building key positions in other brands, including Fila, UGGs, Vans, Champion and others.","Lastly, I want to update you on our East Bay business, which was up high single digits for the quarter. This strong result was led by many of the same footwear and apparel styles we just mentioned, as well as gains in performance styles, including training, baseball, volleyball, and Soccer, along with football cleats from Nike and adidas.","Our team sales business gained traction, powered by our digitally led model, which is providing our school partners and their athletes with greater access to the best performance footwear and apparel.","We are committed and focused as ever on connecting with our customers in cool, elevated ways. This includes exciting fresh product from our existing powerful vendor base and an ever-evolving brand portfolio and unique in-store experiences, like gaming activation events. We are doing all of this in a manner that is meant to be both convenient and tailored to our customer shopping preference whether in-store or through one of our newly enhanced digital sites.","As is likely no surprise to you, our customer is always on with their digital device, and it is our mission to make sure that we remain relevant and top of mind with them 24\/7. Suffice it to say, we remain bullish on our customer connected journey as we progress through 2018 and beyond. As I mentioned at the outset, another important way we continue to elevate the customer experience is through our store design elements, like the two Power Stores that recently opened in Europe. In fact, Lauren and I just visited these stores, and it was readily apparent that they were designed to inspire youth culture and connect to and celebrate their local communities. For example, at our Liverpool store, we commissioned a local artist to create a piece of art work, which is now showcased at the front of the store. We also leveraged this art work to create special product like bags and tees which resonated with our customers.","The other Power Store is located on London\u2019s iconic Oxford Street. Here, customers were able to showcase their gaming skills through an Xbox experience zone, some while queuing up for a loops haircut or a sneaker cleaning. In short, these are just a few examples of the test that we are conducting to create a more immersive customer experience.","Lastly, from a real estate perspective, I\u2019m proud to announce that we will be opening our first store next week in Singapore, Century Square Mall along with the launch of our online channel in that market. This is an important first step as we expand our global reach. During the third quarter, our first Power Store slated to open in Kowloon, Hong Kong along with two more stores in Singapore. We will round out the year with the opening of our first location in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia during the fourth quarter.","We\u2019ve been hard at work on our digital capabilities and have made some notable progress during the second quarter. To start with, the first of our mini hub distribution center test is now live, and we expect to have the second test operational by the end of August. These two mini hubs will be servicing both stores and DTC orders, allowing for quicker store replenishment and next day service to over 6,000 ZIP codes in the U.S. We are excited about the potential to improve the overall customer experience.","Looking at the ongoing upgrade efforts on our digital platforms. During the quarter, we completed further upgrades of our digital sites to our new, more responsive platform. As we move through 2018, we will continue to roll out the upgrade across all our banners with greater functionality, added over time. One example of this includes a more streamlined, My Account and VIP section that will allow for a much more straightforward signup process to our loyalty program and more personalization for our customers. ","Speaking of loyalty, we have mentioned how important experiences in the connections to those key authentic moments have become to our customer. In response, we are working to reshape our loyalty program around strategic brand moments. This is an opportunity to unify the banners on one platform, providing us with more opportunities to leverage data and create a more personalized and relevant program for our members. In turn, members will get credit for their purchases, no matter which banner or channel they choose to shop at.","We are looking forward to bringing this new program to life and expect to have our first pilot up and running in early 2019. Our customers are willing to share their pertinent data with us, as long as we are transparent and use it to create more relevant experiences for them. Having said that, we are proceeding carefully to ensure that the program is in full compliance with the various privacy laws and regulations across the U.S. and abroad.","In terms of the outlook for the balance of the year, we remain optimistic that the improving product flow and depth in premium styles will help us deliver against our comp guidance. Not only do we anticipate more innovative product from our vendor partners, we will also introduce unique footwear and apparel exclusives and collaborations with multiple brands throughout the back half. For example, this week, we announced the Discover Your Air campaign with Nike, featuring Jayson Tatum in exclusive Nike Air sneakers. This campaign will service the creative platform for all Nike Air product and related content at Foot Locker. We believe these types of introductions will further enhance our leadership position in the marketplace.","In closing, none of this would be possible without our associates\u2019 energy, passion and ongoing contributions to the business. I want to express my thanks to each and every one of them as we continue on our journey to inspire and empower use culture and drive the long-term success of our business.","Jim, you can now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Matt McClintock from Barclays has a question. Go ahead.","Matt McClintock","Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. Dick and Lauren, the guidance is for low single digit comps in the back half with an acceleration in that range. I\u2019m just trying to think as we get into 2019, what could get us out of the low single digit range, maybe a little higher? Is it going to take basketball coming back or maybe comparing against some of the malaise that we\u2019ve seen in basketball this year to really to start to get the comp to accelerate or is this kind of longer term the range that we should be thinking about? Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Thanks for the question, Matt. It\u2019s really a combination of many things. Our merchant team is doing great work with our vendor partners to create exciting stories and compelling product and that really drives the heat and the interest. Certainly getting basketball silhouettes included in that product assortment is critical for us, making certain that the running silhouettes continue to drive strength and the casual items as well. So, I think it\u2019s many, many things. We\u2019ve had a strong apparel business now for eight quarters that certainly helps our comp business, and a broad assortment of silhouettes across the footwear side of the business, men\u2019s, women\u2019s and kids. We really need to heat on many cylinders. And while we\u2019ve got a lot of strength going, some acceleration across that range will certainly drive higher comps.","Matt McClintock","Okay. Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up. The SIX:02, could you maybe dive into that a little bit more, in more detail, I mean, with apparel gain as strong as it was this quarter, overall I\u2019m just trying to parse where some of the decline at SIX:02 came from?","Dick Johnson","Well, SIX:02, Matt, had a good quarter in apparel, but was up against some really strong FENTY product and FENTY launches from last year. And the model in SIX:02 is a little bit different and that it\u2019s not driven as much by launch product heat on Saturdays et cetera. So, when we had it a year ago and didn\u2019t have it this year, created a pretty big gap. And Carol and the team did a great job, to reassort the product and push against those launches, but they were just so prolific last year that we really didn\u2019t have the ammunition this year to up against them.","Operator","Janine Stichter from Jefferies is on the line with the question.","Janine Stichter","Hi. Yes. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a bit about the Jordan business. I know, we have seen that business under some pressure just due to the pullback in units in the market. Can you give us some perspective on the timeline? How we should think about that headwind abating and when we start to lap the changes in distribution strategy? Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Can you just repeat the end of that? You started to fade out a little bit.","Janine Stichter","Yes, sure. Just when we start to lap the changes in the distribution strategy and when we kind of get on apples to apples basis when we\u2019re lapping the changes that made the pullback on units in the market? Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Yes. I mentioned that, Janine, in my prepared remarks. We start to see some of that overlap start to occur, when we get to fourth quarter. The sell-through on launch day continues to improve. We don\u2019t have the tail, because the units have been pulled back, but we really expect that to start to abate in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Eric Tracy from Buckingham Research is on the line with the question.","Eric Tracy","Hey, everyone. Good morning. I guess, if I could just go to -- as we think about the comps accelerating in the back half, maybe just the assumptions embedded within that from a product perspective. And where I am going is, is there a assumption that you are getting deeper within some of the existing platforms that have already been launched or scaling with those, or is there visibility to new platforms coming? And then, obviously, just within that, sort of the assumption around basketball in total, you mentioned Jordan and how that abates to just basketball overall? Thanks.","Dick Johnson","Well, our merchant team, as I mentioned, has been hard at work to create some exciting things, and some of those will be certainly on platforms that exist already, some of them will be with new vendor partners, some of them will be on new platforms. So, it\u2019s a combination of many things. And certainly, as we start to see some strength return or some -- I shouldn\u2019t say strength return, we expect to abate against some of the Jordan numbers that will certainly help the comp in the back half.","Basketball, again, it has to be seen as cool by our consumer. And I think some of the same things that are driving the NBA apparel with the player movement and some of the excitements that there will be around the lead when it starts back up this fall, I think it will certainly help the basketball business. But, I\u2019ve said at many times, our kid, Eric, is not focused as much on categories as they are on cool. And the fact that they\u2019re finding cool in a lot of different places right now, whether it be categories or different brands. They\u2019ve got a broad range of interests. So, I think that bodes really well for the work that we\u2019re doing with our vendor partners for the fall and holiday seasons.","Eric Tracy","And then, if I could just follow up on some of the exclusive campaigns you talked about with Nike around Air. But clearly, there is a lot of concern out there just in terms of the brand DTC evolving. So, maybe just speak to, Dick, if you could, things like those type of campaigns, and if there are other examples? And particularly, as it relates to sort of the launch schedule that you all continue to garner some level of exclusivity that\u2019s driving either traffic to the store and\/or your digital platforms.","Dick Johnson","Well, we\u2019ve had a number in the second quarter. We launched East meets West with ASICS, we\u2019ve got the Find Your Air campaign that we\u2019ve just talked about. I\u2019m not going to get into the future ones. That\u2019s part of the discovery that our customer has. The last thing I would do to our merchant and marketing team is bring some of those launch dates with this group when they want to drive the excitement to our core consumers, so. But there is an awful lot of work going on. I can\u2019t reiterate that strong enough that working with many vendor partners to create exclusive platforms to create heat and energy around the product. And you\u2019re right. The vendor DTC is going to continue to grow, but it\u2019s about having an integrated marketplace. Those are all the conversations we have with our vendors. And we\u2019ve got deep, deep connections with our core consumers. And our consumers truly enjoy being in the stores. We\u2019ve talked about traffic being essentially flat in the U.S., down a little bit in Europe. But that consumer is still being driven to the store. They interact -- all of them interact with their digital device, but they like the store environment. And our merchant and marketing teams are doing a great job driving heat to both our digital sites and our physical sites.","Lauren Peters","Our suppliers recognize that connection to our customer and our customer wants to engage with the product physically and compare it across brands. And so, they recognize we\u2019re in a very efficient channel to get to that customer. ","Operator","Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse has a question on the line.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question. So, I just want to -- Lauren, maybe we can go back to where we were 90 days ago. And then kind of think ahead little bit here today. But, Europe was down I think low double digits in the first quarter. And then, you said you were able to take advantage of some of the promotional periods there. And I think you said down low single digits this quarter. So, it seems like there is some good progress. I\u2019m kind of wondering forward here, what\u2019s embedded in your second half, low single digit comp guidance by region in the U.S. and Europe. Is the thinking that Europe will slow again, now that we\u2019re passed the promotional period there? And if so, what inning do you think you\u2019re in on cleaning the channel there? I was little surprised that maybe you didn\u2019t lift the gross margin guidance for the year, given that big acceleration in the comps in Europe. I would have thought you\u2019ve been able to say hey, we\u2019re feeling a lot cleaner about the product than maybe we were 90 days ago.","Lauren Peters","The inventory discipline that we\u2019ve described and you\u2019ve certainly seen from extended period of time, applies across the region. Our European team, doing what they need to do to keep that inventory fresh and dealing with slow moving items, so that we can get to a position where we feel really good about the product set. And so, they have been hard at work on that and that\u2019s the reason why we describe an improving trend in our Foot Locker Europe business and encourage that that\u2019s a product that the customer is responding to improves as we move through the back half.","But, all of that said, right, we\u2019ve guided to a gross margin for the third quarter of 10 basis points to 40 basis points improvement, recognizing that while we\u2019ve got merchandise margin improvement being less promotional in that period that with the shift that 53rd week, we\u2019ve got some delever. And so that is the dynamic, as you think about the third quarter. Does that help?","Michael Binetti","Definitely. And then, as I look at the B&O leverage, buying and occupancy leverage you pointed to, that was the best leverage you\u2019ve seen in years on that line, albeit off a very low positive comp. Would you mind just reminding us that what caused the change in leverage point in 2Q, and then, maybe a little bit more thinking on the rest of the year. Thank you. ","Lauren Peters","This is -- after you go up against the 53rd week, we\u2019ve got this quarterly difference. So, in Q2, we had that benefit from that 53rd week shift, and that helped that leverage point on occupancy in Q2.","Operator","Kate McShane from Citi is on the line with the question. ","Kate McShane","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. My question is centered around traffic. We\u2019ve heard from several retailers this week that they saw significant lift in traffic. And while sequentially your traffic improved, it was still flat for the quarter. So, I just wondered with what seemed to be a stronger consumer, why do think traffic is still flat at the store. And is there any way to reconcile, I guess, the guidance that you gave at the beginning of the year kind of being the same versus what seems to be a stronger consumer?","Dick Johnson","Good morning, Kate. Yes. The consumer certainly is out and about. And as we look to the U.S. market, we did have flat traffic. And there is puts and takes by geography and within the U.S. there is a pretty strong customer sentiment here. So, we anticipate to see some traffic trends that will likely improve as we get deeper into the back to school season. Our consumers really are driven by the heat and the excitement that we generate. So, we have to make sure that we\u2019re driving them to the stores. But, you bring up a really valid point. We expect that there is some positive traffic out there. Certainly, customer sentiment in the U.S. seems to be high, based on some of the other things that we\u2019re reading. But, we do continue to face traffic challenges across Europe, the sentiment is not quite as high. The traffic patterns are significantly different across most of the geography in Western Europe.","Operator","Mitch Kummetz is on the line with the question.","Mitch Kummetz","Yes. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on Michael\u2019s question earlier about Europe and kind of what\u2019s embedded in the guidance, because obviously nice sequential improvement go from Q1 to Q2. You do have easier compares there in the back half. I mean, are you assuming that that business goes positive in the back half, or you think it still stays negative, just wanted to get your thoughts on that?","Dick Johnson","Yes. We don\u2019t get into that much granularity. But, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we do see the business sequentially improving. The product mix, and Lauren just referenced the good work that the European team did from an inventory management perspective. So, as they turn the assortment, we certainly expect to continue to see sequential improvement with the European business.","Mitch Kummetz","Okay. And then, on the Jordan business, I know that the tighter distribution was a drag to comp in the quarter, I imagine that the better sell through helped the merch margin. Is that what you expect in the third quarter as well as the part of the expected merch margin lift in Q3? And I am just wondering if it\u2019s -- is it a more positive impact in Q3, or how does that look?","Dick Johnson","We won\u2019t get into that level of nuance. But, as we said, we see the overall headwind for the Jordan abating a bit in the fourth quarter. So, you can infer from that that we\u2019re going to see some of the same going into the third quarter that we saw in the second quarter, right. And some of it just depends on how the launch dates move around, how the quick strikes deliver et cetera. So, it\u2019s always a work in progress with the Jordan brand. But, we certainly see some of those headwinds abating going into the fourth quarter.","Mitch Kummetz","Just real quick one for Lauren, on the SG&A, you\u2019re expecting it to delever, I think a 100 to 110 basis points this year. Can you say how much of that is from the digital investments versus maybe other discrete items, and how does that -- how should that -- how should we think about that going into 2019? Would you expect to continue to invest this heavily on the digital side, or does that start to pare back a little bit?","Lauren Peters","The digital capability investments is a big chunk of SG&A delever that we\u2019re expecting. But, there are other elements in it. We have this year the fact that we\u2019ve got more normalized incentives that we\u2019re providing. And as we have been talking about for a while now, higher minimum wages, selling wages is a big piece of our SG&A and medical costs as well. So, the guidance that we have given of 100 to 110 contemplates well with that. But specific to your question about digital capabilities and the future outlook for that, the customer is connected 24\/7, and their expectations are that we\u2019re keeping pace with how technology evolves and we want to use it to the best we can, our best capabilities to drive our business and make sure that we\u2019re connected to that customer. So, I am not ready to call 2019 yet, but it\u2019s hard to see a business that doesn\u2019t continue to invest in those capabilities.","Operator","Susan Anderson from B Riley FBR Incorporated is on the line with the question. ","Susan Anderson","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up on the SIX:02 stores and the women\u2019s business there. So, should we not necessarily expect that to improve until we start to cycle the compares from last year? And then, maybe two, if you could just kind of give us an update on those stores and the strategy there going forward. Thanks. ","Dick Johnson","Well, Susan, we talked a little bit about the fact that SIX:02 is not as driven by launch products, so when we are up against significant launches from a year ago, specifically around FENTY. It\u2019s going to continue to provide some headwinds in the back half, but certainly not as dramatic as the second quarter. The assortment mix and the change with some of the vendors that are represented in the SIX:02 stores is going very well. Carol and the team are doing a great job of reassorting the mix and getting it right.","So, we see in stores like 34 Street, like Times Square, Hollywood and Highland where SIX:02 is connected to a Foot Locker that drives significant traffic. We\u2019re able to see a really nice sales model. Some of the other mall-based stores that may not be in exactly the right place, the right location, we need to continue to work on. And clearly, there is an emphasis on growing the brand as a digitally led brand to make sure that the brand recognition is out there, the brand name is known. It\u2019s been a long time since we launched the new brands. And while we continue to put a lot of energy in it, it takes a lot of energy to get a brand name to be recognized by the consumers. So, we will continue to lead the brand digitally, continue to try to find the right rhythm in the stores, and the vendor assortment continues to improve. So, a lot of pluses on the SIX:02 business. It doesn\u2019t necessarily come through on the sales line in a quarter like the second quarter just given some of the headwinds that we saw.","Lauren Peters","And I can\u2019t help myself certainly to add that female customer is responding when we\u2019re bringing something special. And as Dick said, you can see it in the stores where it\u2019s within a Foot Locker, she comes in shopping, maybe she was coming to shop for him, but when she finds that special space that\u2019s got great product for her, she is delighted with the experience. And while she is not as launch-driven, we\u2019ve introduced product, we had the introduction of Good American, and she lined up for that. So, she likes special product, just like he does, and that\u2019s what we are trying to deliver to her.","Operator","Sam Poser from Susquehanna Financial Group is on the line with the question. ","Sam Poser","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. A few ones. One, could you talk about the actual change in the sell-through rates in Jordan, more specifically, what kind of rates you saw last year, what kind of rates you saw this year? And secondly, can you talk about the fashion or the lifestyle running businesses where you\u2019re seeing that and the lifestyle businesses in more detail as an offset to basketball because you brought up on numerous occasions the kid doesn\u2019t care necessarily, it\u2019s basketball shoe or running shoe or casual shoe. So, can you give us some details on how do you those offsets and momentum in those other categories? Thanks.","Dick Johnson","Sure, Sam. We\u2019re not going to get into the specifics of our sell-through numbers on Jordan, clearly. But, suffice it to say that we are seeing better sell-through on day of launch. We just don\u2019t have the tail because of the reduction impairs in the marketplace. So, absolutely seeing better sell-throughs and somebody asked a question earlier about does that have a positive impact on the margin. And certainly, it does. We\u2019re seeing -- I think, as you\u2019re all students of the business, you see the chunky midsole sort of phenomenon right now. Whether it\u2019s the Fila Disruptor or some models from our other vendor partners, it\u2019s all the rage on the women\u2019s side of the business and it\u2019s having an impact on the men\u2019s side of the business as well. We see things with Reebok, like Alter the Icon, where we\u2019ve been able to do some really unique things. And again, not basketball led, more of running silhouettes, in most cases are our casual silhouettes that are certainly helping offset some of the softness across the signature basketball side of things.","At the same time, you look at the Air Force 1 business, which is a great classic basketball silhouette, and it continues to be one of the strengths across our fleet. So, there is a lot of offsets to the marquee\/player basketball. And the fact that we\u2019ve seen some early views of the new LeBron shoe, I think there will be some heat coming back to signature basketball. It\u2019s just going to take a little while to get there.","Sam Poser","Okay. And then, secondly, the flow of product, the flow of newness, the speed initiatives from the brands and so on, how is that helping your flow, and are you able to write orders closer to need now and so on, and how is that evolving?","Dick Johnson","Well, it continues to evolve, Sam. I mean, all of our vendor partners are working on getting closer to market, but it\u2019s with the small percentage of the inventory at this point. But, we\u2019re changing our processes to make sure that we\u2019ve got open to buy available a little bit closer to market, because there are products that are becoming available closer to market. And we\u2019re seeing great work by all of our vendor partners to try to figure out that new model to build shoes faster, to get shoes into the marketplace faster. And we\u2019re seeing some success, but it\u2019s still with a relatively small portion of our inventory.","Sam Poser","All right. And lastly, in your guidance and the improvement in the same-store sales, what kind of change are you predicting in basketball in that number, or is it basically basketball as is and it improves as the mix and depth of the stuff that\u2019s performing well now improves?","Dick Johnson","Sam, I\u2019ve said many, many times that our consumer is driven by cool. And if cool happens to be in basketball, our consumer will be motivated by that and by basketball. Right now, there is some wins, and we talked about those in the LeBron side of things. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing such tremendous strength across the Max Air platform, Yeezys, all sorts of silhouettes, the Fila Disruptor that have nothing to do with basketball that the consumer is really excited to buy. So, the guidance for the back half reflects what we see and what we know in the marketplace today and the flow of product that we\u2019ve got coming in the next two quarters.","Operator","Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity is on the line with the question.","Pallav Saini","Good morning, this is Pallav Saini on for Camilo. Thanks for taking our question. Dick, you mentioned that you\u2019re getting more depth behind some of the strong trending platforms. Can you give us a sense of magnitude, maybe some examples on the magnitude of the increase in allocation in the second half versus the first half?","Dick Johnson","Again that\u2019s stuff that we really don\u2019t disclose. I mean, those are very competitive positions, they are all part of our relationship with our vendor partners. So, we don\u2019t get into the specifics of how product is allocated or how our allocations change quarter-to-quarter. We\u2019ve seen the order books, we know the order books, we know the flow of product, and that\u2019s all embedded in the guidance that we gave you.","Pallav Saini","Got it. And my second question is on the Power Stores. Is there any plan of opening Power Stores in the U.S.? And given the traction you\u2019re seeing with the elevated experience that you\u2019re offering in your stores in the UK, are you following a similar strategy in the U.S.? Can you maybe elaborate on some examples where you are elevating the in-store experience in the U.S. or you plan to do in the future?","Dick Johnson","Absolutely, our Power Store strategy is a multi-geographic strategy. It\u2019s not specific to the UK. We just simply had the first two opportunities based on lease and construction times to open the store at Liverpool and the store at Marble Arch on Oxford Street in London. We\u2019ve got certainly plans to open up some Power Stores in the U.S. Probably the first one that you\u2019ll see will be in the Detroit market. We\u2019ve taken some of the elements. We actually just reopened the store down on 14th Street here in New York that while I wouldn\u2019t qualify it as a Power Store, it\u2019s got many of the elements that we saw when we were over in London in Liverpool that we\u2019ve been able to bring into a more traditional store. And I think it represents the great work that our real estate and our construction team and our brand marketing teams have done to really bring the key elements of the Power Stores into a more traditional sort of store. So, that work will continue across all of our geographies. We\u2019ll open up a Power Store in Kowloon, Hong Kong in the third quarter, again, very exciting, but again it was driven by the fact that we were able to get the right property, the right lease terms, and the right construction period to make it happen.","Operator","Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank is on the line with the question.","Paul Trussell","If we take a step back to the beginning of the year, you were coming off a few tough quarters in \u201817, but you were cautiously kind of optimistic on the turn happening here in fiscal \u201818 and guided to flat to up low single digit comps at the time. Now, halfway through the year, just where do you feel like you\u2019ve had the greatest successes, and what are still some of the more meaningful challenges you\u2019re facing? I\u2019m thinking about things such as your ability to attain key product from vendors, the ability for stores to generate traffic, how you\u2019ve managed inventory, profitability turning around in certain categories and geographies, et cetera?","Dick Johnson","Well, the strength of the business, Paul, was clearly in the U.S., traffic flat, the categories -- the product heat was significant, the vendors certainly found us both digitally and online. So, I feel really good about the work that\u2019s going on in North America. The opportunities that we\u2019ve got, continue to be getting things straightened out in Europe. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about that in a couple of other questions where they did what they needed to from an inventory management perspective over the legislated sales periods in the summer time here. And now, they\u2019ll work hard to get that inventory turned, and that presents some opportunity. The team did a great job managing the expenses. I think, one of the strengths of our business is that we\u2019re able to flex expenses up and down pretty well in most cases. We continue to invest significantly in the customer facing things, getting our digital presence stronger, the mini hub tests that we talked about that we\u2019ll learn more of certainly more about as we roll them out -- roll the second one out here at the end of August. So, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. Retail is an everyday sort of focus on the details and the team is focused on delivering against what we\u2019ve talked about.","Paul Trussell","Fair enough. And then, also, you touched earlier, Lauren, on the digital investments being made and the impact it\u2019s having to SG&A this year. But, just wanted to inquire a little bit more big picture on where you think we all are in terms of the investment cycle. Certainly, I know you\u2019re not giving guidance for 2019. But, is it fair to think that the expense growth rate and the leverage hurdle will come down a bit as we look beyond this year?","Lauren Peters","We are laying some foundational stuff and beginning to see some of that come online with the investments that we\u2019ve made in the mobile capabilities and website. And those changes roll out banner by banner. So, we\u2019ll see the benefit as we get further into that. We talked a lot about our loyalty program and the changes that we\u2019re making there, and some of this technology is certainly intended to enable that element. So, it will bear fruit as we go forward, it\u2019s bearing some now but more as we go forward. But, as I described, I\u2019m not yet ready to tell you how that investment plays out over the longer term. I don\u2019t see us not continuing to invest there.","Operator","I now turn the call back to Mr. Lance.","Jim Lance","Okay. Thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll be back in my desk shortly to take follow-up calls. And please join us again for next earnings call which we anticipate will take place at 9 am on Wednesday, November 21st. The call will follow the release of our third quarter results earlier that morning. Thanks again, and good bye. ","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John Maurer","Thanks Christy and good morning everyone. Welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2017. As reported in this morning's press release, the company posted a comparable sales decline of 6% in the quarter. The company's net income was $51 million, which equated to $0.39 per share. These profit numbers include an incremental $50 million pretax charge related to our ongoing pension plan litigation, for which the company previously recorded a $100 million pretax charge in the third quarter of 2015.","Adjusting for this year's charge, which equaled $0.23 per share, non-GAAP EPS was $0.62 per share compared to last year's $0.94. As the litigation is still pending, we'll not be able to provide any additional information about the matter at this time. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the press release issued earlier this morning.","Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will start our prepared remarks today by reviewing the key factors contributing to our recent performance, our sales expectations for the rest of fiscal 2017 and the adjustments we are making to our operations in response to the changed landscape in athletic retail.","Lauren Peters, Foot Locker's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter just ended and our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2017. Dick?","Dick Johnson","Thank you, John. Before I get started with my prepared remarks, I want to acknowledge our teammates in Barcelona. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them as they try and comprehend this senseless tragedy that hit Las Ramblas in downtown Barcelona yesterday. We all stand strong with our team and the people of Barcelona and across all of Spain.","Good morning to all of you, and thank you for your interest in Foot Locker. It goes without saying that our second quarter performance clearly fell short of our expectations. We are obviously not satisfied with these results, and we're dedicating all our energy to ensure that we get our performance back on the right track. So before I discuss details specific to the quarter, let me start by outlining what we're seeing in the market more broadly that is affecting our business.","The disruption taking place today in our industry, and in retail in general, is the most significant I've seen in my quarter-century in the athletic business. The fact is that we're seeing mobile technology drive shifts in consumer behavior and spending patterns at a faster pace than our industry has been able to keep up with. With constant access to new influences, trends, information and ideas, consumers' attention spans are getting shorter, and we're seeing that they're moving from one style to the next faster than ever before. ","We, and the leading suppliers in the industry are working hard to significantly shorten the product development cycle, the ordering and manufacturing lead times, the expense of supply chain and the storytelling and marketing timelines. Today, those efforts are much discussed or in practice still in their infancy, and we have a lot more progress to make.","Although we recognize the fundamental shift in consumer behavior and have been taking steps to address the new operating environment, it is important to emphasize that we believe premium athletic, which is fueled by casualization and a trend towards healthier, more active lifestyles is still a great place to be in over the long run. Our young customers are still highly passionate about sports, music, style and the other key elements of youth culture.","We are committed to adapting our business as quickly as possible in the ever-faster speed at which they move, and we will continue to build more responsive and nimble practices into how new product is brought to market. An excellent example of the initiatives we have been taking to adapt our strategy is devoting an increasing share of capital spending to digital. This includes both customer-facing technology, such as our mobile apps, an enhanced e-commerce platform and new POS software; and back-of-the-house capabilities, such as infrastructure and data analytics.","We're also partnering with a leading technology and data analytics company to significantly elevate our omni-channel position in the market in the coming year. Another example of the key initiative is the investment we are making to create a more modern, flexible supply chain network. We believe that with the compression of product life cycles, making these investments and accelerating our efforts will keep us at the heart of sneaker culture.","We have succeeded in the past by knowing individual customers better in order to engage with them in the increasingly personal ways they expect, creating and delivering content that they find relevant, adding stores in the key locations they want us to be and improving our ability to deliver products to them ever faster. We believe these will continue to be the key ingredients of our future success.","Given the new market realities though, we're taking a hard look at overall capital spending. While this year's estimated spend of $277 million is already mostly committed, we expect to reduce next year's capital spending from the $250 million level we've previously targeted.","We do not intend to sacrifice our ability to deliver on our customers' expectations of us, but we are undergoing a comprehensive process of evaluating priorities for next year and beyond, accelerating our commitment to digital, investing in the right stores and speeding up our logistics efforts.","In a moment, Lauren will outline some of the other near-term initiatives we are putting in place to protect our earnings as we update our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2017 and navigate this choppy retail environment.","But before that, let me spend a few minutes on the second quarter. Reflecting the increased pace of changing consumer influences, sales of some recent top styles fell short of our expectation. In North America, for example, the sell-throughs of certain Jordan models slowed considerably compared to historical rates.","In Europe, we planned certain adi original styles, such as Superstars and Stan Smiths, down substantially, but they declined even more than expected. At the same time, we were affected by the limited availability of innovative new products in the market. The old multi-season's seed, ignite and rollout of cheap footwear platforms just doesn't work as effectively anymore.","In addition, the absence of sufficient depth and breadth of exciting new styles in the premium athletic channel also seems to have drawn some customers to markdown product. Therefore, the very high level of promotional activity in the market affected us more this quarter than in the past.","Importantly, we do not believe we are losing share of the market for premium athletic footwear and apparel. The vast majority of our adult footwear sales are over $100 per pair. And our data makes clear that in this segment, we are still the market leader and probably still gaining share despite the comp loss in the quarter.","Looking ahead, we expect some of the trends of the second quarter to persist through the remainder of the year. And our current top line estimate for the second half of the year is for a comparable sales loss in the 3% to 4% range, roughly the same in each quarter. As we noted on our first quarter call, we are excited by the greater availability as the fall season unfolds of select cut styles, such as VaporMax, Dualtone, Special Forces Air Force 1s and various Max iterations from Nike, along with NMDs, Tubular Shadow, EQT, X_PLR and Ultra BOOST from Adidas. At a much smaller scale, we also expect our Vans business to grow nicely.","While this improved product growth should lift our comps for the rest of the year from Q2's level, the pluses are not expected to fully offset what we now anticipate will be slower sell-throughs of certain Jordan footwear and apparel styles, a still sluggish signature basketball business and large down-trending platforms such as Superstars, Stan Smiths and Roshe Run. Into next year and over the longer horizon though, we see tremendous opportunities to get the premium end of the athletic industry growing again at a consistently strong pace.","The innovation pipeline at Nike continues to be second to none with a number of new ideas coming to market beginning later this year. The speed initiatives that they and the other vendors are investing in should also begin to get scale by some point next year. We expect adi to continue creating new products and connecting them with their assets, such as Kanye West and Pharrell, while some of the other brands, Under Armour, PUMA and Vans, for example, should reap more of the benefits of the investments they are making in product developments and storytelling.","For our part, we will continue to invest in creating compelling experiences for our customers. At the premium end of the market, most of our customers don't want to just buy a specific product at the end of spring, they want that product to have a connection to an experience they find meaningful and want to participate in. That experience could be a special event in a store, being notified out or discovering a video on our website or YouTube channel of an athlete or celebrity wearing or discussing the latest product, an interaction with their friends while touching and feeling the product or simply a conversation about sneakers with one of our stripers or other store associates. ","For that reason, we do not believe our vendors selling product directly on Amazon is an imminent threat. There is no indication that any of our vendors intend to sell premium athletic product, $100-plus interest that we offer directly via that sort of distribution channel. For lower-priced, largely undifferentiated product, sure, Amazon and other online sales channels are increasing their share of the sneaker market. ","However, we believe our vendors agree with us that consistently selling their premium aspirational product requires great storytelling, great relevance to the influences on our customers' lives as well as engaging in digital and in-store experiences. We also believe that most of our suppliers are seeing more clearly than ever how important and authentic our customer connections are and how our proposition makes Foot Locker, Inc. such a critical partner in their future success. ","Our proposition is clear, great multi-branded stores in which to shop and buy, great digital sites and mobile connectivity, outstanding knowledgeable sales associates, duke merchants and unparalleled customer insights, all of which leads to great experiences for our consumers. We already have a lot of great stores. And we'll continue to invest in key markets and upgrading our top stores while, at the same time, looking to exit less productive stores. Of course, we've been doing that for years. By the end of the year, we will have closed more than 1,000 stores just since 2010.","In this environment though, we are accelerating our ongoing process of reviewing our store portfolio. We'll be as aggressive as necessary in rationalizing our fleet to help improve our occupancy leverage as we navigate the repositioning of malls in the U.S. As a result, we'll be closing more stores this year than the 100 we mentioned at the beginning of the year.","However, due to the disciplined investment process we followed in recent years and the related increase of productivity we have achieved, we don't believe we have a store productivity problem in our core banners or store fleet that overall is significantly too large. Stores remain an incredibly important component of the experience most of our customers expect on their journey to select and in purchasing the latest cool sneakers.","For now, let me close my part of the prepared remarks by saying our eyes are wide open that the athletic retail game has changed. At Foot Locker, we're not used to going backwards, and we won't be satisfied until we are back on an upwards sales and earnings trajectory. Our entire leadership team is fully engaged in addressing the current challenges, as is our Board of Directors.","Given the relatively recent deterioration in comp store sales, remember, comps in March and April were up high single-digits. We are in the process of reviewing with our board the longer-range options to adjust our operations beyond what we are already doing today. While we manage through this transition period, we will stay truly focused on delivering value to our shareholders.","The overarching issue, in our opinion, revolves around premium product and the speed at which innovation comes to market in meaningful climates. To that end, we are also fully engaging with our leading suppliers to build even stronger partnerships to address the challenges jointly. With the success we've had together with our vendors in recent years and the capital we have invested in exciting stores and digital experiences for our customers, we believe no one is better positioned to lead the way back to sustained growth importantly.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lauren.","Lauren Peters","Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everyone. As Dick mentioned, our second quarter was far more challenging than we anticipated when we last spoke in May. We highlighted then that as the second quarter got underway, sales were trending lower than the high single-digit gains we achieved in March and April. As it turned out, the trend weakened further during the period, with May comps declining at a low single-digit pace, while June and July finished down towards the high end of mid-single digits.","Let's now review some of the factors that contributed to the shortfall. Footwear was our primary challenge with comparable sales down mid-single digits. Sales were down across all genders, with mid-single digit comp declines in men's and women's footwear, while children's footwear sales decreased low double-digits.","Similar to the trends we have seen in recent quarters, strong demand for lifestyle running silhouettes, including the NMD, EQT, and Tubular Shadow from adidas and the VaporMax, Tuned Air and Huarache from Nike, led to a double-digit gain in men's running. Our business gain was not enough to offset double-digit declines in both basketball and casual style.","The loss in women's footwear was driven by the shift away from Superstars and Stan Smiths that Dick mentioned earlier on, while the kids business experienced the biggest miss to our expectations because of the follow-up of those two styles and a higher exposure to Jordan and marquee basketball.","Apparel sales posted a slight gain, while accessories were down low double-digit. Within apparel, our women's business had a strong comp gain, though the double-digit increase was partially driven through markdown. While our men's apparel sales were relatively flat, our kids business was down mid-single digits. A strength in our international markets was offset by softer sales in the U.S.","Overall, windwear and branded T-shirts from Nike and Adidas sold well across genders, but were offset by softness across some seasonal apparel, including shorts and licensed products and certain brand Jordan styles. And in the promotional retail environment, ASPs and footwear were up low single-digits. While in apparel, they increased low double-digits, driven by our shift to more premium assortments. Unit sales of both footwear and apparel were down high single-digits.","As a group, our store divisions posted a 7.5% comparable sales decline. On the positive side, Foot Locker Canada produced a solid comp increase, driven by gains in both footwear and apparel. Total sales in constant currency at Foot Locker Canada were up double digits compared to a year ago, driven by the comp gain and the addition of some key new stores, including a Jordan Jumpman location in Toronto.","SIX:02 posted a high single-digit comp increase, while total sales were up 45%, lifted by the SIX:02 location inside of our New York flagship stores. The rest of our store divisions posted comparable sales declines. Foot Locker in the U.S. and Sidestep were both down mid-single digits. Foot Locker Europe, Champs Sports and Runners Point declined high single-digits, while comp sales at Footaction and Kids Foot Locker decreased double-digit.","Our direct-to-customer businesses produced an overall comparable sales gain of 5.4%. This includes a mid-single-digit sales increase at our store banner.com business in the U.S., a low single-digit comp sales gain at Eastbay, and another 20%-plus gain for our digital sales in Europe and Canada. In addition, we successfully launched our e-commerce functionality in Australia during the second quarter. Overall, direct-to-customer sales increased to 12.7% of total sales, up from 11.5% a year ago.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin decreased 340 basis points to 29.6% of sales. The lower rate was driven by a 200-basis-point decrease in our merchandise margins and 140 basis points of deleverage on our occupancy and buyers' compensation expenses. The lower merchandise rate was driven by a higher markdown, both in-stores and online.","We took higher markdowns in response to the promotional environment, to drive traffic, which was down mid-single digits in both the U.S. and abroad, and in order to clear slower-moving product prior to back-to-school. SG&A expense dollars decreased 3.1%, compared to the prior year.","However, as a percent of sales, SG&A rose to 19.9% from 19.7% last year. As the quarter progressed, we adjusted our variable expenses, such as store wages, partners accruals, banking and marketing to better align with sales. However, the magnitude of the sale slowdown led to the slight deleverage.","Depreciation expense was $42 million in the quarter, up $3 million from last year, reflecting the higher level of investments we've been making in our new high-profile stores, store remodels, digital capabilities and supply chain to position ourselves to meet our customer expectations.","On a GAAP basis, our tax rate came in at 30.9%. This is 500 basis points lower than last year due to the litigation charge John mentioned, which reduced our U.S. income, where our tax rate is highest. On a non-GAAP basis, our tax rate came in at 34.1%, in-line with our full-year guidance.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of inventory, a 3.7% decrease from last year's second quarter, as we took aggressive action to ensure that our inventory levels remained in-line with sales, and thus remain productive and turning appropriately in the face of a sales shortfall. On a constant-currency basis, inventory decreased 4.9%, compared to the 4.3% total sales decrease.","We ended the quarter with $1.043 billion of cash and cash equivalent, an increase of $98 million from the end of Q2 last year. Our current cash balance is also virtually the same as of the beginning of the year, indicative of the company's ability to deliver good cash flow even in a challenging sales environment.","We spent $21 million to repurchase 350,000 shares during the second quarter and returned $41 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend. We resumed buying shares following our Q1 conference call. However, once we saw that sales trends had flowed more than expected, we temporarily halted our repurchase activity. That being said, we have almost our entire $1.2 billion share repurchase authorization available, and we remain fully committed to returning cash to investors.","With management and the board fully confident in our ability to reaccelerate the business over time, we will consider a full range of share repurchase alternatives, including accelerated share repurchase programs, open market purchases and 10b5-1 programs as we reenter the market to buy back shares.","We invested $75 million of capital into the business during the second quarter, bringing our first half total capital expenditures to $150 million. We ended the quarter with 3,359 owned stores, which includes 24 openings, 38 remodels or relocations and 19 store closures. The openings include a new Foot Locker flagship store in Prague, the new Champs Sports location on Chicago State Street and the first Footaction store in Canada.","Pending the review of our store base that Dick mentioned, we currently expect to close at least 135 stores, up from the 100 we previously guided to. We still expect to open about 90 new stores, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. So as Dick mentioned, we are now planning comparable sales to decline in the 3% to 4% range in both the third and fourth quarters. With this outlook, we will likely see further deleverage in the second half.","Gross margin is likely to decrease 230 to 250 basis points in Q3 and 150 to 170 basis points in Q4 on a 13-week basis. The proportion of occupancy deleverage and lower merchandise margins, as we saw in the second quarter, should be similar in the second half. SG&A will likely be up 70 to 100 basis points of the rate of sales in both the third and fourth quarters. This is more than the 20-basis-point increase in Q2, which included a reversal of Q1 bonus accruals. ","As a result, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to decrease between 20% to 30% in the second half of 2017. As a reminder, our non-GAAP numbers are on a 52-week basis. We currently expect the 53rd week to produce incremental earnings of approximately $0.12 per share. ","Before we move on to your questions, I want to reiterate that we are already moving ahead with meaningful expense and operational changes, and our top priority is to continue to assess the best ways to address the top line challenges ahead of us in this exceptional retail environment.","As Dick said, these include evaluating our largely productive store base, our total level of future capital spending, as well as the split and timing of spend between digital, stores and logistics, and various SG&A initiatives to creating a more flexible, efficient organization. Of course, we will also continue to manage inventory rigorously.","Given our strong financial position, highly collaborative relationships with our vendors and deep connections with our customers, we believe that we remain especially well-positioned to reposition our business and succeed regaining our momentum.","Christy, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt McClintock from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matt McClintock","Hi guys, good morning everyone.","Dick Johnson","Good morning, Matt.","Matt McClintock","Dick, I was wondering if we could talk about the allocations of new and innovative product that you talked about, and that's where some of your optimism is for maybe an improvement in underlying trends. I recall last quarter, you're optimistic about new and innovative product in more allocations in the back half of this year, yet the delta between the back half now and where you were thinking before of mid-single digits before is pretty wide. And I just want to know, did you take down your expectations for EBIT allocations of that product or the underlying performance of that product? And then could you just talk about the sell-through trends that you saw for that type of product, Air, VaporMax, et cetera, this quarter? Did any of that slow at all? Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Well, let's see. We haven't taken down our expectation of those allocations on the hot products, certainly not. We still see the same thing that we saw when we were on the call in the first quarter. The thing that's a bit different than when we were in the first quarter is how some of the other silhouettes have fallen off. The speed with which some of the platforms that we certainly were cautious about fell off faster than we expected, and that's really what leads to the delta or probably the revised look at the back half. ","So the innovation, the storytelling, the great product that we talked about in Q1, we still see those allocations and the flow into the marketplace up in the back half of the quarter, of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, so the back half of the year. But it's really some of the sell-throughs. We continue to see great sell-through when there's a relevant story and excitement around specific launches. But if it's just another shoe that we launch on a Saturday, the consumer, especially in second quarter, where there's not a real drive to the market for consumers, right, it's our smallest quarter by a fairly long shot. ","And there's no real call to retail now that we get in the back-to-school time frame. Fourth quarter's got holiday. There's some reasons for consumers to be out, and that's what's gives us some guarded optimism, if you will, about the trends improving a bit in the back half.","Matt McClintock","Okay. And then as a follow-up, if I could ask about the share repurchase. You maintained a pretty sizable cash balance. But historically, you've always maintained a pretty sizable cash balance. And I'd just like to understand how you think about just that cash balance? Where it can go, what's necessary? And what you could potentially dip into should you want to become a little bit more aggressive on share repurchases. Thanks.","Lauren Peters","Our priorities remain the same. Number one is investing in the business. But you've heard us describe that we're thinking about what that CapEx looks like next year and the split between digital stores and our logistics system. But an equally important priority for us is returns of cash to the shareholders, both through the dividend and share repurchase.","So we've got almost the full $1.2 billion. We recognize value. We do have to navigate that. And about 70% of the cash is offshore, but we do have ability to bring some of that back tax efficiently. And we have our revolver. So with all of that said and flexibility, we recognize value, and we'll proceed accordingly.","Matt McClintock","Thanks a lot. Best of luck.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Camilo Lyon","Thanks, good morning. Dick, you made some comments with respect to the product pipeline heading into 2018 that gives you some optimism. Could you maybe articulate and take down a bit more what gives you that confidence that there's an improving innovation that's coming forth? And if that could help turn some of the trends here into early 2018?","Dick Johnson","Part of it's innovation, Camilo. The React products from Nike will start to flow. But part of it's increased availability of key products like VaporMax, some of the things that we called out in the prepared remarks. And we see various iterations of that, various iterations of Air product coming through, unexpected occurrences of Flyknit and Primeknit shoes coming through. As adi has talked about there's a bit of Boost constraint still, but we see improving allocations around Ultra Boost and some of the key products there. So it's a combination of innovation and actually flowing quantities of that innovative product into the marketplace.","Camilo Lyon","If you think about the mix of the product that's fallen off relative to the things that you are excited about, at what point does that start to favor - at what point in 2018 does that start to turn more positively in favor of the things that are in greater demand? In other words, how long does it really necessitate for you to clear out of the stuff, the slower turn in Jordan, the Roshes, the Stans and the Superstars?","Dick Johnson","Yes. I mean, the exposures continue to lessen as we go into the year, further into the year. And obviously, we're going to start lapping some softer basketball numbers, which certainly helps us well. But the life cycle of product is moving much quicker. As we've talked about, this consumer has access to an awful lot of information about products. So while we buy on a 6-month future sort of window, trying to carve off some open-to-buy that have more flexibility for in-season opportunity is just really important. So those big platforms, we're a big chain. So we buy big quantities of those platforms. So cycling through them does take some time. We want to be responsible in the marketplace, responsible with our markdowns, et cetera. So - but those exposures do continue to decrease, Camilo.","Camilo Lyon","The final question I have is, you took a few minutes to discuss your thoughts on the Nike-Amazon relationship and where you sit from a premium distribution perspective. Clearly, that's top of mind within the investment community. If you could just maybe give a little bit more detail as to what it is that you guys are having, the types of conversations you're having with your branded partners in terms of distinguishing yourselves truly and making the destination, the Foot Locker destination one that can be distinct from everyone else in the marketplace, such that there isn't this product ubiquity across the channel.","Dick Johnson","Well, I think it's - probably the deepest conversations, Camilo, are around an integrated marketplace that combines great digital experiences with great physical experiences. We have a great example of that a couple of weeks ago in our Times Square store. We saw - I haven't talked about a Converse shoe on the earnings call for a long time, but we had a great collaboration with Converse One Star and Tyler the Creator, that was available exclusively at Foot Locker, we saw kids lined up. So the physical part of it, being able to come in and interact with some sort of activation, is part of that experience that the consumer's looking for.","We know for well that the consumers are on the digital phone constantly, their digital device constantly. And we have to create great content that's relevant and great stories that are relevant to the consumer, but we also know that, that consumer still has an expectation around the physical space, in an integrated marketplace or integrated solution that they find both digital and physical part of the experience that they want when they're looking for premium sneakers.","Camilo Lyon","Okay. Best of luck. Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Camilo.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Svezia with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Christopher Svezia","Yes Wedbush. Thank you. Good morning everyone. So I guess, first question, just on the inventory component, maybe if you can just talk about where your inventory sit today? What level under your guidance in terms of gross margin assumes probably some level of markdown? So just kind of talk about where your inventory is, how you're positioned relative to those categories you want to be in versus those categories you need to get out of at this point.","Dick Johnson","Chris, I think the comments were pretty clear. The team did a great job in managing the inventory as the sales started to slow down. So our inventory actually was down a little bit more than our sales loss, which - and my hats off to the team for reacting as quickly as they could in an environment where you place your orders on a future basis. So, we continue to work our way through some of those slower-moving platforms and products that we talked about.","Certainly, the guidance that Lauren gave around gross margin is reflective of what we expect our markdown cadence to be in the back half. So the team continues to evolve and move the product assortments. But as I said on the last question, we buy a lot of products. So to move through it does take a little bit of time and takes some markdowns to accomplish.","Christopher Svezia","When you step back and look at the guidance that you've given for the second half, do you feel like you've taken all, at least in terms of visibility, the variables into place, whereby you could see less risks to the story at this point? Or just how do you think about the second half in terms of the puts and takes on each one of the elements, whether it's margin or comp?","Dick Johnson","Well, we've been pretty thorough as we've looked at the guidance that we were going to provide today, Chris. And given what we see today, and that's always the caveat, when we were on the call in May, we certainly didn't see the business dropping off as rapidly as it did. But I think our team has taken a really strong view of what the reality of the marketplace is. And I think both from a merchandise perspective and from a financial perspective, we've got that built into the forecast. I don't know, Lauren, if you want to add anything.","Lauren Peters","I don't know what I can add to that. We have taken lessons learned out of Q2 about what the customer - or how they reacted to the product. And we have applied that to what we see coming into the stores and the sites in the back half, and thought through how to think through the margin implications of making sure their inventory ends at a good place. So we remain focused on everything we can do on our SG&A to make sure that that's aligned, and we've added all of that up into the guidance that we've given you.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. And finally, just on the supply chain you mentioned speed to market and things potentially that you can do, what are you doing exactly in the supply chain and when can we see at least some impact through the P&L?","Dick Johnson","We're making our inventory more readily available, right? Some of the investments that we're making in the IFSC world and our digital infrastructure world is to make it more seamless for our consumer to have access to inventory across all of our stores, their local store, the stores that they might be near. If you think about it, we've got roughly 2,300 distribution points in U.S. And if we leverage that inventory, and that's really what some of the investment is against, that will help.","We've got big stores, big volume stores in key cities, where we will start to install some mini hubs that we can be more proactive with both supplying the stores with inventory on a daily basis, but also allow us to do more same-day shipping into some of those key urban areas. So there's - it's ongoing. I don't know that there will be a day Chris that we flip the page and it automatically happens. But these are ongoing improvements that we've been working on and that we're certainly committed to accelerating at this point.","Lauren Peters","Chris, I'm going to add that in the distribution center, we've had - our largest distribution center historically has been focused on serving the stores and another distribution focused on direct-to-customer shipment. And a big chunk of the investment is making the distribution centers really able to do both effectively to make the best use of the inventory and service the customers as best as we can.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. Thank you and all the best to you, appreciate it.","Lauren Peters","Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Pallavi Bakshi","Hi, this is Pallavi on for Christian. We want to know a little bit more about the digital investments that you guys mentioned as part of your initiatives. Should we be expecting changes in your marketing strategy? And then what's the timing of these investments maybe over the near- to medium-term? Thanks.","Dick Johnson","Very similar to the supply chain, these are ongoing investments. We just launched the - our Launch Reservation app was released on a national basis that have been constrained to a number of states. So that's certainly an improvement and an expansion of that great application for our consumers to make the launch process even a little bit easier for them. Certainly, our expenditures on our digital marketing front and content creation continue to change. Our app development around the Foot Locker app continues to expand. ","We're going to accelerate, and part of that is a platform conversation as well. We've got a new POS system that's about to be rolled out. So they're all part of this digital evolution. And again, there's been an acceleration of what we're doing, and we continue to expect that acceleration to go on into 2018. And this is sort of an investment that I don't believe will ever be over, right? I mean, we need to continue to adapt to the changing environment that our consumers live and shop in certainly.","John Maurer","Okay, Christy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jay Sole","Great, thanks so much. I think you talked about Amazon a few times earlier in the call. Can you also talk about how - you mentioned the vendor partnerships that you're working together with key branded partners to create those premium experiences. Can you just talk about, what Foot Locker does combined with what the brand.com's do are working together to segment the market to drive growth for both? Do you see them working collaboratively? Or how is that relationship with your partners developing?","Dick Johnson","I see we're working very collaboratively, Jay. I think that our vendor partners have been clear that they have their plans around their DTC and other channels, but our vendor partners have been very good at their segmentation and distribution strategies. And that's allowed us to be successful at the premium end of sneaker culture, and that's where we will continue to do our business.","So it's very collaborative, and it's really all of us trying to move at the speed of our customer. The supply chain, the product development cycles, the delivery cycles, all of those things need to move faster. And the utilization of the assets and the resources that we got from our distribution centers to our stores, to working closer with our vendor partners to create exciting digital experiences and physical experiences for our consumer is all part of it. But I see it as very collaborative.","Lauren Peters","This recognition that we effectively have reached that alpha kid, if you will, that style leader, they've got a number of reasons that they want to be able to come in to our stores and on our website, then compare the product across the different brand suppliers, we let them do that efficiently and interact with that breadth of assortments in a way that's tough for them to do, purely digitally, purely with vertical.","Jay Sole","Got it. And maybe if I can follow up on that. Just to actually switch topics a little bit. The Jordan brand sounded like some of the styles down-trended in the quarter maybe a little faster than you expected. It seems like there's been a lot of quantity in the marketplace of some of those retro Jordans that are really popular. Can you talk about what you're seeing with that brand? Is it the sneakerhead community has really just switched teams from Jordan to Adidas, and there's just not enough supply of Ultra Boost out there? Or is there something bigger going on? That's the question.","Dick Johnson","Well, I think there's many things going on, Jay. The relationship with Jordan and Michael himself and the shoes is still incredibly high in the marketplace. But the fact is that today's kid really needed to be connected to a story. When that happens, when the product is right, we see - still see lineups, and we still see Launch Reservation apps that are ready to blow up with the amount of activity.","But there's been - even though we saw some slowdown in some key models, we saw some great successes with things like the 6 Rings, the Son of Mars, the Spizike, the Dub Zero, all very, very positive. So it's the right story, the right product, the right connectivity with the customer makes all the difference. And brand Jordan is one of the great brands that we work with. And I know that Larry and the team at Jordan are working as hard to make that connectivity with the customer real every time they launch a product.","Jay Sole","Okay great. Thanks so much.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Jay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Randy Konik from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Randy Konik","Thanks for taking my question. I just want to go talk about thoughts around, I guess, ASP versus unit velocity as you're thinking about the back-half revenue comp guide. How do you think about that kind of dynamic changing or not changing relative to the front half of the year? That's my first question.","Lauren Peters","The expectation is not that that changes markedly from what we saw. So again ASPs have been up, units down in footwear. And so the Kid is still looking for us to bring them this marquee level product that is our positioning, and we\u2019re bringing them the cool stuff. We haven't seen price resistance when they are finding the product cool. So we will look for that dynamic to remain in place.","Randy Konik","Okay. And then did you see any kind of noticeable difference in comp trend in the quarter in, let's say, your urban markets or urban-located stores versus suburbia-located stores? Just trying to get a sense if there's any kind of differential between, let's say, product promotion or product changes or what have you? I'm just trying to get a sense of what's going on with the business from an urban versus suburban perspective.","Dick Johnson","Randy, we don't get into deep, deep discussions around that. But the one place that we have seen a little bit of a slowdown is markets that are heavily penetrated by the Hispanic consumer. There's been an awful lot written rated about it. And the share-of-wallet, I'm just not sure of that consumer spending in totality.","The hindsight will be 2020 on that. But across - obviously, when we have a change the way that we saw the chain, we saw the change pretty much across the marketplace, across the geographies and across the banners, other than the couple that Lauren called out as the positive.","Randy Konik","Got you, okay. And then I appreciate the discipline around capital intensity and bringing it down next year. So how do you think about - I guess, the story sounds more like that the changes that need to occur in the industry are more quicken up the supply chain speed. We need to probably have less SKUs or faster SKU turns or need more product innovation, newness. Is that the real issue from your perspective versus you don't see as much issue with traffic? I know the traffic was down, I think you said mid-single digit in the quarter. Just how are you thinking about the need for the supply chain changes from an industry perspective relative to the real state changes or lack thereof that need to occur in the industry?","Dick Johnson","There's some of each in the formula. Randy, the consumer has to have a reason to - a compelling reason to shop. And I think that the ability for us to create those experiences and those stories with our vendor partners, market, Nike always uses the phrase, they want to add it to amplify. And I think that means smaller SKU count with better amplification of units, et cetera. And that's how we...","Lauren Peters","And that can do great stories","Dick Johnson","Yes. And that's a great point. It's great story that ultimately this consumer is after. So we have to get better as an industry. We have to get faster as an industry. We have to tell better stories in our stores and on our digital sites. And that will keep this consumer. We know that the consumer casualization, the more healthy lifestyle, those are real things. Sneakers are definitely at the center of all of that. It's our making sure that we've got the compelling stories and compelling product and compelling experiences that motivate our consumer to drop that share of wallet in our channels.","Randy Konik","Got you. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Dick Johnson","Thank you, Andy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Krasik","Hi thanks for taking my question. I got two, first one on basketball, second one on the stores. So we've seen quarters where the basketball has turned negative, and then it's recovered. Some of it has been price point on the Nike signature. Now it's Jordan retro. I'm just wondering how you think about this business overall being able to comp if basketball is down, both in the back half of this year and next year as well? And then I have a follow-up on the stores.","Dick Johnson","Scott, we've talked on a number of calls that our buyers and our consumers are really after cool product. And certainly, basketball is an important category for us. Some of the things that I mentioned earlier with - when you think about the React product that's coming from Nike and the Hyperdunk 2017 and the Jordan Super Fly 2017, you think about Nike taking over the NBA jersey side of things, that sponsorship, so the connectivity that you get between all of that and our House of Hoops, there's guarded optimism around the basketball category. ","But our team is really focused on finding and buying and assorting the best product regardless of category and telling great stories around that to increase the connectivity with our consumers. So basketball, certainly a piece of that, we expect to see some good things from the Paul George products, some of the React product that I talked about, the Harden shoe from Adidas. There's an awful lot of good basketball products out there. When we tell a compelling story around it, we're optimistic that the consumer will buy.","Scott Krasik","Okay thanks. And then, Lauren, you did accelerate the store closing plan a little bit this year, have you considered what it would look like or your P&L would like, how you manage the SG&A if you decided to close a significant number of stores?","Lauren Peters","Well, that's the conundrum for us because we have been closing stores. As we've cited that number, 1,000 doors by the end of this year in the last seven years, right, since 2010. So we've been addressing underperforming units all along and focused on lifting their productivity. So when we look at the fleet, it is largely productive. We get into conversations around U.S. malls, the different grades of them of, A, B, C, D and what they look like, I mean, for us, C and D level malls can still be very productive.","Ours are very productive doors profit-wise. The volume's going to be lower than A and B, but they're still profitable. So if we look at all of that and we end up focused on where do we think those malls are going to evolve to and how do we position ourselves with as much flexibility to navigate that repositioning, so where we have any concern at all about the long-term health of a mall, we've taken shorter lease life to give ourselves flexibility.","Dick Johnson","Even as the mall sort of deteriorates, Scott, one thing to remember is that the customer's not leaving those areas. And our customers look to us to be a destination. A fair number of those areas in the stores that I'm assuming you would reference to closing, we transact a lot of business in cash. And that consumer's not necessarily comfortable utilizing their digital device because of a lack of a credit card or choosing not to use credit card, et cetera. So it's about us positioning ourselves in the right places in those markets, not necessarily just closing doors.","Lauren Peters","Yes. So we have a fair amount of volume certainly outside the U.S., but happens off-mall. We're very experienced in off-mall retail. So we look at all of that and how we think properties will evolve and where we can position ourselves to pick up the traffic should the mall go away.","Scott Krasik","Right. And just what is your average lease life across the fleet?","Lauren Peters","Well, where we have no concern about our property, we'll sign up for 10 years plus options. And where we do have concerns, it can be a year or less, right. So on average, it's probably not that helpful.","Scott Krasik","Okay. Thanks and good luck.","Lauren Peters","Thanks.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Scott.","John Maurer ","Okay Christy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Poser with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Sam Poser","Thanks for taking my questions. Okay. I mean, I guess, the question is one of - Michael Gould, the ex-CEO of Bloomingdale's, was on a television financial program yesterday. He was talking about how people are playing it a little safe. Are you guys missing some vendors here? Are you too aligned with, let's say, Adidas and Nike and PUMA and so on? Are there other vendors that are sort of fashion-athletic vendors that are out there that you may historically have not done business with that you're missing and need to get involved with as they are growing, especially those with some heritage? I won't name any, but...","Dick Johnson","Well, Sam, our team - I think as you know, our team is pretty proactive in trying to find that next big thing. And we haven't done a ton of business in the past to advance. But as that becomes very, very relevant in modern culture, in youth culture today, our team is up the ante with the folks at Vans. And you look at that and say, \"Great opportunity for them to take advantage of it.\" We are challenged a little bit of finding those people with athletic heritage. We've got a nice business with PUMA.","We've got a nice business with New Balance. We've got a nice business with ASICS. Many of those players are relatively speaking one genre or one category of shoe. So it's hard for them to get significant penetration in our business. But our team is pretty proactive in going out and trying to find that next thing. It's a little easier on the apparel side because there are things that you can test and try and roll out. But on the footwear side, it's a fairly limited roster.","Sam Poser","Okay. I mean - all right. Well, I'll get to that later. I guess, the other question, is the Adidas, I mean, how much of this is not having the right product versus changing the communication like pushing ahead on how you speak to those consumers? I mean, you always have to have the right product. That's a given. It's never good enough even when business is really good. So, I guess, the question is, is the speed of change in the expectations? Is this a product change? Or is this that you guys really had to ramp up the way - you already talked about stories and so on, the way you tell the stories and so on? I mean, what is the more dramatic change there? Because I assume that you guys are never satisfied with the products. So from a communication perspective, how are you changing it? What really needs to get done to do this properly?","Dick Johnson","Well, the customer's moving so fast, Sam, that we have to stay really relevant with them. The Tyler, the Creator Converse One Star example that I gave you is a good example of how we need to bring excitement to the consumer. The One Star shoe, which Converse is working hard to make relevant again, really hasn't had a lot of traction. But when you get the right combination of creator - along with Tyler, the Creator, along with the shoe and tell that story, the consumer reacts. So it's - part of it is the storytelling and the connectivity with the consumer. Part of it is the right flow of great product. And working with our vendors and collaborating on both is what we're doing.","Sam Poser","Alright, well thank you and good luck. Appreciate it.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Sam.","John Maurer","Alright Christy, I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question.","Operator","Perfect. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So Lauren, if we go back to the last period of sustained negative comps, I think it was around eight years ago, gross margins troughed in the mid- to high-20s. I guess, can you talk about what would be different today? And just any actions you can take to protect gross margins if comps were to remain negative multiyear?","Lauren Peters","Well, we've invested in our systems that help us get right product to right place at the right time, and that certainly has been part of the improvement in gross margin over the years. Those investments still pay dividends. One bit of it, which helps us write that order with all of that intelligence about right place, right time, it is really just coming online to the organization now. So that should bear fruit for us going forward. But then it's really about managing your buy appropriately.","The speed initiative will be very helpful and help in that margin, right, because we cut out lead time. We're doing a better job of buy with demand, and that supports the margins. But because we've got that occupancy bit in there, that is leveraged. But we, I think, described pretty thoroughly what we're doing on the fleet side. And then, of course, there's the apparel, which continues to be an opportunity for us, and we believe long-term, a margin opportunity.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then Dick just as you break down your back comp guidance what are you embedding for traffic in AUR within the down 3 to 4 comps and I guess more micro, is August within this range or how best to think about progression of trends in the quarter?","Dick Johnson","Well, August is built into - we don't give, to the moment, guidance or updates on where we're at. So obviously, it's certainly built into the guidance that we've given. We continue to see traffic down a bit. AURs, we expect - as Lauren talked about our average selling price, we expect that to be flat to up slightly.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Lauren Peters","Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Thank you.","John Maurer","Okay. Thank you. That's all we have time for today, but we will look forward to talking to you again on our next earnings call, which should be at 9 AM on Friday, November 17 following the release of our third quarter results earlier that morning. Thanks again and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect."],"9491":["Foot Locker, Inc.

Mr. Lance, you may begin.","James Lance","Thanks, operator. Welcome everyone to Foot Locker, Inc.'s third quarter earnings conference call. As reported in today\u2019s earnings release, the company reported a strong quarter with net income of $125 million or $1.16 per share in the third quarter, compared to net income of $130 million or $1.14 per share last year.","Included in this year\u2019s GAAP results is a pretax gain of $4 million in connection with the acquisition of a Canadian distribution center lease and related assets, partially offset by an incremental $1 million charge related to the pension matter that we have spoken about in the past.","Last year\u2019s results included a $2 million charge related to the same pension matter, offset by $23 million of tax benefits related to U.S. tax reform. On a non-GAAP basis, third quarter earnings were $122 million or $1.13 per share, a 19% increase from $108 million or $0.95 per share last year.","Unless otherwise noted, the figures and rates mentioned during our call today will be based on non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in this morning's press release.","We will begin our remarks with Lauren Peters, Foot Locker's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide details on our third quarter performance, along with our financial outlook for the fourth quarter. Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will then provide highlights from our third quarter performance, along with an update on our strategic initiatives and our product pipeline.","Lauren?","Lauren Peters","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to report strong sales and earnings growth for our third quarter. Our team executed well this quarter, delivering a comparable sales increase of 5.7% combined with improvement in both our gross margin and SG&A rate. Collectively, this led to the double-digit increases in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share.","Total reported sales rose 3.9%. Similar to the second quarter of 2019, the impact of foreign currencies reduced sales by about $23 million. On a constant currency basis, total sales increased 5.1%. Winning with our customer when it matters most, we had a very strong back-to-school season in August and September, posting high single-digit comp gains in each month.","October, the lowest volume month of the quarter, produced a low single-digit comp increase. Breaking out the comparable sales by channel, both stores and direct-to-customer delivered excellent results. Sales at our DTC channel produced the strongest comp gain, rising 11.4%. Also impressive was the performance at our stores, which increased 4.7%. As a percent of total sales, direct-to-customer rose to 15.3% for the quarter, up from 14.5% last year. Almost all of the divisions performed well during the third quarter.","In North America, Foot Locker Canada led the way once again with its second consecutive low double-digit comp gain. The results of Champs Sports, Foot Locker U.S., and Kids Foot Locker were also notable, with each delivering a high single-digit comp gain. Footaction increased low-single digits.","In our international markets, Foot Locker Pacific had the strongest performance, posting its fourth consecutive double-digit increase. Foot Locker Europe and the Runners Point Group each produced a low single-digit increase. The only division to post a negative comp was Eastbay, which was down high-single digits. Dick will touch on the Eastbay results in his remarks.","Looking at our sales by family of business. Our comparable sales gains were driven by footwear, which was up high-single digits, while apparel and accessories together were down high-single digits. Within footwear, the strength was broad-based with men's sales up high-single digits, women's up mid-single digits, and kids up double-digits.","Strong growth in men's basketball, which increased double-digits combined with a mid single-digit gain in men's running were the key drivers this quarter. The growth in women's was fueled by Classic Basketball and court style.","The back-to-school period demonstrates the strong connections we have with our younger customers and their parents. The terrific performance in kids footwear was even broader with strong growth in almost every one of our divisions and fueled by strength across grade school, preschool, and infant sizes with double-digit gains in basketball and running and positive results in casual silhouettes.","Our apparel business remained challenging, down high-single digits. However, we made progress in a number of areas. For example, the strong results at Foot Locker Canada and Foot Locker Pacific each benefited from double-digit gains in apparel. Foot Locker U.S., our women's apparel business was up double-digits, and in Europe it was kids' apparel that delivered a double-digit gain. Dick will touch on some of the product details in his remarks.","The trend with store traffic was unchanged in the third quarter, down low-single digits overall, while conversion improved. We had traffic gains at Foot Locker Pacific, Foot Locker Canada and Sidestep. Average selling prices rose high-single digits, while units were down low-single digits primarily due to a decline in our apparel penetration.","Turning to the rest of the income statement. Our gross margin rate rose to 32.1% in the third quarter, an increase of 50 basis points over last year. Similar to last quarter, the gain was driven by leverage of our relatively fixed occupancy and buyers\u2019 compensation from which we picked up 60 basis points. This was partially offset by a 10 basis point reduction in our merchandise margin rate, which was due to the softer apparel trends, IMU mix, and the higher penetration of DTC.","That brings me to SG&A, which came in at 21.3% of sales, an improvement of 10 basis points from last year. Leverage on the SG&A line reflects both disciplined expense management and strong topline performance. Depreciation expense for the third quarter was $44 million flat to last year, while interest income rose to $3 million from $2 million last year.","Our GAAP tax rate for the third quarter came in at 27% above last year's 10.8% rate, which benefited from adjustments related to U.S. tax reform. On a non-GAAP basis, our rate came in at 27.7% in line with our expectations. An important contributor to the strong performance this quarter was the continued productivity of our inventory. At quarter end, our inventory was essentially flat on both a reported and constant currency basis, while achieving the mid-single digits sales gain.","Our turns continue to improve overall and our inventory remains both fresh and productive heading into the holiday season. We ended the quarter with $744 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, a decrease of $4 million from the end of Q3 last year.","We continue to focus our capital allocation strategy around two key objectives. First, we continue to invest in the business. During the quarter, we spent $45 million on capital expenditures, bringing our year-to-date total to $126 million. For the year, we are currently tracking towards $220 million below the prior guidance of $250 million, due primarily to project timing.","Included in this capital spend are the investments in our digital and analytics capabilities, a piloting of our FLX membership program, our expansion in Asia, and our ongoing efforts to elevate the customer experience in our stores. We also made a $3 million strategic investment in network, and exciting new video ecommerce and content platform. You will hear more about network from Dick.","Looking at our Store Base. We opened 11 new stores this quarter, including three Power Stores and two new doors in Asia, bringing the total year-to-date openings to 35 stores. On the other side of the ledger, we have closed 96 stores this year, including 25 in Q3. For the full-year, we now expect to open about 70 stores, remodel or relocate 165 and close 180. As is usually the case, a large number of the store closures occur post-holiday upon lease expiry.","The second objective of our capital allocation strategy is meaningful returns of cash to our shareholders through our strong dividend and opportunistic share repurchase program. This quarter, we returned $41 million to our shareholders through our dividend of $0.38 per share.","As we have previously described, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, which means that when we see value, we maybe more active. In this quarter, we recognized opportunity and increased the pace of share repurchases, spending in total $178 million to buyback approximately 4.6 million shares. Through the first three quarters of the year, we have spent $300 million to repurchase 7.5 million shares or 6.7% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.","In total, we have returned $425 million through our quarterly dividend and share repurchase programs this year. In terms of the fourth quarter, our outlook is as follows: Comp sales relatively flat, which reflects the trends in our apparel business as well as the challenging comparison to last year's 9.7% fourth quarter comp, a gross margin rate decrease of 10 basis points to 30 basis points, and SG&A rate of flat to up 10 basis points, and mid-to-high single-digit growth in earnings per share.","As a result, we now expect our full-year comp sales to be in the low single-digit range with gross margin improvement of 10 basis points to 20 basis points, SG&A to be up 40 basis points to 50 basis points as a percent of sales, and a mid single-digit EPS gain. Depreciation is now expected to be closer to $180 million and our full-year tax rate remains at approximately 27.5%.","One last topic before I hand the call over to Dick. We've been giving thoughtful consideration to our public guidance practices. We've gathered feedback from our investors, analysts, directors, and other advisors about what is most helpful and productive. We have studied what others inside and outside our industry do. With all that information, we have concluded it is time for a change.","Starting next quarter with regard to fiscal 2020 guidance, we will shift to provide you only the annual comp sales and EPS outlook and not detailed quarterly guidance. Where appropriate, we will give you additional color to aid your overall modeling. We believe this approach is aligned with our long-term thinking, reflects how we manage the business and is consistent with current best practices.","With that, I will turn the call over to Dick.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Lauren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Throughout the year, I have been speaking with you about how our deepening connections with our customers combined with our strategic relationships with our vendor partners had us well positioned to deliver strong results.","And as Lauren described, we did just that in the third quarter. Our strong top and bottom line performance reflects some of the early benefits of implementing our long-term strategic imperatives, elevating the customer experience, investing for long-term growth, driving productivity and leveraging the power of our people.","Before I speak about our strategic initiatives, let me dive into some of the key drivers of our performance in the quarter. There were a number of areas with outstanding results. For example, a growing and diverse footwear business, engaging content and storytelling and further progress in our efforts to create physical and digital destinations where our customers can be inspired.","Looking at footwear, we delivered excellent results across men's and kids and posted solid results in women's. We were pleased to see the basketball category return to growth this quarter. A strong Jordan business led by the classic AJ1s in our exclusive Jordan Rivals Pack combined with robust demand for Air Force 1s from Nike and the Adidas Hardcourt fueled the strong gain.","Signature Basketball also had some bright spots with strong performances from Giannis and Kyrie from Nike. Our Running business again produced solid results, driven by premium lifestyle running models, including Air Max styles from Nike, YEEZY and NMD from Adidas and the Puma RS-X.","Our concept work with our strategic partners continues to deliver new energy to the marketplace. Some examples from the third quarter include our exclusive evolution of the Swoosh Collection with Nike, which was a leading concept for back-to-school.","The Jordan Rivals Pack celebrated Michael's most notable rivals across a number of colorways. We teamed up with Adidas on the Logo Distortion collection. We brought our customers the Ultra Limited, Patrick Mahomes sneaker through a nomadic experience at Arrowhead Stadium and teamed up with former Kansas City Chiefs great, Dante Hall to surprise a local underserved high school football team with the brand new AM4 Mahomes Cleats and matching travel gear.","In addition, we partnered with Puma and its bold collection and featured its collaboration with the outdoor brand Helly Hansen. The areas with the biggest challenges were the same as last quarter, Apparel and Eastbay. While the overall Apparel business remains healthy, the results were affected by a fashion shift away from select branded sportswear programs that in prior quarters had helped drive strong results in the category. On top of that, we felt the impact from our strategic move away from the private label business and tough comparisons in the licensed category.","Moving the Eastbay, the reasons for the more challenging performance are similar to last quarter, with softer results across performance footwear and apparel assortments. The current style shift in casual apparel away from windwear and nylon was also a negative. We are working to improve performance and did see some bright spots, especially in the basketball category.","Looking forward, we have an exciting lineup for this holiday season. We have the next iteration of the evolution of the Swoosh Collection from Nike. The positive trend in basketball is likely to continue with the new Kyrie 6 launch adding to the early momentum in the Signature business.","In addition, Jordan and Air Force 1s will continue to elevate and drive the culture of basketball. We're partnering with Adidas on the next update of the Logo Distortion collection and have compelling YEEZY drops coming. And there's even more heat on the way, including the new Patches program from Timberland, the Coke's Champion Collab and new models and stories from Puma, Converse and others.","Now looking at our progress in executing on our strategic initiatives, I will start with our efforts to elevate the customer experience. Let's begin with our Power Stores. On our last call, we told you about our newest community-based Power Store in New York's Washington Heights neighborhood. While still early days, the results are very promising, driven by our ability to build deeper connections with the community. We are seeing significant gains across a number of performance and customer sentiment indicators such as traffic, conversion and overall satisfaction to name a few.","Our Home Grown program, featuring local creators has been such a success at Washington Heights that we have begun to amplify it in our other Power Stores across North America. The NikePlus ShoeCase and Unlock Box have added even more connectivity and excitement, offering members access to exclusive products.","We opened two other new Power Stores this quarter bringing our exciting new offense to Melbourne, Australia and Frankfurt, Germany. These stores will serve their communities as places where people can come and be inspired, hang out with their friends, find and meet local influencers and discover exclusive and localized products.","Our new membership program FLX continues to move forward. It has been well received in our test markets, Lady Foot Locker in the U.S. and Foot Locker Netherlands. While this is the inaugural loyalty program for our European business. In the U.S., FLX is driving stronger enrollment and metrics compared to our old VIP program. Across both regions, we are seeing higher average order value and positive sentiment around the program's benefits.","I am pleased to announce that the program is now live in the UK and France and we still expect to expand the rollout in the U.S. post-holiday and across additional European countries in 2020. We are also elevating the customer experience through new enhanced brand presentations.","Foot Locker Europe has begun rolling out, Nike and Jordan consumer experiences in a group of key stores. The presentations feature enhanced walls and fixtures to deliver elevated storytelling that connected today's customers with the heritage of the classic Nike and Jordan offerings and the brand's latest innovations in our stores.","The results so far have been very encouraging, with increased customer awareness and interaction, leading to improved conversion. We are also expanding the development and rollout of enhanced women's spaces across select European and U.S. markets, where she experience is a space and product curated for her, a place to explore and be inspired. We'll also connect with her through improved digital experiences and social engagement.","By the end of this year, we expect to have around 20 elevated women's spaces across Europe, 25 in the U.S. at Foot Locker, Champs Sports and Footaction, with plans to scale to build-out next year.","At Foot Locker Australia, we are now accepting Afterpay both in-store and online, creating a more convenient shopping experience by opening our channels to those customers seeking to buy now and pay later, and this is only the beginning. Given the positive customer response, we are considering similar payment options in our other markets.","Moving on to our second strategic priority, investing in long-term growth. The third quarter featured the exciting launch of our in-house incubator Greenhouse. We created Greenhouse to develop new ideas and partnerships that are relevant to youth culture today and in the future.","The Greenhouse app highlights one product story at a time. This quarter it introduced customers to five great stories with some terrific new partners like emerging designers, Nicole McLaughlin, Christina Paik and a collaboration between Atmos, Adidas and popular media and music conglomerate 88rising at ComplexCon.","We've made a six strategic minority investment in an early-stage company, led by CEO, Aaron Levant, NTWRK is a unique platform. It brings the best brands and cultural icons together on live videos and provides our customers with the connection to shop exclusive products while they watch. It acts as a storyteller, demand creator and product validator.","We believe we can leverage our relationship with NTWRK, to introduce product, generate excitement and drive commercial success in our ecosystem. One way we plan on partnering with NTWRK is through Greenhouse. While they operate separately, many of the Greenhouse products will be sold on NTWRK through our out-of-the-Greenhouse video franchise. By leveraging both platforms we can extend the reach of Greenhouse and validate the potential of new ideas.","Turning to Asia. We continue to move forward in this important region. During the quarter, we opened up our fifth store in Singapore and our third store in Hong Kong as well as bringing online a third-party distribution center in Singapore. With this new supply chain capability up and running, we can source product directly from our vendors into the region. This provides a more efficient and cost effective way to distribute product to our stores and fulfill sales from our digital channels.","That brings us to driving productivity, our third strategic imperative. In addition to continued attention to and success in inventory management, logistics and expense management initiatives, our digital and analytics investments provide us with tools to make our business even more productive.","We've built a framework around maximizing customer lifecycle management that utilizes machine learning to harness our data in order to make us more relevant for our customers, whether that's how they engage with us or complete their purchase. For example, applying machine learning capabilities has allowed us to make the keyword search functionality on the Foot Locker U.S. and Champs Sports websites more relevant, which helps drives conversion.","Another area is personalization, where a cross-functional team from marketing, data and finance is developing and testing a platform to create and implement data-led campaigns across our channels. Initial results from these efforts show that personalization, even as simple as directing customers to their preferred store or offering them the latest release from their favorite brand or model, allows us to deliver an improved more relevant customer experience and to employ a more efficient marketing spend while driving topline results.","That brings us to our fourth imperative, leveraging the power of our people. This quarter we launched Lace Up, our new associate learning and communications platform. This new interactive training system provides us the ability to engage, educate and empower our associates. It can be accessed via mobile or on a workstation and is customized to each associates learning path.","Every shift associates can clock in, Lace Up and hit the sales floor within just a few minute. This leaves them with more time to engage with our customers and exceed their expectations. Before we continue, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to each and every associated at Foot Locker Incorporated. It is through their dedication and hard work that we were able to achieve the results we did this quarter and continue to make progress on our journey to inspire and empower youth culture.","We are ready to get the holiday season going. Yesterday, we launched our 8th Annual Week of Greatness with a number of terrific product releases and the start of our No Matter What digital campaign. The excitement will be felt across the U.S. and internationally and will continue throughout all of next week and extending into the new year.","We are optimistic about the progress we are making as a company. Our financial position remains strong and we are poised to continue advancing towards our long-term financial objectives, as we continue to build value for our shareholders. Lastly, I want to wish all of you a happy Thanksgiving, Week of Greatness, and a happy healthy holiday season.","Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question on the line is Chris Svezia of Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Christopher Svezia","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Richard Johnson","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Svezia","I guess, first, Dick, can you maybe just add a little color on the Apparel business, where you're seeing some success in women's, kind of what you're doing about it? And I know obviously kind of tempered the fourth quarter comp a little bit because of it, but just sort of the outlook and what we can expect in terms of what you guys are doing to kind of turn that segment around?","Richard Johnson","Yes, specifically on the women's, Chris, as we open more spaces where we've got the right space to showcase and tell stories in the women's apparel, we're seeing pretty good business. We're seeing her respond to the storytelling that we've got to the product that we've got in these spaces. So as I talked about we've got spaces that are dedicated in the U.S. and Europe, we'll continue to roll those out as we get into 2020. So again that's an exciting update on the women's side.","On the men's side, we've got a little bit of a shifts going on in some of the franchises that have been good for us, slowed down a little bit and as we transition into a cleaner, less all-over logo sort of look, we've got to just transition through the inventory. We also have made a strategic step away from some of our private label product, right. So that's \u2013 we're comping some fairly big numbers from last year that we need to get over to the next quarter or two.","Likewise, if you remember last year with LeBron moving to LA, there was an awful lot of excitement around the licensed products, not so much excitement with the moves this year. I think it's created a better NBA quite honestly, but not quite as much excitement as the LeBron moved last year. So as we sort of rationalized through that, we've got the product team focused on it. And I feel good about where apparel is, but there will be a little bit of a drag in this quarter.","Christopher Svezia","How does fleece \u2013 I guess that's not enough to kind of offset some of the things that you're seeing there. And just in terms of \u2013 I know you don't want to talk about next year, but you believe that some of things you're working on can maybe make this segment less of a headwind as we go for next year? Just any color about that?","Richard Johnson","Well, fleece is critical, right. As the weather changes, fleece becomes our consumers outerwear in a lot of cases. So I feel good about where we're positioned with fleece going into the fourth quarter. As we look forward to 2020, we'll certainly talk more about that when we get into our February call, but the team is connecting the great storytelling that we're doing on the footwear side, trying to get more connectivity, with the apparel pieces, the concept work that our team has done a great job on the footwear side. We're getting better at connecting the apparel with.","So again, I think it's progress, we stress here, progress over perfection. And I think the team is definitely moving that way and we're getting to be a little bit better at apparel. And I think we've got progress that we've made and we'll continue to work at it.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. Thank you. And just last two quick ones here. Just on the gross margin, Lauren, just how do we think about merchandise margin versus occupancy leverage, if you think about Q4? And Afterpay when \u2013 what are you seeing more specifically? And when do you expect that maybe to rollout in your U.S. franchises? Thanks.","Lauren Peters","So as we described for third quarter with the very strong topline comp result, we got a lot of leverage from the occupancy element, in fact, 60 bps and 10 backwards in merchandise margin as we talked about apparel. And so when you turn to fourth quarter with a relatively flat comp that puts pressure on the leverage of occupancy costs, don't really see anything different in the underlying merchandise margins.","And on that Afterpay front, yes, that's really been very interesting. We've had layaway in our format for decades. But of course, Afterpay makes that much easier digitally and in-store, so we've been pleased with the response that we've seen in Pacific and we are bringing on the capability with service providers to extend that to other geographies.","So we will begin to test that. Of course, that's just one payment option. There's all sorts of innovations on the payment front. So we will test and learn. I look more for that to be 2020.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. Thank you very much, and all the best.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","The next question comes from Cristina Fernandez of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Cristina Fernandez","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the apparel side. How do you feel about the apparel inventory? And should we expect more clearance as you have to sort of shift the assortments in that category? Thanks.","Richard Johnson","Yes, I think the merchant team has done a great job lining things up as we go into this busy season. So I think it's going to be a fairly discount-led marketplace around some of the apparel trends that are going on. So I think our team is well positioned. It certainly will fit within the parameters of the guidance that Lauren gave earlier.","So I don't see anything dramatic, but that's part of the merchandise lifecycle, is that when you're playing closer to the fashion realm, you have to move through product relatively quickly at times and our team is set up to do that going into the fourth quarter.","Cristina Fernandez","And then my follow-up on the footwear side. Can you talk about how volumes were in the quarter? And as you look into the fourth quarter, is there any change in the expectations for footwear as far as the product line-up versus your original expectations?","Richard Johnson","Well, since we gave our full-year guidance at the beginning of the year, there's always shifts, right. We've talked the last couple of quarters about launch shifts that are in and out. We've talked about how things move day-to-day but sometimes they move quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, there was an awful lot of YEEZY in fourth quarter last year, that's been pulled forward. So we got the benefit earlier in the year this year. We've got some great YEEZY launches coming, but it's just a different cadence than last year. So we see continued heat coming in the basketball category.","There is casual and lifestyle basketball driven by great AJ1 products from Jordan and Air Force 1s, the Adidas Hardcourt. We see some excitement around some of the player specific signature products. So again, I feel good about where footwear business is. There are some exceptions to last year that we just won't comp based on the calendar and based on the flow from our vendor partners. But I feel good about where we're at from a footwear perspective.","James Lance","Was there a follow-up, Ms. Fernandez?","Cristina Fernandez","Just any color on the footwear volumes in the third quarter?","Richard Johnson","Footwear volume, we don't breakout our volume by family of business, right. I mean clearly, we've talked in the comments about footwear being the driver high single-digits with really good performance across men's and kids and strong performance with women's as well.","And I can add that that was really across the geographies and the banners, right? The only, I guess, a little bit of weakness was the weakness that we talked about in performance footwear at Eastbay. But beyond that, the footwear business was consistent and strong across the geos and banners.","James Lance","Thanks, Christina.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Great. Thanks. So Dick, maybe beyond the quarterly shifts along the way that we've talked about low single-digit comps for the year, it's clearly a cut versus expectations for mid-singles three months ago, I guess what changed? And do you still view mid-single digits as the multiyear run rate for this business?","Richard Johnson","Well, what changed, Matt, is a little bit of this pressure on the apparel front that we talked about. I really assume that we would get a little bit farther ahead of it and that's taken a quarter and we'll have a little bit of headwind this quarter, some of the timing that impact fourth quarter was some launch shifts that obviously move and expectations weren't met.","Going forward, as we work with our vendor partners and as we look to continue to expand in the footwear business, identify opportunities on the apparel front, continue to grow the business across the geographies, focus on our strategic imperatives I think it probably is a mid single-digit sort of growth opportunity for us, right.","On the topline, that's where we really see the opportunity to grow. And there is a lot of things going on and we talked about the Power Stores, the work that we did up in Washington Heights, we see a lot of excitement around that. So figuring out how we can commercialize that a bit. These women's spaces are great new opportunities for us. So every time that we create an opportunity to improve the customer experience, we believe that that's going to help us drive the topline.","Our relationships with our vendor partners are leading to great concept work that again, we think, distinguishes us in the marketplace. While we take their best concepts and we work to tell great stories around them, it really is how can we differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and I think our team is doing a great job of that. So yes, I think on the topline it is probably a mid single-digit growth opportunity.","Matthew Boss","Okay. Great. And then just on the expense front. So SG&A dollars on average the last two years have grown mid-single digits. I guess maybe where do we stand on the investment bell curves as we look today? And more so how linear is the five-year SG&A leverage opportunity that you laid out at the Analyst Day, meaning do we see a step change next year to SG&A leverage? Or is the multi-year opportunity more back-end loaded as we think about that five-year opportunity?","Lauren Peters","Well, you've been tracking us along, and it sounds like you have been. You've seen the growth in the dollars moderating, right. So 2018, the growth looks like 7%, in spring it look more like 5% to 6%. Third quarter it was 3%. So I mean you can see that we are getting past the big growth spike, as we continue to invest in the business for the long-term opportunity.","As we've described, the investments have looked like tech, and we needed to do some foundational work in there. We're getting to the place where some of that foundational stuff we can help on. We've also been investing in our associates. They are a critical asset for us in our plans and so with both minimum wage and healthcare putting pressure on it that's been a bit of that, but that's all been incorporated in our guidance.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Good morning.","Richard Johnson","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Trussell","Maybe just to touch again on Matt's question around the updated comp outlook. In the third quarter, you were able to overcome some of the apparel challenges through really strong footwear trends. So maybe as we hone in on the updated kind of fourth quarter outlook for flat, knowing that you had this tough compare coming. Maybe discuss a bit more around what has changed on the footwear front, in terms of perhaps different categories that you don't expect to maybe perform at the same levels that you did previously?","Richard Johnson","Yes. Paul, I guess that I would just reference some of the timing shifts that I talked about earlier, right. You're all aware of the level of YEEZY penetration from a year ago. That's been spread out a bit. So that put a little bit more pressure when we originally put our guidance out early in the year, we didn't know the timing of all of that. As we think about the categories, we're seeing a nice pick up in basketball, that I talked about, a lot of it driven by the casual side of it, but signature basketball performing well.","I guess, some of it is that when we look at a two-year stack, we were \u2013 two years we were up really low-single digits 1.8% in the first quarter, two-year stack, 1.3% in the second quarter, 8.6% in the third quarter. We're going to stack something on top of a 9.7% from last year. So again, it's about the relativity of what you're up against some times, and we know that we're in a comp business. So we know that there is \u2013 it's our responsibility to comp those numbers.","The other piece that's a little bit of an unknown is how the calendar shift is going to impact us, right. We've got a Week of Greatness that shifts a week later. There is an extra delivery day in Christmas week. We haven't seen this calendar since 2013 and there has been an awful lot of changes since 2013.","So I feel \u2013 as I said earlier, Paul, I feel good about where our footwear business is. There's always puts and takes. We see some models and some categories slowdown a little bit. We see others accelerate. They don't always line up perfectly. But I think our putting even a little bit on a 9.7% comp over a two-year period is a great reflection on the good work that the team has done.","Paul Trussell","Thanks for that color. And then maybe if you can just touch on some of the early learnings from the FLX loyalty program, where you have that on the ladies side or in Europe? And also curious about as we think about your strategic partnerships and investments that you've made, which of those are you perhaps kind of most excited about being more of a contributor as we look over the next 12 months?","Richard Johnson","Yes. Those are two great questions, Paul, right. So the early learnings on FLX are two different books, quite honestly. In the U.S., we're seeing an uptick that we really like from the people that were part of our VIP loyalty program, the women that were part of that program at Lady Foot Locker. So they like what they see from a membership sort of belonging and the benefits that they have access to and the communication that we've got with them, right. So we've seen them be more engaged with Lady Foot Locker as a brand. We've seen them accumulate points and use them to get the benefits that are meaning to them.","So there has been a lot of good positive news there. And as we get ready to rollout FLX broader in the U.S., we've got many steps to go through. We just went through a single sign-on changeover, so that you'll be able to use one sign-on across all of our apps and digital sites, which was an imperative that we had to get through before we launched a full-blown in the U.S.","When I look at Europe, it's really the first time that they've had a loyalty membership program. So we're seeing a whole different reaction, right. The mix of men to women is a little bit different than we expected. The way that they spend their points, if you will, and redeem for benefits she is more willing to wait for something that's really exceptional for her. He wants to make sure that he spends them really quickly. So it's like a dollar sitting in this pocket that is burning a hole in this pocket.","So there are two different learnings and they are coming together nicely. We just rolled out FLX and a couple more countries in Europe, in France and in the UK. So we will have much more learning by the time we get to our fourth quarter call. As the schedule sits today, we will have just launched FLX across the U.S. So again, I think really exciting stuff on the FLX front. Our team is doing a great job and the way they're thinking about it and the connectivity that they've got with the consumer.","On the investment front, Paul, I'm excited about all of them honestly, right. It goes back to the first investment that we made with Carbon38. And Katie and the team there continue to do great work and we've got a number of others. We've done a couple of really exciting creative things with D'Wayne and the PENSOLE Group to really fuel the industry going forward with new designers.","Champ Sports just launched an event with PENSOLE. We've had a number of \u2013 our most recent investment NTWRK, we've had a number of products that have launched on NTWRK. So they all add tremendous value. I think about Eddy and Daishin at GOAT and the great work that they're doing. We're working with them to figure out how we best make the secondary market experience more relevant for our consumer.","Rachel and her team at Rockets of Awesome have had a pop up, a physical pop-up here in New York, where we've been able to have a small footwear section that was powered by Kids Foot Locker. So we see tremendous opportunity there. And Jason and the team at Super Heroic, the energy and the passion that they've got around getting kids out to play is it's infectious.","So I look at all of them and I think that they all become part of the FLX, the environment and our total ecosystem, they all bring excitement to our core brands. And I think at this point, we invest in people. We invest with people with passion and purpose, and we've got that across all of these investments. And I think as our team continues to metabolize them and think about how they can work with them, we'll continue to see more great opportunities with these six investments.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. Best of luck.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Binetti of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question here. Lauren, just one housekeeping on the model. Can you help me understand SG&A how a flat same-store sales guidance only translates to 10 basis points of SG&A in the fourth quarter? It seems like a bit of a change in the run rate there. So I just to make sure I understand it, or if you would tell me if there is any puts or takes I should think about?","Lauren Peters","Yes. Relatively flat topline, flat to 10 delever on the SG&A. So if you do the math on that, as I've already described, the growth in SG&A moderating.","Michael Binetti","Is there anything \u2013 it seems like the leverage point moves down for some reason on the spending in the fourth quarter? Is there any callouts there?","Lauren Peters","We're not ready to call leverage point anything other than mid single-digit growth in comp, but the rate of growth in SG&A moderating. So we continue to do an awful lot of work on the elements to look for opportunity to improve that. You've heard in our prepared remarks, that some of the digital things that we've done are beginning to payoff in that way we described machine learning and how that's helping us being more effective with our marketing spend. You've heard us describe Lace Up training app for our associates, which is just great learning to all, helping them deliver a better customer experience.","So these things and we've talked about others in the past, RFID, some of our automation efforts on the backside of the house. These are the things that we're working on to improve that leverage point.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Let me, I guess back up then and ask a bigger picture, Dick. I would say one would listen to the combined commentary here. You spoke to Matt's question about the mid-single digit revenue growth rate.","Lauren, you described this year as a catch-up on some investing that you felt like you needed to get in. One would tend to leave those comments thinking that the pace of the business next year against the goals you laid out in the five-year algorithm would pick up?","So I'm just \u2013 I'm wondering if I can specifically ask about 2020. Do you feel like next year, we see the pace of the business start to, obviously, you'll need to deliver some years along the next four years above the algorithm after this year, do you feel like the leverage point improves next year?","And I'm asking this in the context of consensus, looking for mid single-digit earnings growth next year versus your guidance for the long-term, at about 10%? Can you describe to me your comfort with where the consensus is now based on thinking that revenue opportunity is still mid-singles and it sounds like to leverage point should improve next year as some of the investments are in this year?","Richard Johnson","Well, we'll talk much more about our 2020 plan on our fourth quarter call, and we talked about it in our Investor Day, Michael, that the puts and takes won't be level across the five-year sort of time horizon.","The investments will be \u2013 there will be cycles of investments and then there will be a period where we get to reap some of the benefits of that, but I think we talked about it at the Investor Day as well that the investment to continue to stay relevant for our consumer is going to have to continue over time. So you're going to \u2013 I'm not ready to comment about 2020 and consensus of where you all are at, but we will certainly get into the 2020 commentary on our fourth quarter call.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot guys.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Komp of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Komp","Yes. Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to maybe follow-up on the apparel discussion to understand a little better. Dick, it sounded like maybe last quarter you expressed some optimism about apparel directionally in the second half. And I'm just curious if kind of the pace of some of the shifts you talked about have changed or the shift themselves were different than you were expecting? And I'm just trying to get a sense of any differences versus what you saw a few months ago?","Richard Johnson","The changes, Jonathan, the changes are about what we expected, the pace is a little bit different and our ability to catch-up is a little bit different than I anticipated at the time. But again, I think the team is moving in the right direction, as I mentioned to Cristina.","I think it's going to be a fairly discount-led apparel world in the fourth quarter, and our team is prepared to do what they need to do to move through the inventory, which sets us up for a 2020 sort of apparel business, but it's not significant differences, right?","There certainly are a little bit of headwinds that we thought would have dissipated a bit. But again it's \u2013 in our business, it's a hard call as to exactly when the shift is going to happen and exactly when the inventory is going to catch-up. So I mean I'm comfortable where we're at, but we know that we've got work to do on the apparel front.","Jonathan Komp","Okay. That's helpful, and then maybe just one follow-up on the outlook in the fourth quarter. I'm curious for any more color on how you formulated the guidance for the comps and part of that maybe across channels, just given the pretty extreme difference in comparison you face for stores versus the direct channel? So any more color there would be helpful.","Richard Johnson","Well, we don't guide channel-by-channel. But I think from a gut level feel, we all know how important the digital connectivity is to our consumer. When you think about the holiday season, it certainly is one of the seasons the digital experiences accelerate. So from the \u2013 what's changed from Black Friday to Black November, I guess because the deals are all out there early.","The intensity around the Cyber Monday days and the work that can be done digitally I think certainly puts pressure on everybody that sells product digitally. So I think I expect a good digital quarter. I expect good traffic in the stores. This is one of those have to buy sort of periods where we seem to be winning with our consumers. Lauren mentioned the winning with consumers during back-to-school season stepping in the holiday now is another one of those times when the consumers are out.","So we look for good business on both channels. Again, up against the 9.7% comp from a year ago. I think the team is well-positioned to win with our consumers as they are shopping for the holiday and post-holiday with all of their gift cards.","Jonathan Komp","Okay, great. That's helpful color. Thank you.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","The next question comes from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on the apparel. Is it the Retro kind of big logo, big brand name types of products that you're seeing that the customer shy away from? And if that's the case, is it move \u2013 is the aesthetic moving back towards more of a performance silhouette? Is that a possibility?","And then I also wanted to ask about the North American kind of hyper local Power Stores strategy, the community activation, the using the localization data. I think you have five that you opened last year and of course, the one in Washington Heights.","And I think from the Investor Day, you had a pretty aggressive plan over the next few years to open more of those or convert more of your locations into those Power Store formats? I would love to kind of get an update on what's going on with those and what you think the opportunities are there? Thanks.","Richard Johnson","Sure. Well, on the apparel front, Omar, it really is the bigger logos stuff that is slowing down a bit. It's going to a much cleaner sort of aesthetic on the product. I don't know that it's more performance-based, right? I mean, it's still very much casual-led, but it's a cleaner aesthetic than it has been and that's one of the shifts that's going on in the marketplace.","When it comes to the Power Store, it's clearly the one that we're learning the most for or learning the most from is Washington Heights right now. It really is community-based, but we're seeing great results continue from Detroit and Philadelphia, where we've got strong community-based Power Stores as well.","So we did talk, I think in the Investor Day, we talked about the opportunity to roll these out. We see the potential of probably 100-ish sort of communities based Power Stores over the five-year period.","We're learning from each of these and I will tell you that we learned when we move to Washington Heights about the proper spacing and sizing of our women's business, right? We had under-sized the women's business in the Detroit 8 Mile store and I think we got it right in Washington Heights. We feature women's and kids on the main level and men's in the activation zone are featured upstairs. So again, I think in each case we learn a lot, the local connectivity.","The Home Grown effort has really exploded up in Washington Heights, designers, local guys in the house that they may operate out of their garages with a very skeleton sort of crew, but they have a real connectivity with the local consumer and we've seen some of those brands really resonate and we've actually try to a couple of times to push them a little bit broader in the DMA and we're seeing some success with a couple of them as they're able to supply us products.","So each of them provides a learning opportunity. We're not going to rush the rollout, because we really believe that they have to be in the right location and we have to have the right understanding of the community. But we think it's a great opportunity to connect with our vendor partners to create unique experiences, and most importantly to connect with the local communities.","Omar Saad","That's interesting. Thanks. Have a nice holiday.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","And the last question comes from Sam Poser of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Samuel Poser","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I guess, I want to follow-up on the guidance, I mean you've mentioned Dick that, in answer to one of the other questions regarding that 9.7% comp is a difficult, the 9.7% on a stack basis a difficult comparison. Can you talk to us about what exactly sort of the magnitude of what changed and from when you gave guidance in \u2013 at the end of Q2 and today?","Richard Johnson","So the big things I've already covered off on, Sam, right? I mean the use need the timing of the YEEZYs has been different than we expected. The headwinds with apparel have been a little bit more severe than I expected. So those are really the dynamics that have changed from our earlier guidance. And again, the 9.7% has been out there, we've known that obviously.","But again, as these things shift and we've had benefit of the YEEZYs earlier in the year, as the apparel has become a little bit tougher than we expected that becomes a headwind. Eastbay on the performance side has not performed at the level that we thought that it would. So again, those are probably the biggest variables that have changed from earlier guidance.","Samuel Poser","And so you didn't know exactly how many YEEZYs or when they were going to launch when you provided the guidance at the end of Q2?","Richard Johnson","No. Sam, launches as you are well aware of, because you follow the industry really closely. Launches move both quantities and date shifts fairly dramatically at times so\u2026","Samuel Poser","From what I understand there's a launch tomorrow \u2013 there is a launch in mid-December, and there is a new one in January. So is this a pairs issue more than a number of launch issue?","Richard Johnson","It's always a combination, Sam, right? If you go back and look at the YEEZY launch calendar last year, we had more YEEZY launches. We had a YEEZY launch in November \u2013 week-one of November, a YEEZY launch in week-three of November, a YEEZY launch in week-three of November and a YEEZY launch in week-4 of November.","We had the YEEZY launch in week-two of December, right? We had the YEEZY launch in week-five of December and week-four of December. So again, it's both, its launch dates and it's always quantities that move. So we share what we know. We base our guidance on what we know.","Samuel Poser","But I mean apparently you weren't \u2013 you didn't know what you would be getting or when you would be getting it at the time. So why did after missing \u2013 after tracking to a lower than mid single-digit comp in the first half of the year? Why did you guide that if you weren't sure what you were going to get and when you were going to get it?","And what have you learned from what happened from sort of the pace of things this year as far as guidance and talking to the Street and so on? And also, are you going to narrow the range of some of these guidance because based on your guidance, it looks like your mid single-digit EPS growth again is at the very low-end of that range of mid-single-digits for the full-year? Mid single-digit EPS growth is at the very low-end of this 3.5 to 6 range?","Richard Johnson","I'm not sure what your question is, Sam, sorry, right. So what have we learned? We've learned that launches aren't comps necessarily. We've learned that \u2013 but we've known that. We expect that launches will fall within a range.","So again we share in our guidance Sam, we share with you all what our assumptions are at the time that we provide the guidance, right? Things do change in the industry. I think that you know that you've worked in the industry. You've been around the industry a long time.","Samuel Poser","But then wouldn't it be better to provide guidance based on current trends? So if you're going to trend a low single-digit comp this year, could we presume that you'll probably guide low singles for next year just as discretion would be the better part of valor given the things can change the way they did towards the back half of the year, this year?","Lauren Peters","For example, we'll give guidance on 2020 when we talk about our fourth quarter results. And I will reiterate that what we described about now it's time for us to make a change and we will be changing to annual guidance. It's the way we run the business and shifts can happen from quarter-to-quarter, as Dick has explained quite a bit of detail. We'll be providing annual guidance.","Samuel Poser","All right. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Richard Johnson","Happy Thanksgiving all.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Lance for closing remarks.","James Lance","Okay. Thank you for joining us today. Please join us again for next earnings call, which we anticipate will take place at 9:00 AM on Friday, February 28. The call will follow the release of our fourth quarter results earlier that morning.","Thanks again, and happy Thanksgiving and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you.

Maurer","Thank you, Christine. I'd like to welcome all of you to Foot Locker Inc.'s first quarter earnings conference call. This morning we reported first quarter net income of $162 million, an increase of 17% compared to last year's net income of $138 million. On a GAAP basis, this year's net income represents $1.10 per share, a 22% increase over the $0.90 per share we earned in the first quarter of 2013.","This quarter was the most profitable first quarter ever in the long history of our company. Q1 was also the most profitable of any quarter, not just a first quarter, in our history as an athletic company.","Included in these results are approximately $2 million of charges related to a trade name impairment in Ireland and additional Runners Point Group integration costs. Excluding these items on a non-GAAP basis, Foot Locker's first quarter earnings were $1.11 per share compared to the $0.91 recorded in the first quarter of 2013 after excluding certain RPG acquisition costs.","Except as noted otherwise, the figures and rates mentioned during our remarks will be based on these non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in this morning's press release.","Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will kick off our prepared remarks this morning with a detailed review of our first quarter financial results. She will then hand the ball to Dick Johnson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to provide additional product and operational insight into our results.","And finally Ken Hicks, our Chairman and CEO, will team with Dick to review the progress we are making on seizing the many near and long-term opportunities the company is executing against. And we will conclude with an opportunity for you to ask questions. Lauren?","Lauren B. Peters","Thank you, and good morning to you all. 2014 has started off quite well, as indicated by the very strong earnings John just outlined, and the 7.6% comparable sales gain we reported today. In fact, including Runners Point Group, our total sales increased 14% in the first quarter.","Breaking out our comparable sales gains by segment, our stores were up 6.4% while our direct to customer segment was up 17.2%. We noted on our previous call that February's comp gain was in the low double-digits. March comp sales were up in the low single-digits despite the negative impact of the shift of Easter into April this year, while April's gain was in the low double-digits.","Among our domestic store divisions, Kids Foot Locker was once again the sales leader in the quarter with a stellar mid-teen comp gain. Foot Locker division in the U.S. also had an excellent result, posting a high single-digit comp sales gain.","Footaction and Champs Sports posted a mid-single and low single-digit gain respectively. Lady Foot Locker came in with a low single-digit comp loss which represents a significant sequential improvement over last year, which Dick will discuss further during his remarks.","Foot Locker Europe generated a solid mid-single-digit comp gain. With only one country, Italy, not posting an overall sales gain in the quarter. In fact, several countries were up double-digits, including our Foot Locker business in Germany.","On top of that, Runners Point Group delivered a comp gain in the double-digits, although I need to remind you that RPG sales will not be included in our reported comp base until October of this year. Foot Locker Asia-Pacific continued its strong run producing a high single-digit comp gain. Foot Locker Canada posted a mid-single-digit decline.","Our 17.2% comp gain in our direct-to-customer segment was driven by our store banner.com business in which we achieved yet another gain in excess of 40%. Eastbay, still the biggest part of direct to customer was up low single digits while CCS, the smallest piece, was down mid-single-digits.","Our direct-to-customer sales were 11.3% of total sales, up almost 100 basis points from a year ago. These strong sales results yielded an equally strong result in gross margin, which improved to 34.6% of sales from 34.2% a year ago.","Consistent with the guidance on our call in March, the increase was primarily related to leveraging the fixed elements of our gross margin, producing a gain of 70 basis points. Merchandise margin was down 30 basis points due primarily to initial markup decline.","Our SG&A rate also improved to 19% of sales from 19.2%. As good as this result is, in fact, 19% is our best ever quarterly SG&A rate as an athletic company. It was negatively impacted by a couple of things.","First, excluding Runners Point Group our SG&A rate would have been 18.6%. We bought a profitable business with a full management team and infrastructure and for the most part we intend to keep that structure in place leveraging it for growth. That said, there are definitely operating synergies we're beginning to realize and which will continue to benefit us going forward.","The second factor impacting our SG&A rate this quarter was a $2 million increase in our legal reserves. As expected, depreciation expense increased to $36 million, reflecting a higher level of capital investments we've been making in the last couple of years.","The rest of the income statement, primarily interest and income taxes, came in very close to our expectations going into the quarter. We also delivered balance sheet results in line with our targets.","First, inventory increased 8.5% overall, compared to our 14% total sales increase. Excluding RPG and using constant currencies, inventory was up just over 3% compared to our comparable sales gain of 7.6%.","We also ended the quarter with just over $1 billion of cash and short-term investments, a decrease of about $100 million from the end of Q1 last year. We continued to execute our share repurchase program, acquiring approximately 1.5 million shares for $70 million and we also paid an increased dividend of $0.22 per share representing an additional $32 million.","Together, the share repurchases and dividends amounted to over $100 million of cash returned to our shareholders. We also invested approximately $500 million of capital into our business--","John A. Maurer","$50 million.","Lauren B. Peters","Thank you for that correction, John, $50 million of capital into our business to drive future growth.","During the first quarter, we opened 27 stores and closed 36.","As outlined in March the largest number of openings was in Europe and in Kids Foot Locker, while half of the closures were in Lady Foot Locker. We ended the quarter with 3,464 company-owned stores.","I would characterize the quarter as one in which we executed efficiently, both operationally and financially and delivered everything we said we would, along with some solid upside on the topline which flowed nicely to the bottom-line to produce the best quarter in our history.","It was an excellent performance by everyone on the Foot Locker team and certainly results of which we're all very proud.","Based on these results and what we can see over the rest of the year, we are reiterating the strong outlook we gave you at the beginning of the year. Quarterly mid-single-digit comparable sales gain, 30 basis points to 50 basis points of leverage gains and gross margins, 20 basis points to 30 basis points in improvement in SG&A, depreciation and amortization between $145 million and $150 million for the year, an effective tax rate of approximately 36.5% and double-digit percentage EPS gains.","Our results for the first couple of weeks in May are consistent with this outlook, with comparable sales through yesterday up mid-single-digits.","Let me now turn the call over to Dick to review the merchandising strategies that led to these strong results.","Richard A. Johnson","Thanks, Lauren, and good morning. I appreciate everyone taking the time to be with us this morning. Let's start with the families of business. Footwear was the leader in the first quarter with a gain in the low double digits. Apparel was down mid-single-digits and our accessories business was up low single-digits.","Starting with footwear, where we had a lot of our strengths, our biggest category was also our strongest, with basketball up solidly in the teens. The gains were led by Jordan and Nike Marquis player shoes.","As was the case throughout most of last year Jordan was strong across the Board. Jordan brand shoes like the True Flight, all of the retro releases, and the Player Edition shoes including Melo and CP performed well in the quarter. The three key players in Nike Marquis basketball, Lebron, KD, and Kobe also performed consistently well in our stores and online.","Basketball footwear sales were up in all of our geographies. Outside of North America, however, the running business is actually our largest category and our international running business was up well into the double-digits.","Our gains in running in Europe were led by Max Air by Nike, especially the Max 90 and Max One style; Adidas also stepped up with the strong program, the ZX Flux that contributed significantly to our success in the category in Europe.","Across our total company, running was up high single-digits with the international gains partially offset by a low single-digit decline in the U.S. Overall, Nike lightweight running was strong with the Free continuing to provide meaningful growth as was the Fingertrap Max where we had a good assortment of exclusive products. Some of the other technical brands trended off, although Under Armour Speedform Apollo shoe got off to a good start albeit with limited pairs thus far.","Also on the positive side, we're taking a strong position of Puma, as they begin to draw inspiration for their new innovative products from their performance sports heritage. We've introduced Puma Lab bays in about 100 of our U.S. Foot Locker stores and so far they are performing well.","Within our casual business, styles such as the Huarache, Roshe and Thea, all from Nike also performed well. Vans did well, especially in the classic silhouettes.","We also had good business in core White\/White Air Force Ones. And while Converse was down for us in total the basic white and black Chuck Taylors continue to sell well.","Turning to our apparel business, I mentioned we were down mid-single-digits in total. The competitive environment in the malls and online remains challenging and yet we did hold nearly flat from the U.S.","The premium tees, tanks, fleece and shorts that hook to our footwear did well, especially, in Jordan and Nike signature basketball. Our remodeled stores showcase this apparel particularly well and apparel sales were up in these stores.","Our biggest challenge in apparel was in Europe where the business declined double-digits. We had some successes, such as in Jordan and NBA license tees and shorts, but not enough to offset a decline in the Adidas originals product. Nonetheless, we're optimistic about the Adidas business for the back half of the year as we see a more innovative pipeline of product arriving during that period.","Finally, the weather was quite a bit warmer in most of Europe this quarter compared to last year. While that probably helped our running business it hurt our fleece business which was particularly strong a year ago.","Our sock business continues to drive the accessories category. Although, the growth is not as strong as it has been. In performance styles, growth is coming mostly from fashion socks with sublimated prints and other fun styles from vendors such as Stamps.","We also continue to be a key destination for multi-pack basic socks from our major vendors as well as our own private label socks.","Head wear was strong especially knit hats, including the licensed hats with fresh team logos and prints. These knot hats sold well not just in cold weather markets and like Timberland boots, knit hats were a popular style choice around the country, north and south throughout the quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, let me touch briefly on some of our operational metrics. First, our traffic was up in the quarter, as were units sold. Our marketing teams did a terrific job bringing customers to our stores and our operation teams were at the top of their game making sure those customers were happy and left with a bag full of merchandise.","We also posted an increase in average unit retail which was a combination of customer preference for premium product and the lower mark down rate that Lauren mentioned.","Let me now hand it off to Ken to review where we are in the execution of the initiatives addressing our many opportunities.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Dick. Good morning to you all. Let me start off by echoing Lauren's remarks that this quarter's results are something everyone at Foot Locker should be very proud of. We produced our 17th consecutive quarter of comparable sales gains and profit increases.","We achieved our third consecutive first quarter of all-time record profits and John tells me, he went back and reviewed every annual report for the last 100 years to be sure we've never earned more than $162 million of net income in a first quarter and we're strong in almost every region and division.","It took every person in the company performing their job well, displaying energy and passion and the pursuit of our goals and adhering to our core values in order to produce the results we did this quarter. I want to thank all of them for their hard work that went into this performance.","I'll now highlight some of the initiatives that are generating our current success and which we believe can lead to even better results in the future. You've heard about many of these opportunities before, but I believe they're worth reiterating.","First, our children's business is growing rapidly. Lauren mentioned the mid-teen comparable sales gain at Kids Foot Locker. Including the children's sales and other banners, the overall gain in children's was in the very high teens, as we invest successfully in the kids business in most of our other banners as well.","That said, we have further opportunities both domestically and overseas to capture more sales of merchandise for children.","We'll be opening new Kids Foot Locker stores in certain markets and dedicating more space to the children's business and many of our other banners.","Second, sales are growing in Europe. Not only is our base Foot Locker business improving in most countries, we're increasing our store count in markets where we're relatively under penetrated.","For example, we opened six stores in France in the first quarter. We also had high expectations for the Runners Point Group and so far we've not been disappointed. They've gotten off to a terrific start this year.","We're still in the process of more clearly differentiating the assortments in our unique banners, that effort has been going very well as you can see from a strong double-digit comp gain Lauren mentioned.","And finally in terms of Europe, our digital business is growing rapidly. This applies to both our legacy Foot Locker business throughout much of Europe as well as to RPG solid online positioning in Germany.","Our base is still small compared to the U.S., so we're working hard to build our capabilities and ultimately make digital in Europe another one of our real strengths.","Our third near-term opportunity is elevating our running in apparel businesses. It touched down our current results, let me just add we're very optimistic that we're taking the right steps to build the best assortment of Running footwear for our customers with exciting new products from Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, New Balance, ASICS, Brooks and Puma, either in our stores now or coming this summer.","While our strength in basketball was undeniable, we intend to ensure that we have multiple solid legs on our stool including running and casual foot wear as well as apparel.","Well our apparel penetration continued to edge back in the first quarter. We're confident in our ability to build that business overtime up to the 30% level that was in the past. We're seeing positive results from the actions we're taking to focus on premium apparel, often exclusive to us, that complements our exciting footwear offerings. We still have many stores to remodel which will allow us to showcase and sell even more apparel in the future.","However, it's an ongoing process to build the right mix of performance in basic apparel now given that the majority of our stores at this point are not yet remodeled.","Fourth, we're in various stages of rolling-out, prototyping and casting our various shopping - shop concepts in a partnership with our vendors. The concept furthest along in rollout is of course our House of Hoops shops of which we operated 139 at the end of the quarter.","We plan to take it to 200 shops very soon and once we get there, we'll see how much further we can go with this very productive concept.","We're also testing the Nike Yardlines in Champs Sports in several locations. A handful of Adi collective shops in Footaction, a prototype Jordan Flight 23 shop also in Footaction. The Fly Zone in Kids Foot Locker and we have two Puma performance labs in Footlocker.","Some of these tests are too early to call, but we'll make adjustments in order to maximize the profit potential and we're optimistic about all of them at this point.","Fifth and finally in terms of near-term opportunities, we continue to integrate our brick-and-motor operations with our e-commerce capabilities. We announced our most recent innovation just this week, the Eastbay performance zone at Champs Sports.","This is a very exciting opportunity for us and for our customers because we are bringing the full power of the Eastbay brand into the mall for the first time.","The Eastbay performance zone is a 150 square foot area inside select Champs Sports with a premium league product for what Eastbay is known will be featured. There will be an extensive array of this product available to sample and buy in the stores and a four foot touch screen will highlight size and color extensions of the even more of Eastbay's best products.","The in-store merchandize will be seasonally relevant rotating through a variety of sports and activities. And the customer will have access to the entire inventory of literally hundreds of thousands of SKUs of each day on a computer located in the zone.","This collaboration between Eastbay and Champs Sports is another great example of the creativity of our teams as we drive the evolution of the store experience to be integrated with our industry leading digital capabilities.","The first four Eastbay performance on shops will open in Champs Sports next month. We'll have one each in St. Petersburg Florida, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Sacramento.","Now let me turn it back to Dick to discuss our progress on some of our intermediate and longer term opportunities. Dick?","Richard A. Johnson","Thanks Ken. Our biggest incremental capital commitment both during the last few years and going forward is our store remodel program. We continue to roll-out the Tyrone format at Champs Sports and the Willowbrook format at Foot Locker.","We're on track to have remodeled 20% of the Foot Locker stores in the U.S. and 30% of the Champs Sports stores by the end of 2014. We're still in test mode for the new remodel format for Footaction. Yearly leagues there are also encouraging. So, we will be expanding that past this year.","We're getting better and better at executing these remodel projects and the Willowbrook format is proving successful internationally. So, we believe we have a long runway ahead of us.","Cumulatively, the remodel program is already producing good net sales reps even factoring in the time when stores are closed for construction.","We believe the momentum of improved sales will get even stronger as we complete more remodel projects during next several quarters.","Next, our investment and technology is also continuing. Our labor scheduling system is in place in North America and Europe and our teams in the field already love it.","We expect our store managers to learn to use the tool even more effectively in the years ahead. Meanwhile, our hiring tool has been implemented with great success throughout the U.S and we're currently evaluating the 2015 rollout in Europe.","We're already seeing the benefits of both of these tools and the sales productivity of our associates in our expense results.","We're in the final stages of preparing our new merchandise allocation system for a rollout beginning in the fall of this year. We're testing the system carefully. We expect this to be a very powerful tool in the hands of our merchants as we seek to lower markdowns and improve sales further by delivering the right product to right stores at the right time in the right quantities and sizes.","We are also investing in other ways to make our inventory more productive. For example, we're providing our store associates with tools such as handheld devices and digital displays, to serve their customers better even when the product they want isn't in a particular store.","We found we can't take a one size fits all approach. Technology is changing quickly. We have stores for different size and staff and challenges. But we're constantly looking for ways to help our associates to satisfy their customers and invest aggressively when the returns justify.","Finally, our women's banners are improving with a positive low single-digit comp in April and so far this month. But the business is not yet where we want it to be. The Lady Foot Locker, the Bridgewater remodel changes we talked about last time, which include an enhanced footwear wall and pant helping to improve are helping to improve the base per chain.","We have quite a few more of these Bridgewater projects to complete this spring in summer. Meanwhile, SIX:02 continues to do well. But we are still in the test mode. We've opened helping to improve stores in the Dallas area, and in Florida and we're working to build the brand awareness quickly in those local markets.","We're also testing different assortment mixes to ensure that the productivity formula for SIX:02 is optimal prior to making a roll-out decision later this year. Ken?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Dick. Before we get to your questions, let me just summarize the quarter by saying that during our call in March, we laid out some challenging expectations for 2014. And we executed consistently in the first quarter to meet and in fact exceed those expectations.","And I know from experience, that not every quarter will be a strong as the past one, but the message I want to leave you with is that this performance is not the result of floating down a stream and letting the currents dictate our results by chance.","On the contrary, our entire team is highly focused on our financial and operational objectives and actively driving our business to achieve those objectives.","There will be headwinds on the course ahead I\u2019m sure, but at the same time, we have every confidence and ability of the team at Foot Locker to respond quickly to those challenges, make adjustments and continue to move forwards towards (audio gap).","We\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Could you go ahead, Christine?","Question-and-Answer-Session","Operator","Thank you. We will not begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Our first question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks and congrats guys on a great quarter.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Seth.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse","Just follow-up on the women\u2019s business, the low single-digit improvement you\u2019re seeing in April or you start in April and then so far this month, anything specific that you can point to that striving that. Do you feel like it\u2019s a little bit of weather or anything else that\u2019s maybe changed in the business?","And then maybe more broadly the improvement that you\u2019re seeing in some of the women\u2019s remodels or prototypes that you have, is that both in footwear and apparel, any areas that maybe working better than others, just more color would be great?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, Seth. We\u2019re seeing an improvement, because I think we\u2019re getting the assortment to work more right there, focused on at mid-20 to 30-year old woman and performance oriented. And we also to some degree are anniversaring out of some of the things that we did in the past promotional elements.","Hence, we are seeing a good performance in the -- that performance apparel as we get more of it right in the stores. We all saw the performance shoes are doing well. So, we think now we\u2019ve got the assortment right. We\u2019re fine tuning it in the stores. We also have more stores that have more apparel in them, and we know that apparel is an important part of that what that customers looking for as she puts here outfits together.","So, I would say it\u2019s not just one thing, but getting a lot of work that we\u2019ve done over the past year and a half since we opened our first SIX:02 and started to updated the Lady Foot Locker stores and we\u2019re starting to see the benefits of that.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse","And the stores certainly look better, but do you feel like the awareness of those changes where it needs to be or is that an opportunity just to kind of let that shopper know that things are looking a lot better in the store that they should come back?","Kenneth C. Hicks","It\u2019s a definite opportunity. It's one of the reasons why as Dick mentioned, we\u2019re clustering some of those stores and markets, so that we get more awareness and help ourselves there. We are actually doing better in the ladies, because they\u2019ve got to built-in customer base when we start to put the apparel in. But I think ultimately, we know the customer when she gets into SIX:02, she like SIX:02, we just have to get more people to become aware of it.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse","Sure. Okay. Thanks.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Seth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity","Thanks and nice job in the quarter, guys.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Camilo.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity","I was hoping, you could talk a little bit more about the relative performance of apparel in the remodel stores versus the base, and maybe help us understand the magnitude of improvement in those remodeled store, so we can see a pathway towards you ultimately getting to that 30% mix contribution?","Richard A. Johnson","As we said, this is Dick, Camilo. As I\u2019ve said in the remarks, I mean, we\u2019re certainly seeing apparel performed better in our remodeled stores. We can tell our merchandizing stories. We got better adjacencies with the footwear and we see a pickup. We\u2019re not going to get into the specifics of the amount of the pickup, just to tell you that it is better.","We\u2019ll have 20% of the Foot Locker stores remodeled by the end of the year and 30% of the Champs stores remodeled by the end of the year. So we anticipate continuing to see progress.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity","Is it fair to say that it\u2019s\u2026?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Let me just one other thing, well it's not the only factor, but one of the things -- we\u2019re pretty well through remodeling the children\u2019s chain, and we feel pretty good about the performance in children\u2019s. And so, while we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get the same big impact in kids. We know that our current remodels in Champs and Foot Locker are meeting their expectations and our capital goals.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity","Okay, great. And then just shifting over to the quarter to-date trends that you said mid-single-digit thus far, is there any difference in the number of launches in this period if quarter to-date versus last year, because I think that there are eight new launches from Nike over the next few days that would seemingly have a pretty big impact on that quarter to-date number that were reported few days later?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, we\u2019ve got -- when we look at the launch calendars coming over, whether they line ups specifically on the day or the weekend is not always the case, but throughout the quarter they are relatively equal. So, the quarter to-date number was certainly be impacted by the line that launches on Saturday, but that just an offset to a different launch a year ago.","So, I think that again, the second quarter doesn\u2019t have quite as many exciting events whether it\u2019s a February with the All-Star game and a chance to drive or Spring Breaks or whatever it is. So, I think the mid-single-digit put long reference to our in line with our expectation.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity","Okay. And just a housekeeping question for Lauren, what was the dollar contribution from RBG in the quarter?","Lauren B. Peters","We don't disclose the results of the segments individually. But it was positive to the quarter.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity","All right. Okay. Thanks. Good luck for the rest of the year.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Kate McShane - Citi Research","Thanks, good morning. With regards to the merchandize margin pressure, I know that this has been an ongoing thing, can you remind us again where the pressure is coming from, is it more footwear or apparel and what your outlook is for this sort of for the rest of the year.","And well, I know you\u2019re being successful of offsetting some of these margin pressure from the control of inventory and the limited markdowns, are there any kinds of changes to mix that can help, alleviate some of the merchandizing margin pressure?","Lauren B. Peters","Let start with what we saw in Q1, because mix was faster. So, we back off 30 basis points in merchandize margins and more of that was related to -- I am new which was not a case of the costs to up-selling, it was more case of the vendor. So IMU is not equal across all vendors. So as vendor mix shift that hasn\u2019t impact.","The other element to the quarter, our merchandized margin with a strong result in direct-to-customer segment, which does have a bit of a lower merchandize margins, but very comparable finished margins plus fixed costs, so that\u2019s what happened in Q1. But as we look forward, we expect to get strong leverage on the fixed, which gives us 30 to 50 basis points opportunity we outlined.","And there are numbers of things that we\u2019re working on that we believe in the long-term we\u2019ll improve the merchandize margins. So things like that allocation tool that comes on line for in the fall, will help us to do better job of the right and getting place -- right product at right place, right time etcetera, etcetera.","So that will help us on the top line, but it's also going to help us on the margin, because this should impact our fewer markdowns. And then as we work on apparel, that\u2019s another opportunity as we get up to back to the 30% penetration that we think we can achieve, and ultimately get to merchandize margin rates on apparels that are other than footwear, should be the case.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We also have then apparel, the opportunity to start to rebuild lot of brands and we\u2019re starting to see that as we\u2019ve shifted from cotton by the pound to more appropriate product for the assortment we\u2019ve had. And as we get that business moving forward, that will also help our margins.","Kate McShane - Citi Research","And if I could just follow-up to one thing that you said with regards to the new systems and implementations that come on in the fall, will that be an immediate impact to margins or we see that as soon as the new systems are implemented?","Lauren B. Peters","That something that we will build over time, right, so its intention how to get the right product to the right place. It will give you a little bit of insight immediately to stuff that you haven't sent out to a store yet where you might make adjustments but where it gives you your real power is you start to influence orders.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Most systems today, it\u2019s a learning systems, so it will learn as we allocate stores and see selling patterns etcetera, the system will start to track that history. So -- while there would be some immediate impact is more I\u2019ll talk about, that will certainly grow over time as the system learns and sees our selling patterns.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, as we get every quarter using that.","Kenneth C. Hicks","And we put more categories on because it\u2019s going to be rolled out by category.","Kate McShane - Citi Research","Okay, great. And if I could snick in more questions on kids, I think you said you\u2019re expanding some of the kids business within the other brand banners, is this something that would be completed by back-to-school or will this be ongoing?","Kenneth C. Hicks","That\u2019s an ongoing effort. As we evaluate the loss space in the sales productivity, we will identify opportunities to expand in that various across banner and across geography. So, KFL certainly our strongest, we continue to open doors and KFL will see some progress, some expand of space back-to-school, but it\u2019s an ongoing effort.","Kate McShane - Citi Research","Okay. Thank you.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitchel Kummetz from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird","Thank you. Let me ask about kids, how is that business performing in Europe and what are the opportunities to kind of build the kids business there?","Richard A. Johnson","It's -- as we talked about, kids has a great opportunity in all geographies with actually our opening and testing in Kids Foot Lockers in various countries in Western Europe where we do business already. So it continues to become a bigger part of the mix in Europe and we think that there are opportunities to potentially have a more complete chain of kids Foot Lockers in Western Europe.","Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird","And it has the performance of the kids business within the Foot Lockers stores is there been a strong as what you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. or?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes.","Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird","Okay. And then on the running business, I think you guys said that international is up low double-digit, U.S. down mid-singles, what\u2019s the reason for that big difference, I mean, is it somewhat weather-related or is it from fashion standpoint or why the big difference there?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, outside of the U.S. the running silhouette is the preferred silhouette for our key consumers. So, in the U.S. basketball silhouettes and if you take a look at some of the basketball silhouettes today, the low tops, the Venomenon, some of the KD product, they are not distinctly different than a running silhouette.","They are not distinctly different than the running silhouette, I mean, obviously their performance basketball shoes, but if they\u2019re on quote they\u2019re able to be warned in many circumstances. So I think the difference is really that across the globe running is silhouette of preference and the U.S. basketball just as very significantly and very strong.","Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird","Okay. And then you said that pretty encouraged that with new running product in the pipeline, maybe this is my interpretation, but it sounds like you guys that business could get better as we go into the back half of the year, is that the case and if that is when do you think the new product will have an impact on the running business in the U.S?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, we see a good product in the pipeline across a lot of categories, but certainly in running and then the ZX Flux that I mentioned over in Europe. Some of the three nets that we\u2019ve seen hit in U.S. we\u2019ll continue to add to quantities that we\u2019ve got available. So, we expect going into the summer and back-to-school that we\u2019ll see more running product available and strong powerful sales from that product.","Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Good luck.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Mitchel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Hi, Sam.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Hi. Couple of things, one, can you give us some idea of a differential between European and domestic margins. Right now I don't need the specifics but I mean to say, what kind of base point differential are we seeing and can that evolve into something different overtime?","Lauren B. Peters","","Yeah, again we don't disclose by banners. There is opportunity in Europe, in our international businesses. They have been historically less commercial which supports very strong product margins but as we have improved the productivity in the U.S. we're seeing the gap grow.","So we think that there is upside still to the international margins.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Thank you. And then, what is the - what's the long-term store growth targets now for both Europe and for RPG, and what are we seeing there for - how you're looking at the longer term store base opportunity there?","Richard A. Johnson","We think there is still opportunities to open stores Sam, but the reality is that when we remodel and do things adding House of Hoops, adding Yardlines, we're actually increasing our square footage.","So, we're driving productivity, we're increasing our square footage as we begin to segment and differentiate the Runners Point stores and Runners Point Foot Locker and Sidestep in Germany and we get that formula right, we think there will be the opportunity as we've said in previous calls to Runners Point and test Runners Point and Sidestep outside of Germany.","So, we've said that we believe across Europe there is an opportunity more than 700, 750 Foot Locker's and that could be Foot Locker's, Kid Foot Locker's in Europe there are under penetrated markets such as France, markets that we are just getting into such as Turkey. But we think there is an opportunity for Foot Locker.","We also believe that Runners Point Group provides an opportunity in other parts of Europe and whether that's a Runners Point or Sidestep store, we are in the process of determining and we have not really made up - developed a point of view as to where and how big that will be but when we bought the chain, we said this is more than just a Germany business.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Thank you. And then lastly are you seeing - you commented Dick that the launches were pretty equal year-over-year. Are you seeing, - what kind of increases and allocations are you seeing on the marquee products either Jordon or Nike marquee?","Richard A. Johnson","Sam, we don't really discuss the level of allocation. I mean that's an ongoing discussion and opportunity with our suppliers. So, - ","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Have you seek to drive like your good comps for the quarter and your good comps quarter to-date. I mean how much of that was driven by having great product and how much of it is was being driven by having more grade products--","Kenneth C. Hicks","We have a lot of great products that is both release and non-release related. We're not going to impact with our allocations for release products there.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Well, thank you very much, and continued success.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley","","Hi, good morning.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Good morning, Jay.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley","I just want to ask about buybacks. $70 million of buybacks in the quarter was the highest first quarter in the company's history. Are you looking to continue to maintain that level through the rest of the year? And can we continue to see buybacks increase as the cash flows allows it even into 2015 and beyond?","Lauren B. Peters","","We announced at the beginning of the last year $600 billion of program in five quarter and have spent 300 of that, we got half of it locked by that math you can see that the pace is up.","","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That sounds great. And then let me just ask in a quick e-com question. I think you said DTC was up 17.2. There has been obviously e-commerce growing much faster than stores. Can you talk about when you see the DTC growth maybe normalizing because fairly a shift from stores to online, but is there a point where you see that growth rate slowing or did you see a continuous shift from stores into online?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I think that e-commerce will continue to grow faster than brick-and-mortar for some time. It's a much smaller number. Even as fast as it's growing, it's still just a fraction of what all the brick-and-mortar is.","That said, what we are doing is rather than, particularly the more developed e-commerce market, the United States, we are not adding stores, we are making our stores more exciting places to draw people and we think that's benefiting us.","So, our square footage is up but the number of stores are down and our focus is connecting the online and the store because we're seeing the customer, particularly our customer is somewhat agnostic as to where and how they buy and they go back and forth between stores and e-commerce to shop online in the store, they will shop at home, and then come to a store, all sorts of different ways.","And we're very excited about the concept that we're putting in between Champs and Eastbay, because that ultimately connects and makes our virtual store a real store for the customer. And it takes a real store and helps give it a much more virtual capability.","And I think ultimately this is where retail will go and it'll be a combination and it's one of the reasons why retailers include .com in their store for store number because it's the bigger store. It is a store and it is connected to all of the stores.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thanks so much.","Kenneth C. Hicks","So, we got that commercial element.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley","Thanks.","Kenneth C. Hicks","All right, thanks Jay.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. So, as we think about sales productivity longer term, what do you guys see the greatest opportunity as we're approaching that $500 target?","Richard A. Johnson","The single greatest would be really difficult to say, I think that we see as we had tools as we give the merchandise mix right in the store, as we had training for our associates. Those all drive productivities.","So, whether that's in a singular banner or singular geography, I think we've got tremendous productivity opportunities across the board.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","So, we shouldn't think about $500 as a sealing by any means, just more of a goal.","Richard A. Johnson","$500 is the goal. What we have done in the past and probably will do in the future is set goals to hit and then move beyond them. People do always talk about retail as a marathon and I say no, a marathon has an end. Retail does not have an end. We just keep going.","And so we have one goal, we go past another and it's indicative by the results of this quarter when you think about it, our company has a history of over 100 years and this was the best quarter in over 100 years.","By the way, next first quarter next year, want to see that again, and the next first quarter and the next first quarter. That's what we're working towards.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Great. And then as we think about the SG&A line, so excluding RPG and the legal reserve, looks like leverage is almost 75 basis points. As we think going forward, should we think about our low single-digit fixed cost hurdles that you can hold that over time, is that kind of the best way to think about the expenses?","Lauren B. Peters","We can lever with single digits content. Again think about the guidance we gave you 20 to 30 basis points on the single-digit comp gain.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Great. Best of luck.","Richard A. Johnson","Okay. Thank you.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Hey good morning, I share my congrats on a great first quarter and for good month to date results ahead of a blockbuster Memorial Day weekend headlines - all of my questions have been asked. So, I'll pass the mic.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Paul. Appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Roby Ohmes from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Actually it's -- Ken I wanted to ask you guys commented already on the share repurchase, but could you remind us, I mean you have $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Can you remind us priorities you see for that cash? And maybe weave in there your appetite for more acquisitions, especially in Europe? Thanks.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay, sure, Robbie. Our priorities remain the same, first and foremost, to make sure that we have a solid financial base for the company. We're in an industry that has up and downs and we need to make sure that we're positioned securely. And there are companies right now that aren't -- they don't have the financial strength and they're in trouble, we don't want to get in that position.","Two, to grow and take advantage of the opportunities, so we can continue to deliver the results. We're doing that with remodels, with systems and with different things to improve our business where appropriate.","The third is to make sure we recognize and reward our shareowners. We have a very viable dividend program and an active share buyback program that we've talked about.","We look and evaluate opportunities to grow the company externally on an ongoing basis. We look at a lot of different things all the time and when we see one that is appropriate, we will take action.","In Europe, we've had a couple over the last couple years. One that was a very small acquisition in the Czech Republic that allowed us to get in there, position ourselves with eight stores and make sure that we started on the right foot in that market.","Another was the Runners Point Group, a much more significant acquisition that we feel positions us: one, in the biggest country in Europe, much better. Two, gives us some other formats that we can develop in Europe. And three, a dot com capability.","If we can find things that will enhance the company like those two acquisitions in Europe, we will take advantage of them. But as I say all the time, we've got good open to listen, but we're not going to -- we don't have the money burning a hole in our pocket that we've got to go do something that's not very smart. ","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Got it and I just have a quick follow-up question for Dick. Dick, I think you mentioned in the comments something about the competitive environment in apparel in the malls and on the internet. And could you -- I was hoping you could maybe just elaborate what you were referring to. Thanks.","Richard A. Johnson","I think, Robbie, if you look at the nature of some of the vertical fast fashion people, our kid shops a lot of different places and the big verticals and the fast fashion guys make it difficult to necessarily compete on some of the fundamental basics.","So, as we target more premium athletic hook up apparel, we just have to learn to react quicker. I think that the kid has a lot of options; both online and in the mall and we have to create reasons for them to come and shop for apparel from us.","Kenneth C. Hicks","It's the reason we got out of like the cheap T-shirts, the promotional T-shirts. We were not making it a major part of our business. There's too many choices. And then when you take even a printed T-shirt now and you've got some of the vertical people who are selling their name T-shirts that used to sell for very high prices at big discounts that makes it more challenging for us to sell $20 and $25 T-shirts.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group","Good morning everyone. Congratulations as well.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Chris.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group","Just quick -- just first question -- just on Europe. Just impressive to continue to see the momentum there. I know the apparel business was tough. I guess just give us your thoughts about sustainability of that comp performance. Just kind of how you see things potentially unfolding as the year progresses, maybe some catalysts around the European business will be helpful.","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, I think Chris that we've got some momentum and traction there, as we continue with our strong kids business, as we look at the remodels and the Willowbrooks that we're putting in play where apparel will be again able to be featured more, as we get the apparel assortment right. We think that what we're doing in Europe, we're doing a lot of the right things. So, we think that the traction we've seen is sustainable.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yeah, we've also, Chris, seen an expansion of what we're doing in running, Dick talked about the ZX and Frees and things like that that have a better position in running. And basketball is actually developing as a business in Europe and we're positioned as the leading basketball person. So, you take the kids business, getting the apparel business on track the way we want and we're both the big elements in footwear, feel pretty good about Europe.","Lauren B. Peters","And our growth in digital.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yeah.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay, all right that's good to hear. And then just on the apparel business, it's nice to see some improvement in the remodels. I know Europe has been a little tough, but I think previously you had thought possibly apparel could be a comp business this year. Is that potentially still the case or is there still -- you just kind of feel there's more work that needs to be done there before you can claim victory there on the apparel business?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I don't know if we had said in the past about claiming victory in apparel. We believe that we've got some things that will help us improve our apparel business. And--","Lauren B. Peters","One of those being the remodels.","Kenneth C. Hicks","The remodels are one of them. The growth quite frankly in children's and women's helped because we didn't have an apparel business in kids and now we've got an apparel business in kids.","Women's apparel is a bigger part of their business than other businesses. And so we think that and our vendors efforts on apparel, they are having some of the same challenges and they're making some new product and things that I think will help us in apparel.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay, all right. Well, all the best, talk to you soon. Thank you.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Omar Saad from ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Thanks. Really nice execution, guys, congratulations.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thank you, Omar.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","It's also nice not to have a golf business I'm sure, at least a meaningful one. Two quick questions. Number one, it was interesting to hear you mention Puma earlier in the call. It's really been several years since that brand had a significant seat at the table back when the low profile trend was big. Any thoughts there what's happening with that brand? Is low profile coming back or is Puma evolving its brand in a way that's more relevant to your customer?","And then just also just another follow-up on Europe. I look at the huge, the really strong balance sheet situation, the cash on the balance sheet. Europe is a market where there really isn't a pan-European competitor that's relevant. And even allows a local market competitors are competitors. Why not get more aggressive there with store openings really to fill in that marketplace given how much white space there is? Is that something you'd consider doing, pushing the accelerator in Europe? Thanks.","Richard A. Johnson","Well, we obviously invested in RPG. I'll answer your second question first. We obviously invested in RPG, which gave us almost 200 more doors in Germany which, strongest economy in Western Europe. Over the last five years I think we've opened 160, 150 or 160 Foot Locker -- Kids Foot Locker doors. So, we've had a pretty aggressive program in Western Europe.","And we've got -- when we talked about the use of capitals, our remodel program is a big program. So, again part of it is having all of the geographies, all of the banners that we have to make progress in and weighing those -- we love all of our children, we just sometimes we can't love them equally, but they all get a slice of capital. So, we think that there's certainly opportunity in Western Europe.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yeah. And another thing that we're doing in Western Europe is the development of the internet which will help that business and also cover some of the territories. Your first question, we are a house of brands and we work very hard to make sure that those leading brands are positioned well. We've got a terrific partner in Nike and working with them on some franchises.","We've got a terrific party in Jordan working with them on franchises. We've got a terrific partner in Adidas working with them and other brands, Converse you go into our Kids store; we have a place where Converse is set up. We've got some places with Under Armour that we're working on.","Puma is a brand that has fallen on hard times. We think that it has potential, whether our timing is perfect, I don't know. But I believe in the Management team that Puma has now and I believe that they will come back and that it will be a good opportunity for both of us.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Thanks, Ken great job.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. Thanks, Omar.","John A. Maurer","All right, I think we have time for just one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Hey good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter guys.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thank you.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","May be Lauren, just one modeling question quickly. The spread of total revenue growth versus comp growth, it was pretty wide versus flat to negative in the past few quarters. Could you help us think about that for the model and how is that going to continue going forward?","Lauren B. Peters","Yeah, that big gap is the addition of the Runners Point Group business which came in to us in July, so we'll have that delta there for May and June and then we begin to cycle against that.","Kenneth C. Hicks","And like we've said spring is their biggest season, so this was a bigger sales lift than the fall seasons were.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay, thanks. And then Ken, just as we think about everything we've talked about over the years since you got to the company and I think women's and Lady Foot Locker have been one of the areas that's been slower to turn than you thought. We've seen obviously the department stores at the end of the mall are piling into a lot more square footage allocated to women's, obviously the off mall guys struggle with getting their percent of mix to women up higher.","Do you feel like as with the end of the mall and the anchors getting much more aggressive in that category, there's maybe a window of opportunity that's closing for you guys? Or do you feel any need to, I guess, speed up the approach to try and get Lady Foot Locker turned around and get 602 rolled out or anything like that?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we -- I believe that women's business is still the biggest opportunity. I never -- believe me; I knew it would be a challenge. There have been a lot of reasons why, part of it is some legacy and things that we have, part of it is as the brands develop their capability.","One of the things that I firmly believe is as the general merchandisers start to step something up, that presents an even better opportunity for the specialists. So, we're working to make sure we have it right and I think we're getting much closer to that.","And we will be able to step out and offer something that nobody else can, a place for a woman to shop, to buy her shoes and apparel, to be physically active and look good, and find different brands and fits to best satisfy her needs.","And that's really what we're looking at, where we're going, and I don't think a department store can do that. I don't think a sporting goods store can do that. The space is not conducive to giving her that opportunity.","And because we are a house of brands and we offer those things, I firmly believe that we are fast approaching -- or the window is not closing and we're fast approaching where we have a good answer.","We will be thoughtful in how we do it and people can be critical of being maybe a little bit slow, but I think that over the past 17 quarters, the results show being a little bit slow ain't always bad.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","For sure. And I didn't mean to sound like--","Kenneth C. Hicks","It's hard to deliver.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Thanks guys.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. Thanks, Michael. And thanks everybody for the call.","John A. Maurer","That's all we have time for today. We look forward to having you join us on our next call that we anticipate will take place at 9:00 A.M. on Friday, August 22nd following the release of our second quarter and year-to-date earnings results earlier that morning.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call to John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John Maurer ","Thanks, and welcome everyone to Foot Locker, Inc.'s earnings conference call for the first quarter of 2017. As reported in this morning's press release, the company posted a comparable sales gain of $0.5% and achieved net income of a $180 million in the first quarter compared to a $191 million of earnings in the first quarter last year. On a per share basis, we earned $1.36 this quarter, just below last year\u2019s all-time record of a $1.39 per share.","We\u2019ll start our prepared remarks today with Ric Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer who will review the key factors contributing to our recent performance and the initiatives we have in place to accelerate our momentum. Lauren Peters, Foot Lockers Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will then provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter. Ric?","Richard Johnson","Thank you, John and good morning, to all of you. Thank you for joining this morning. Let me start by saying we\u2019re certainly not satisfied with our results this quarter, even though it was still a highly profitable quarter, one of our company\u2019s best ever. Despite the unprecedented challenges we experienced early in the quarter.","Our goal is to continually raise the earnings bar higher and we did not quite succeed in achieving that in the first quarter. Lauren and I will get into the details of the pluses and minuses in the period but I do want to emphasize that we remain confident in our strong position in the athletic retail industry. We have been diligently executing our strategic initiatives which I\u2019ll remind you are, to drive performance in our core business, to expand our leading position in Kids, pursue European expansion opportunities, to improve our apparel business, build a more powerful digital business, to deliver exceptional growth in women's, and to build on our industry leading team.","We\u2019ve have made significant progress on each of these initiatives and I want to thank our outstanding team of associates who have made that progress possible. In fact, it is because of the exceptional efforts of what I believe is the best team in retail that our banners are positioned at the center of a very vibrant sneaker culture. That said, our customers are moving faster than ever before, thanks primarily to the fact that young people today are digital native. They change their shopping and buying habits quickly, they adopt and discard social media platforms in a heartbeat. The people who influence their preferences can change rapidly. And as a result of all of this, they see and adapt new athletic footwear and apparel styles more quickly than ever. ","We believe that the progress we have made in our initiatives and the tremendous opportunities still ahead of us to seize have enabled us to weather the recent slowdown in the business and staying at the center of sneaker culture. We will drive improvements in our results as the year progresses. In a moment I\u2019ll give you an overview of why we believe that, but first let me level set the first quarter and our outlook for the coming quarters in 2017.","John mentioned that our comparable sales finished Q1 up 0.5%. It was a bit of a roller coaster ride, as we noted in our pre-announcement last month comparable sales in February historically one of the biggest months of the year for us were down low teens. March rebounded to be up high single digits. April also lined up with a very high single digit increase. Although we have been expecting April to finish up low double digits, the last couple of weeks of the quarter were strong, but not quite as strong as we anticipated. This caused us to produce earnings of a $1.36 per share at the low-end of our revised outlook. ","Sales have been trending a bit lower than we had planned over the last few weeks. We are now forecasting the second quarter comparable sales will be up low single-digits with earnings relatively flat compared to a year ago. While we remain optimistic that we can accelerate our momentum over the second half of 2017 to reach mid-single digit comparable sales gains, we are developing a plan B so to speak, if these recent sales trends continue. That Plan B is primarily focused on controlling the expenses and inventory so we can deliver the mid single-digit EPS increase for the full year excluding the 53rd week that we mentioned in our pre-announcement, even if top-line growth is more modest than we originally planned.","Let me now give you just a few examples of the opportunities we have for each of the initiatives I outlined in the beginning of my remarks.","Together these give us the optimism that our momentum will accelerate over the rest of the year. First, our core mail banners, Foot Locker North America and Australia, Champs Sports and Action continued to operate at a very high level of productivity. We are maintaining our efforts to further elevate our customers engagement with these banners with investments in our physical stores including the addition of high profile stores this year in Toronto, Chicago, Los Angeles, Sydney and Melbourne.","We will also continue our successful remodel programs in each of these standards. On the technology side, we will roll out a next generation point-of-sale system later this year which will improve the customer experience in all of our stores, that\u2019s just our pinnacle properties. While U.S. store traffic was down in the quarter, the drop was entirely driven by February which we believe was heavily influenced by the delayed tax refunds. Traffic in the remainder of the quarter improved and we expect traffic which has been positive most of last year to normalize over the balance of the year.","In terms of our second initiative, we have a strong leadership position and the market for our aesthetically [ph] inspired footwear and apparel for kids. Remember these kids are moving faster than ever and the first quarter was especially challenging for children, in part because the vendors don\u2019t make some of today\u2019s most popular styles in kid sizes.","In any case, we did not have sufficient quantities of some of the hot lifestyle run-in products that our adult customers have been snapping up. That issue paired with a still soft signature basketball business which has been a relative important component of our Kids sales in the recent years meant that the Kids business faced an uphill battle in the first quarter. Fortunately, as we move to the rest of the year the Kids exposure to signature basketball will lessen and we expect lifestyle product quantities to improve.","We have targeted our buyers over the remainder of the year at the best available styles from Audi, Nike and Puma. We also continue to see opportunities to expand the footprint of Kids Foot Locker across all of our markets. We have 33 new stores slated for this year with 20 in North America and 13 in overseas markets which will enable us to build out our already strong position in Kids.","European expansion is our next growth pillar while comparable sales of our Foot Locker stores in Europe were down low single digits in the quarter, total store sales were up slightly given the addition of 26 net new locations compared to a year ago. Given recent macro events in Europe, traffic there was uneven cross our major markets and down in the quarter overall.","We consistently find that our customers in Europe are quite resilient and so we believe the traffic there will gradually rebound. Just as in North America, we are continuing to invest in elevating our customer experience in Europe with pinnacle new stores coming to Rome and Turkey [ph] later this year. While we are also planning close to 100 other new stores in remodel projects. Comparable store sales were down mid single-digits at Runners Point and Sidestep store, certainly not acceptable, but an improvement from their previous run-rate.","We believe we have cycled through them most difficult prefix and the segmentation strategy that we\u2019ve started a couple of years ago. With new leadership in place there and with ongoing investments to improve our understanding of the customers and most importantly stronger product offerings, we believe that Runners Point and Sidestep in return to top growth as we progress through the year.","Meanwhile our Internet business in Europe continues to grow rapidly. Digital sales were up strong double-digits for Foot Locker and Runners Point in the quarter and even higher for the Sidestep, off a smaller base. In fact, Foot Locker Europe did comp positive overall when combining digital and store results. We expect the momentum in Europe's digital business to continue throughout 2017. Apparel, our next growth initiative had a solid quarter, whereas in 2016 we made progress on profitability, but still lost penetration relative to footwear this quarter we saw faster growth in the apparel than footwear. At the same time, profit margins increased again.","Champs Sports, which had the highest apparel penetration continued to perform well. In addition to a strong brand of business Champs has really led the way in demonstrating that we can design the latest trends into our private label products, so, at or close to price and enhance our overall apparel margin. Couple of other balance made notable progress too, one example is Kids Foot Locker, where apparel sales posted a high single-digit comp gain with improved margins. In fact, each banner has apparel strategies to enhance our vendor partnerships, improve speed to market and share best practices. We are also continuing to enhance the use of our own team addition apparel printing capabilities which helps get popular new designs into our stores more quickly and optimize our private label opportunity.","We intend to use all of these building blocks to improve apparel results even further over the rest of the year. In terms of building our digital business, we are making progress on the number of fronts. A key investment we have been making is in the new e-commerce platform in order management system which I'm pleased to report has now gone live to one of our smallest online banners. We are monitoring performance while continuing testing and development for our other larger banners with a thoughtful rollout scheduled over the rest of this year and into 2018. This new platform is expected to significantly enhance our online conversions by increasing page load speed, improving product displays and suggested add-on purchases, optimizing video content and connecting ever more seamlessly with our other customer [indiscernible].","Although, we\u2019ve had Boss and Moore's technology for some time now, we are still fine tuning how to best leverage our inventory to enhance our customers experience, while we will always want to satisfied a customer by being able to ship them the product they want from wherever in our system it resides, an even better scenario for us is to have them come to a store to pick up their merchandize, where we can then engage with them, augment their experience with our brands and potentially add to their original purchase.","Overall having the latest systems capabilities will facilitate our more fundamental evolution into an organization which truly does not think in terms of separate channels. As we know full well that our customers naturally think of our brands as inclusive of all channels. This enhanced stability to focus on all elements of our brands will align better with the perspective of our customers and we believe drives stronger financial performance over the coming quarters and year.","Finally, our women's business had another strong quarter with the SIX:02 being only store banner that's posted double digit comparable sales gain. With the two relatively new non-comp flagship stores in New York city, total sales at SIX:02 were actually up more than 50%. We're planning to open another flagship location in Los Angeles is Q4 also within a key Foot Locker store.","SIX:02's biggest stores is actually our digital site, six02.com. We intend to focus the brands development the rest of this year by leading with digital. We plan to bring even stronger merchandizing to the site and build a sustainable and more diversified bash in creditability for SIX:02.","Meanwhile, our women's business and our other banners continues to provide steady growth aided by we believe by the enhanced focus we have on the female muses of each of our core banners. She has an ever-broader array of influences on her fashion choices than our male counterparts and our banners are important destinations for her athletically inspired footwear choices. On top of all of these initiatives is her most critical element of our success compelling product stories and assortments from our vendor partners like Nike, Adidas and Puma in particular are producing exciting innovation with coveted new products still selling out quickly. Although there are as always also some styles that are on or approaching the download side of their lifecycle.","Compared to the first quarter, we believe that products flow will strengthen in the second quarter even more so as we get into back to school. VaporMax is a perfect example of really great innovative new program from Nike. After a small introduction in Q1, the number of SKUs in units we'll have available will increase significantly during the current quarter and in the back half of the year. Similarly, we'll have some of the Audi product with boost [ph] material notably Nomads and Ultraboost, more reiteration and in better [indiscernible] the combination of all of these great products and strategic initiatives that gives us confidence that we can drive gradually improving topline and less bottom-line performance over the balance of the year.","Let me now turn the call over to Lauren to give you the usual details of the quarter after which we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions. ","Lauren Peters","Thank you, Dick and good morning, to you all. Dick has just given you some great color on the first quarter. I\u2019ll fill in some of the details.","First on the topline, let\u2019s breakout our comparable sales by segment. The direct to customer segment delivered a solid performance, with an overall comparable sale gained of 12.1% while our stores posted a 1.2% comparable sales decline. Within direct to customer, sales at our storebanners.com business in the U.S. were up high single digits while our digital operations in Europe and Canada were both up strong double-digit.","East Bay which remains our single largest digital banner was up low single-digit, a solid improvement from its performance over the past year. Overall, direct-to-customer sales increased to 13.9% of total sales from 12.7% a year ago. In our store segment, Champs Stores and Foot Locker Canada continue their strong sales results each delivering mid single-digit comp increases, driven by gains in both footwear and apparel. The other side of the ledger, Foot Locker in the U.S., Foot Action and Foot Locker Asia-Pacific posted low single-digit comparable stores sales decline. While sales at Kids Foot Locker were down in the mid teen. ","Turning to families of business, footwear was close to flat, apparel increased mid single-digit and accessories posted in mid single-digit decline. Within footwear as Dick mentioned women's footwear was strong posting a comparable sales gain just shy of double-digit. The men's footwear sales were up low single-digit, while sales of our children's footwear declined mid single-digit. By category, continued strong demand for lifestyle silhouette led to the mid-teens gain in running. Casual footwear was down mid single-digit, while basketball was down mid single-digit due in part we believe that the delay of IRS tax refund cheques until after the NBA All Star game.","Average selling prices in footwear were up mid single-digit, reflecting customers continued demand for premiums makers while units were down mid single-digit. Strengthen our apparel business was relatively broad based, with gains across most of our geographies, channels and genders. Men's and Children's were both up mid single-digit, while our women's apparel business posted a double-digit gain. ASP is an apparel were up double-digits, while units were down reflecting the company's ongoing shift to a more premium assortment.","Turning now to the rest of the income statement. Our gross margin rates came in at 34% in the first quarter, off 100 basis points from last year's 35% rate. A lower rate reflects a 40 basis points decline in our merchandize margin rate and a 60 basis points of deleverage on our occupancy and buyer's compensation expenses. Lower merchandize rate was primarily as a result of higher markdowns at our direct-to-customer business, where we win more promotional than in the past in order to drive traffic and clear slower moving products. At our stores, the markdown rate actually continued to improve even with the softer top line sales relative to our expectations. Despite the current promotional retail environment, our strategy continues to be to provide exciting destination for our customers primarily focused on selling premium sneakers and apparel at full price.","As expected, occupancy cost increased following the investments in our various power stores that Dick mentioned a few moments ago. We mentioned on the prior call that leveraging occupancy would be challenging in 2017. At the low single-digit comp that was the bigger challenge in Q1. Our SG&A expense rate rose in the quarter by 30 basis points at 18.5% of sales. The contributors to the SG&A deleverage were the lower than planned sales combined with a minimum wage increases and higher medical benefit cost that we discussed on the call in February.","In addition, the ongoing investments in our information and technology infrastructure while planned led to additional SG&A expenses year-over-year, offsetting some of the savings from lapping the cost of last year\u2019s move into our new office space.","Depreciation expense increased to $41 million from $39 million in the prior year. This expected increase reflects the higher levels of capital spending undertaken to enhance our store fleet, digital businesses, technology, logistics network and other infrastructure as we pursue our long-term objective. First quarter tax rate was 33%, 300 basis points lower than last year and close to our expectations.","As noted on our previous call, the lower rate was driven by the required change in the treatment of express cash benefits from share based compensation, the effect of which is likely to be highest in Q1. For 2017, we still expect the full year tax rate to be about 34%. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.49 billion of cash and cash equivalent, a decrease of $13 million from the end of Q1 last year.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 546,000 shares for $38 million and paid out 41 million to our recently increased $0.31 quarterly dividend. We also invested $75 million of capital into our business including opening 30 new stores and remodeling or relocating 61 stores.","We closed 39 stores, with the largest number of closures made up of Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker stores in the U.S. We ended the quarter with 3,354 company owned stores. On a constant currency basis, inventory increased 2.8% above our standard given our 1.8% currency neutral total sales growth. Despite being off standard, our long-standing practice of disciplined inventory management leaves us well positioned to flow fresh, exciting products to customers both in the current quarter and beyond.","Dick mentioned that we expect comparable sales for the second quarter to increase low single digits. But it already being our lowest sales volume quarter, this outlook would lead to a gross margin decrease of 60 to 80 basis points in Q2, with a similar mix of occupancy deleverage in a slightly lower merchandize margins as we experienced in the first quarter. SG&A leverage would also be a challenge with SG&A likely up 10 to 30 basis points as a rate of sale.","I want to close our prepared remarks by reiterating the confidence that Dick conveyed about being able to reignite our momentum over the rest of the year. We believe we have plenty of runway to go on all of our strategic initiatives and are optimistic about the upcoming product flow, yet we will remain derivative on controlling expenses and inventory, so that we can deliver improved earnings even in a somewhat challenging sales environment.","Silvana, let\u2019s go ahead and open up the call for question now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn Murphy","I have a couple of questions I guess. First starting off with second quarter, you talked about trends being a little bit slower. Are you currently seeing the business in a low single-digit range and so therefore your second quarter seems the continuation of that trend? Or are you assuming based on the product launches that the business picks up throughout the quarter?","Richard Johnson","Hi. Its Dick. We stop giving the quarter to date information a few quarters ago. And clearly, we\u2019ve given what we believe will happen in the second quarter and its all built into our forecast and we\u2019ve talked about in terms of low single-digits.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. Fair enough. And then just a couple of other ones. In your brand discussion that you\u2019ve talked about certain brands that were approaching a downward side of their lifecycle. Can you elaborate a little bit on that are there certain style or specific brands that you're just seeing meeting either more promotional or just kind of at that tail end of their cycle?","Richard Johnson","Let me be clear, it was not brands that are on the end of their lifecycle it was specific styles that are on their end of their lifecycle. If you go back a year Erinn, every -- assuming every teenage female potentially in the world needed to have a pair of Adidas Superstar or Stan Smiths, while we\u2019re still selling a lot of Superstars and Stan Smiths that basic trend has changed a little bit, or that request -- require footwear for that teenage girl has shifted. So, we managed through style changes all of the time, but it's one of those things that, there was such a rabid sense of, got to have that product last year, it hasn\u2019t quite been replace with something that\u2019s got that same sort of velocity, but we managed few of those up cycles and down cycles all the time. So to be clear, it's not brands, it was referenced to specific styles.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. And then just on that style specifically, it\u2019s a lot more prevalence in the mall today. You can see it whether it\u2019s a turnkey [ph] or even more of the department stores are kind of getting better allocation. Do you think that consumer is going elsewhere or do you think that more reflective of that style being, like you said, the end of the lifecycle?","Richard Johnson","I think it\u2019s a -- the cycle being slowing down certainly, right and the Superstars and Stan Smiths have been around a long time and they have the ways that they come through and that\u2019s a great example that certainly they are available at places, but our consumer, our core consumer moves very quickly and we still are selling a lot of Superstars and Stan Smiths, it's not just basic black and white or white and black --.","Erinn Murphy","She might be opting the version with pink strips or different fabrics?","Richard Johnson","Absolutely. ","Erinn Murphy","Okay. And then just last question and I'll pop up in. Just big picture if you think about your strategy across Q1 going forward. It seems like some of the headwinds you had this quarter deferred tax rate funds maybe the relative importance of the All-Star week. I mean some of those headwinds are likely going to continue as we think about the next couple of years. So, how do you strategically think about some of the levers you have in that first quarter to execute it better in the future? Thanks.","Richard Johnson","Yeah. So, when we expect the tax sequence and to say the same going forward, right depending on what happens with any sort of tax reform, I don\u2019t imagine that the path is going to change and the reasons that they slowed down are the reasons to try to fight broad [ph], et cetera. The All-Star game continues to be a relevant moment in our customers journey each year, next year the All-Star game is in Los Angeles, which again we have a lot investment that we\u2019re making in LA.","So what we have built with our great vendor partners, February and to be the hottest month even as I noted its one of our largest, biggest retail months and we\u2019ve been fortunate in the past to have sort of the perfect storm with tax miss, the All-Star game, great silhouettes being available, Valentine\u2019s Day, all sort of coming together. So we\u2019ll certainly have to adjust our thinking as we look at Q1 making sure that we get the flow right because that perfect storm of things coming together is not likely to replicate itself. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that any of our strategies are wrong as it relates to the first quarter, we just have to think through the timing.","Lauren Peters","The timings differ, we build great businesses around when our customers are excited about products and have the cash and we\u2019ll continue to do that.","Erinn Murphy","Alright, thank you guys and all the best.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Nikic with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Nikic","So it kind of feels like there was a little bit less conversation around Adidas on this call relative to prior calls? You know I think you mentioned relative to Erin\u2019s question that maybe there was a little bit less steam in the Superstars and the Stan Smiths, but can you talk about trends in Ultraboost and the Nomads and some of those other styles and if there is momentum there? And if there is anything kind of in the Nike assortment besides say VaporMax which you mentioned, which you have a level of excitement about? Thanks.","Richard Johnson","There is a lot of -- thanks Tom for the question. There is a lot of great stuff coming on from Adidas you know and certainly Superstars and Stan Smiths are in one part of the lifecycle, but when you look at things like Tubular Shadow and Nomads and EQT, you know lot of Ultraboost products, lot of Pureboost, we\u2019ve got AlphaBounce we\u2019ve got [indiscernible] and you know there is a lot of things coming from Adidas as well. So the fact that Superstars and Stan Smiths are part of their downward part of the lifecycle potentially. All of these other things are continuing to fuel the great brand heat that Adidas has done.","Even some excitement around the James Hardin basketball shoes, so again there is a lot of good things on that side of the equation. Certainly, VaporMax from Nike is an exciting new innovation. We expect it to continue to resonate of our consumer and obviously it launched in Q1, but we expect more SKUs and styles and quantities available as we go forward. There is some of the old standby\u2019s that are still bringing heat as well. we\u2019ve got the Huarache, we\u2019ve got the Special Forces that is AirForace One, the Paul George basketball shoe, Kyrie Irving's basketball shoe are all doing great. We see upside with the LeBron shoe just based on a little bit of shift in timing from last year.","To Narrow which is a Foot Locker exclusive with Nike is resonating not just in Europe or in Australia were its sort of been a foundational part of their business, but its starting to get some traction back in the U.S. as well. So a lot of great heat from both of those brands.","Tom Nikic","Okay. Great. Thanks. And if I could just ask one more about SG&A. I think you talked about tightening or controlling expenses this year. Is there any kind of additional color there? And should we think that the growth rate of SG&A in dollars should moderate in the back half of the year?","Lauren Peters","Yeah. We remain very disciplined about spending those expense dollars, the SG&A, the bigger element in it is selling wages. And so managing that very carefully is about managing that hours and making sure that you have the hours associated with your peak selling period. And then that you\u2019ve got the very best sales folks on the floor during the peak period so that you make the most of those hours to deliver great customer experiences.","It is a bit of art, along with a lot of science and each of our operating divisions manages that process for their business. We\u2019ve invested in tools to help them with that, part of this controlling it is making sure that we\u2019re applying the best practices in doing that across the different operating businesses.","So, when we talk about plan B or we\u2019re planning out making sure that we\u2019ve really are making the best use of the tools to manage those hours the best. And then there are lots of other elements, right. You\u2019ve got lots of other variables including what we spend on marketing, there is a bit of the business where that marketing expense in the digital sphere has lots of analytics around it, so that you can make sure that you're spending those dollars wisely that to drive traffic and conversion, and the metric gets a little bit tougher when you translate that marketing to the stores environment, but we can couple it with digital to make sure we\u2019re achieving traffic increases in conversion and stores environment as well.","So, that\u2019s an element, right. I can spend hours talking to you about expense, including things like utility that making good use of LED bulb. We have a very, very talented group of expense managers that watch our nickels because they all add up.","Tom Nikic","Got it. Thanks very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Boss ","I guess the dig beneath the surface with all the shift here. Dick, what you attribute the more choppy top line in athletic here? Does your Plan B, is it based on a more of a near-term blip or do you think we\u2019re seeing a turn in the cycle? And I guess with that more micro, what categories have you seen re-slow in May. And then how would you rank the opportunities to improve in the back half for the year?","Richard Johnson","Matt, I remain firmly a believer of that it's not a cycle, right. We are living in a world that is capsulized, sneakers are a part, a very important part of our consumers wardrobe, they accessorize with it, sometimes they are the statement effort. So, again I think we have some shifts in Q1, obviously the tax shift being one that certainly impacts our customer in their desire to purchase sneakers when they've got that cash. I know there has been some proof that people don\u2019t necessarily believe that. But, there is a direct correlation to tax checks hitting and sneaker sale.","The shift of Easter, the later shift of Easter, which again we saw traffic increases in March and April combined as we looked at the Easter shift, but that shift is still impacting us. You know the Assentation Day holiday in Europe is next week and there is a whole bunch of school breaks which are generally good for sales for us as well. So again, it\u2019s not really -- there is not comp to comp sort of comparison.","We\u2019ve talked about a little bit about the signature basketball, especially in Kids and you know I\u2019m not as focused on categories. You know it\u2019s about the coolest sneakers and then right now a lot of the sneakers heat happens to be coming out of running silhouettes. But we\u2019re also seeing some heat from some companies like Vans, they're old school and skate highs. So our consumer is migration to what they see as the coolest shoe and they do that fairly effectively and our buyers are moving with them and trying to stay half a step ahead of them as we pivot through the product assortment.","Matthew Boss","Got it. And then just a follow-up, Lauren are you comfortable with the overall inventory exiting the first quarter. I guess any pockets of excess if you looked by banner? And then just on that gross margin, what\u2019s the magnitude of the merch margin decline in 2Q and how should we model the back half of the year from a merchandize margin perspective?","Lauren Peters","So our disciplined approach to inventory management that we\u2019ve been very consistent with helps us come out of a period like Q1 feeling good about the freshness of the inventory and that we can manage the rail. So the merchant team looks through the individual SKUs, the depths of what's on hand, the rate of sell through and they take the appropriate action. And we are able to take advantage of the fact that we are omnichannel to help us move through things by getting more eyeballs on it and making that inventory that might be in the stockroom available to the folks looking at it on our website.","So we use that to our advantage and as we described, we actually came out of Q1 with fewer markdowns on the stores as we used the tools available to us. So we felt good about the inventory coming out of Q1 and we'll be disciplined about the buy go-forward with our expectations around the top line and make sure that inventory stays fresh. But coming back to your question about second quarter with the low single digit top line expectation, our thoughts around gross margin are that we\u2019ve got again the deleverage 60 to 80 basis points and because we felt occupancy in there.","So its Q2 is a lower sales volume quarter for us and we would experience deleverage on the occupancy and perhaps a little bit of pressure on the merchandize margin as we saw in the first quarter. So as we look at the back half, you know if you\u2019re talking about mid-single digit top line which is how we\u2019re seeing that back half, that we get an opportunity to squeak a bit of leverage out of gross margins. But I would be slight because of that occupancy dynamic. Is that helpful?","Matthew Boss","Yeah, that was very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Cummins with B. Riley & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Mitch Cummins","Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. I want to start on the basketball business, it sounded like it was a pretty big headwind in the quarter. It hurt your Kids business I would imagine that the tax refund delays didn\u2019t align with the All-Star game and all of that. But, like how big is basketball in Q1 relative to the rest of the year? I would imagine that it\u2019s definitely outsized in Q1. Is that\u2019s the case?","Robert Johnson ","We don\u2019t really break down the size of categories across the seasons of quarters Mitch. And coming around the Kids basketball product is relevant because they don\u2019t have some of the offsets with some of the running styles that the adult assortment has yet. The boost product for example is not taken down in the Kids models. So, there is more pressure on basketball and the Kids world, then necessarily across the adult banner. So, historically if you looked at the heat that\u2019s been brought around the All-Star game. There is some basketball business done in the first quarter, but we also grew a lot of basketball business throughout the other quarters as well.","Mitch Cummins","Okay. And then on running, I think the comments, I can't remember if it was you or Lauren made, that it was lifestyle running that was up mid-teens, maybe I heard that incorrectly, but is there -- could you give us kind of an overall running comp for the quarter?","Lauren Peters","Yeah. It's Total Running mid-teens.","Mitch Cummins","Oh, that was Total Running mid-teens. Okay. Great. And then maybe lastly, do you have any comments on the real estate situation. Obviously, there is the bankruptcies and store closings. Just kind of curious if at some point that kind of works to your advantage as you go through lease renewals or I don\u2019t know if there is any sort of like kick outs or co-tenancy agreements that you guys can sort of leverage to help out from that standpoint. And maybe bring your leverage point down a little bit?","Robert Johnson ","Yeah. That\u2019s an ongoing process, Mitch. We\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s still focused, we\u2019ve got a very mature estate team and in expense management team that actually looks at the co-tenancy violations and kick out opportunities. We have certain percentage of our leases up that were years, so we certainly leverage those occupancy rates where we can to try to improve our position in each of those malls and in some cases we take shorter term leases because malls may be deteriorating.","But, yeah over time I absolutely expect that we\u2019ll get some leverage, there'll some malls that close, certainly we look at street stores as opportunities, we look at strip malls as opportunities. It\u2019s above creating the heat, the product creates the heat, we\u2019re trying to provide great destinations for our consumer. And we\u2019ll try to leverage I guess other people miss fortunately when we talked about bankruptcies, et cetera, to try to be in a better position, stronger position financially.","Mitch Cummins","Okay. All right. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert Drbul","Hi, Dick. Good morning. I guess the one question that I have is, when you look at the trends out there. Do you think that the direct-to-consumer efforts of some of the brands are impacting the business at all today?","Robert Johnson ","At all, sure. Right, I mean I think that there is some pressure from everybody that sell sneakers, we\u2019re all fighting for consumers. I think that our understanding of our consumer base and our connectivity trying to create consistent authentic memorable experiences for our consumer whether they are in-store or online with us to allow us to push back against that.","But, certainly people have a lot of shopping to us, its whether its online or places in malls around street. So I don\u2019t know that its anymore right Bob, then it has been, but will continue to be diligent across all of the channels and leverage our inventory and our experiences with our consumers across all those channels. ","Lauren Peters","And we know these customers well and we know the differences in those customers across our different brands. We understand what motivates them, what they were excited about and that's what we focus on bringing to them. So with that focus they know they've got to come to us to check out what we\u2019ve got before they make a purchase decision.","Robert Drbul","Alright.","Robert Johnson","Bob, just one other quick point, you know the vendors continue to support our initiatives, right. We\u2019re building House of Hoops, we\u2019re looking at Kicks Lounges. The Fly Zones in Kids foot locker opening the Jordon Storm Paris, you know all of those things just speak to the strength of the relationship with key vendor partners.","Robert Drbul","And Dick, do you think that the Big Dollar brand is at all playing a role here in terms of attention or tucking dollars out of the marketplace?","Robert Johnson","No. ","Robert Drbul","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randy Konik with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. ","Randy Konik","Kind of disappointed about that Big Dollar brand, but I guess just a quick question, how do you think about you as you say the life cycle or the trend cycle of the Adidas Superstar and Stan Smiths start to erode, how should we be thinking about go forward AFP and unit trends just generally speaking, how should we be thinking about that on a rolling four quarter basis going forward? Thanks.","Robert Johnson","Randy we\u2019ve proven overtime and talked many times in the last couple of years about our ASP model. You know we continue to see ASPs expanding and we believe that that is going to go forward. But ASP is not as simple as Superstars or VaporMax or something like that. I mean it\u2019s a very complex formula, the amount of apparel that we sell factors in, we're selling $29.99 accessory kits versus $10 accessory kit, all those things factor into ASP. So we look at the ASP model and believe it has an opportunity to continue to increase and as it did in the first quarter with units being down a little bit. So we got that goring forward.","Randy Konik","Right. I guess the only question is, given that these two shoes style had some really crazy impact on the total market in the last 12 months definitely from a unit perspective, that\u2019s why I kind of asked about any type of nuances on thought process on units going forward because it was like you said everybody and their mother had these shoes on. So I am just curious on -- I get the ASP commentary, I\u2019m just curious on how do you think about the unit trajectory going forward for the market?","Robert Johnson","Let me be clear, we still saw an awful lot of Stan Smiths and Superstars, right. It\u2019s just that they backed out their pinnacle and they are on the -- they\u2019ve been on this roller coaster for years and so I don\u2019t again its one or two styles across our entire assortments Randy. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily have an impact in the bigger picture for us.","Randy Konik","Understood. Can I ask one last thing. ","Robert Johnson","Sure. ","Randy Konik","Did you see any traffic or transactional volume differentials by real estate type? Meaning, in closed malls versus kind of city location centers. Just trying to get some perspective on any types of nuances in the traffic patterns or transactional patterns?","Robert Johnson","No significant changes, certainly we\u2019ve has street stores and important locations for long time. We\u2019ve had big mall stores for a long time. Our business in Europe is far more street based than mall base. So, no significant changes Randy in the transactional patterns. They to a certain degree follow where the population moves and as population does become a little more urban based over the coming years, expect that our strip stores will pick up a bit, we\u2019ve read what everybody has written about the death of malls, which we don\u2019t ascribe to that theory by the way, but as mall traffic changes that will also change traffic there. But nothing significant I\u2019d call out.","Randy Konik","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you so much.","Robert Johnson","Thanks, Randy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Poser with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Sam Poser","Thanks for taking my question. I guess the real question I have is when you look at February, March, April with all of the twist and turns from the calendar and everything. When do you think -- I mean how much of a real view of what's going on, do you have given all the shift. And if you don\u2019t have a clear view now, when do you think the full calendar thing sort of balances out, where you can look at a trend on an apples-to-apples basis?","Robert Johnson","Yeah. That\u2019s a great question, Sam. Because they really are no two days that are truly purely comped. So, again the Easter holiday, the really -- just holiday shift continues to impact the business in Europe with the two week shift. So, we study it every day, right, we look at the patterns that we expect, we look at the historical patterns. So, the guidance that we\u2019ve gave is based on the view that we have today, and I don\u2019t know that there is a clear moment in time that we suddenly say everything is perfectly aligned comp wise from here on out. So, I think we have as good a vision today as we have tomorrow.","Sam Poser","I guess, I guess I really mean to ask is, does the way that you -- the way that February, March and April work together or would you compare that to the last year February, March and April, if not apples-to-apples at all. At what time period do you foresee being able to get a read on exactly the actual health of the business, if its mid singles or if its low singles or whatever it is, because I know what you see right now, but you're seeing what you're seeing, but it is an apples-to-apples. So, where do you think you'll sort of get a better comp view at what position?","Robert Johnson","Sam, I'm not quite sure how to answer your question, because we look at our comp views every day and every day we give more clarity and we get some things that cause more confusion. So, a launch shift here, a more out of a quarter of a product there, delayed shipment here, all of those things can have an impact on it. So, again I don\u2019t think there is a nirvana point that says this is where we see things perfectly. We make adjustments every day based on what we see.","Sam Poser","Thanks very much and good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binnetti with UBS. Please proceed with your question. ","Michael Binnetti","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just clarify one thing on the model please? Lauren, I think I heard you say in the second half of revenue guidance is positive mid single-digit. I know you have a 53rd week and a little bit of footage growth, so I am just trying to clarify is the plan still that in the back half we can expect mid single-digit comps in each quarter after 2Q?","Lauren Peters","Mid single digit for Q3, Q4. ","Michael Binnetti","Comps or revenue?","Lauren Peters","Double digit EPS of what we\u2019re towards with that mid single-digit topline over Q3, Q4 ex-53rd week. ","Michael Binnetti","Okay. And then just a few things on the quarter really quick. You mentioned the improved merchandize margins in stores given the heavy promotional cadence at the mall in the quarter that we saw, it was a little surprising. Do you feel like you left any business on the table in stores based on the promotional strategy?","Richard Johnson","Our position Michael has not changed, right. We\u2019re selling premium sneakers, the consumers are coming into to our stores, looking for premium sneakers that they can\u2019t find elsewhere. So we marked down product as appropriate to manage the lifecycle of products. But you know I feel like we leave business on the table every single day, but I think we maximize the amount of business that we take off the table.","So where there is always a customer that we didn\u2019t get to, there is always a size that we didn\u2019t have and they didn\u2019t want to wait. I don\u2019t, our promotional cadence is set by our managing our inventory, our appealing to our customers desires and I think the way that we see it, we\u2019re going to remain that premium destination. And I don\u2019t expect that our guys in the operating divisions are going to go start chasing discounters in the mall, because that\u2019s not who our customers are frankly.","Michael Binnetti","And just one longer term question and if you think about the cost structure, I know this year you\u2019ve got bit of sticky costs on some of the bigger marque stores. I think your lead times on stores like that are pretty long, so you look at the 2018, do you have the same store open fresher on the cost structure out of the year based on the leases you\u2019re looking at today and then you mentioned plan B on the cost side. You know is there anything in particular you\u2019re looking at before you break glass on some of the cost structure. I was just right from the hours, just sounds like you\u2019re managing the hours in the stores pretty tactically but you know is there some point on the horizon you\u2019re looking at for you say like let\u2019s look at some of the more non-store expenses based on the reality here and traffic levels.","Lauren Peters","I don\u2019t see it break glass in the time period. I mean we\u2019ve got as we\u2019ve described with the power stores, early days of their lease life you got more rent over a straight-line basis, so levering that is more challenging as you get further into their life and you get the flip side of that. But we will continue to make sure that we got the appropriate locations and Dick described we see opportunities optimal and those can have more favorable occupancy metrics. But it will continue to be a mix, I don\u2019t see a day where that\u2019s really easy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert Ohmes","Dick, when should we expect the promotional environment for your online business to get less promotional, where are you guys in working through inventory? Is this something that continues in the back to school? Or are you almost through it. Where you guys have right now?","Richard Johnson","We\u2019ll continue to use the online business as a way to expose more of our product to more eyeballs. So, again the comment that Lauren made was, its been a bit more promotional in the first quarter to ensure that our inventories stay fresh and we\u2019ll continue to use that as an offensive weapon to do that.","Lauren Peters","Let me just call out that I described you that on the marketing side of our direct business, they can be very efficient with those dollars. So when you look at finished margins, they did quite well in levering their expenses. So, while you\u2019re more promotional among gross margin line you make that up with being more efficient on the expense line to drive that traffic.","Robert Ohmes","And as you guys look ahead to back to school. Do you expect to be in more promotional back to school in general than it was last year?","Richard Johnson","That\u2019s a great question, Rob. I mean, I think when you look at some of the people that are feeling various pressures, I expect some of the apparel side of the business continues to be growing promotional. I expect less promotional -- a less promotional cadence in our specific category and our specific area of expertise. Premium sneakers are not going to be highly discounted, I don\u2019t believe and our apparel teams are very conscious of what those on in the marketplace. But again our apparel is premium apparel, when you think about technically some of the things that motivate our customers. So, our customer is not coming to us looking for discounts. And while we promote as appropriate, we certainly don\u2019t see ourselves being more promotional in the back to school season.","Robert Ohmes","And just last thing. For back to school, just to clarify on the Kids business, do you think you will have the Boost product in kids? And also for back to school, what -- just trying to understand, what is the expectation for signature basketball for back to school? Are you expecting it to underperform?","Richard Johnson","Well, the boost product is not being taken down to kids in most silhouettes. So, the answer would be, it will not be. But there are other great silhouettes in running that are going to become more readily available in the Kids, in the back to school season. We talked about the signature basketball specifically in Kids, the pressure lessening in that product going into the back half of the year. So, if there are still going to be pressure on, but we certainly have less exposure in the back half, as we think about signature basketball in Kids.","Robert Ohmes","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. ","John Maurer","Okay, Silvana, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank Research. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. So, Dick you\u2019re standing by mid single-digit comps in the second half as well as double-digit earnings growth in the second half. My sense listening to this call to the analyst and the questions that are being asked here, and some investors. I don\u2019t sense a comfort level with that view after what will be two consecutive quarters of low single-digit comps and no earnings growth. I hope to get more confident on that front about your second half and specifically maybe dig a little bit more on how the second quarter is just a blip. I think, the first quarter is somewhat understandable for most folks given that the delay, tax refunds and weak February scenario, but you said that when the consumer has the cash, they shop at Foot Locker and historically your merchants have been very well prepared for changes in style preferences. So hard to understand why this time is different.","Richard Johnson","It\u2019s just a little bit of a lag Paul and I mean the product that I talked about earlier in my -- to somebody\u2019s question. We see an increased flow of product, both from an innovation point of view. But more importantly for us, from a style and desk point of view, right. VaporMax was the example that I used. Certainly a great launch, initial launch in Q1, but nobody does it better than Nike in terms of controlling the quantities in the marketplace and making sure they\u2019ve got production capabilities, et cetera to support it. So we see the style and units in several key programs going up in the back half and obviously the consumer, we believe will respond to that.","So we remain very confident and it\u2019s, the consumer hasn\u2019t gone elsewhere and this segment continues to be very hot. If you look at the people that are influencing things in this category. Kanye West with his Easy product. We expect that to continue to be incredibly hot going into the back half and we expect our quantities to go up. So again it\u2019s about the pipeline that we see not just from renovation, but from depth across those innovative and really high demands styles that we see. So it\u2019s the sauce that we get to make and our buyers have done a great job of pivoting to the right places and now giving the quantities behind them in the end of Q2 and going into Q3 and Q4 is critical and we believe we\u2019re well positioned to do that.","Paul Trussell","So and just a follow-up on that front. Again, so mid-single-digit comps in third and fourth quarter along with double-digit earnings growth. In a scenario in which you are closer to low-single-digit comps, a continuation of the second quarter trend for one reason or another. Help us understand how we should think about earnings growth in the second half given some of these expense initiatives you are working on today?","Richard Johnson","I think Lauren was pretty clear, the expense initiatives are in place and it will continue to be exercised to ensure that we can get towards that double-digit earnings growth that we talked about in the pre-announcement in earlier today. I mean we understand that it\u2019s always easier when the top line is flowing more rapidly. But I also believe that our organization is talented enough and we understand all of the levers that can be pulled that we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be able to control expenses even if sales continue to be a bit softer.","Paul Trussell","Thank you and good luck.","Richard Johnson","Thanks Paul.","John Maurer","Okay. So that concludes our call for today. I'll be back at my desk shortly, if we didn\u2019t get your question and I'll answer any more follow-up questions you may have. Please join us on our next earnings call, which we anticipate will take place at 9 AM on Friday August 18, following the release of our second quarter results earlier that morning. Thanks again.

Maurer","Thank you, and welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter net income of $138 million or $0.90 per share. These results include approximately $1 million of transaction costs related to our pending acquisition of Runners Point Group, which we announced earlier in the month. Our first quarter EPS on a non GAAP basis, excluding this cost, was $0.91 per share. This resulted in an increase of almost 10% over the $0.83 per share that Foot Locker earned in the first quarter of 2012 and represents the highest quarterly profit the company has ever achieved as Foot Locker Inc.","Our prepared remarks will begin this morning with Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review our first quarter financial results in more detail. After Lauren, Dick Johnson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will provide an update on several of our key initiatives and comments on the pending Runners Point Group acquisition. Ken Hicks, our Chairman and CEO, will then provide additional insight into our business strategies and major trends we're seeing in the athletic industry.","In order to have plenty of time for your questions after our prepared remarks, let me turn the call right over to you, Lauren.","Lauren B. Peters","Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. We are quite pleased with the strong start to 2013 that we reported this morning. Our non GAAP earnings of $0.91 per share represents a solid improvement over the first quarter result we posted in 2012, especially in light of the relatively slow start in February we told you about on our previous call and the sales shift related to the 53rd week last year, both of which challenged our leverage opportunity.","Reviewing the results in detail, we reported a 5.2% comparable sales increase in the first quarter, with a 3.8% comp increase in our stores and an increase in our Direct to Customer segment of 18.2%. Our total reported sales increased 3.8%. We operated slightly fewer stores this year compared to last, but the primary driver of the 1.4% difference between our comp results of plus 5.2% and the total sales increase of 3.8% is that 53rd week sales shift I just mentioned. This difference equates to the $20 million shift in Q1 that I mentioned during our call in March.","Recall also that our sales, both comp and total, are impacted as we temporarily shut stores for some of the major remodels we are currently undertaking. Dick will touch on this during his remarks. We noted on our previous call that February's comp gain was in the low single digits. Largest comp gain rose to mid single digits despite losing a full day of sales compared to 2012 because of the Easter shift. And April came in at high single digits. The April result was encouraging, given that all of the Easter selling shifted into March and the weather remains stubbornly cold in many of our markets here and abroad during the first quarter.","Our domestic store divisions posted a mid single digit comp sales gain, led by Kids Foot Locker, which was up almost 20%. Also with the net overall comp sales gain was a high single digit comp decline at Lady Foot Locker, which Dick will address during his remarks. Foot Locker Europe and Foot Locker Canada posted low single digit comp gains, while Foot Locker Asia Pacific came in with a mid single digit comp gain. Within the 18.2% comp gain in our Direct to Customer business, Eastbay was up low double digits. Our store banner.com businesses continued their very strong performance with sales up almost 50%, while CCS.com was down high single digits.","Turning to families of business. Footwear had a solid mid single digit comp gain, with children's footwear up double digits and men's footwear up high single digits, while women's footwear was down mid single digits. Apparel was up in the quarter as well, although not as much overall as footwear.","In the U.S., we continued our momentum in building our apparel business with a mid single digit increase, led by especially strong digital sales. In that channel, apparel was up double digits in men's, women's and kids. Internationally, however, apparel sales were down, although I should add that our international apparel margins were higher compared to the year before, especially in Europe. As we mentioned at this time last year, some of those sales in Europe a year ago were markdown driven, strategically executed to keep our inventory fresh.","With that segue into gross margin, let me say that we were pleased to be able to produce a strong margin rate of 34.2% in the first quarter, an increase of 20 basis points. We gained 20 basis points in merchandise margin and another 10 basis points in leverage of our fixed cost. We gave back 10 basis points related to lower shipping and handling revenue.","In addition to the 10 basis points of leverage we picked up in gross margin, we delivered 20 basis points of leverage in SG&A, as we did a solid job flowing incremental sales dollars to the bottom line. We continue to drive productivity increases in our key internal metrics, such as sales per square foot and sales per payroll hour. And our 19.2% expense rate in the quarter is the best it has ever been as an athletic company.","As John mentioned, included in SG&A this quarter is approximately $1 million of transaction costs related to the Runners Point acquisition. Please note that there was also $1 million expense related to Runners Point included in SG&A in the fourth quarter last year, which we have not previously called out.","One line item that has increased is depreciation, which increased $2 million to $31 million. This increase relates to the higher levels of capital spending undertaken in the last couple of years.","A charge that did not occur in the first quarter that we indicated on our previous call was likely to happen relates to the closing of the 22 CCS stores. Due to the timing of liquidating inventory and converting many of the stores to other formats, those stores have not yet closed. However, the plan is now firm to close or convert them in early June. As a consequence, the $0.01 a share charge related to severance and exiting leases will be incurred in the second quarter.","On the previous call, we said we intended to close 88 stores in 2013, along with opening 73 new stores. The 88 figure did not include the 22 CCS stores. So total planned closures for the year are 110. Similarly, the estimate of opening 73 stores did not include conversions of CCS stores into other formats. So our current estimate of new store openings for 2013 is now 86.","So far, in 2013, we are largely on plan with both openings and closures, finishing the quarter with 3,321 stores, down 14 from the end of last year. Foot Locker Europe continues to open new stores and now operates approximately 600 doors. In the U.S., the biggest store count change continues to come out of Lady Foot Locker, which closed 21 doors in the first quarter. We will continue to work with our landlords to close underperforming stores throughout the year to improve the overall productivity of our fleet.","Turning back to Q1 results. Our tax rate came in at 36.1%, slightly better than the 36.4% rate last year, as we settled certain tax audits that allowed us to release some of our related cash reserves.","The overall result for the quarter was non GAAP net income of $139 million, the highest level of earnings in any quarter, not just the first quarter in our history as an athletic company. A result which we, the entire team at Foot Locker, are, of course, very proud of.","Moving on now to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and short term investments and an increase of $196 million from the end of Q1 last year. Our first quarter typically represents a peak in cash flow generation, with cash balances subsequently declining until we get to the year end holidays. This year, of course, we will also use some of our existing offshore cash to purchase Runners Point Group. And as we noted in our release about Runners Point Group, we did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter due to the ongoing negotiations related to that transaction. However, we intend to start the $600 million program in Q2.","We did just recently pay our first $0.20 dividend, which represents an 11% increase over the previous dividend rate, and we are well underway in executing the elevated capital spending program that we detailed on our previous call.","Focusing now on inventory.  It increased 2%, while total sales increased 3.8%. Our inventory remains fresh and productive, and we believe it is well positioned to support the mid single digit sales gains we continue to plan for the rest of the year. In fact, excluding Runners Point, which Dick will comment on in more depth in a moment, our outlook for the rest of 2013 remains largely unchanged from what I described in our previous call. Keep in mind that we continue to base our year over year comparisons on our 2012 non GAAP results, excluding the 53rd week. Earnings on that basis were $2.47 per share in 2012.","To review, we expect modest improvement in gross margin, 20 to 30 basis points, driven mainly by a leverage from higher sales but with the opportunity for some gains in merchandise margin as well. We also believe we can lever higher sales to produce a lower SG&A rate for full year 2013, with the second quarter having the best opportunity for gains due to the 53rd week sale shift and the third quarter being the most challenged. Our estimates of depreciation in 2013 is now $126 million, up slightly from the $122 million I mentioned on the last call. The full year tax rate is estimated to come in slightly below 37%, excluding any additional audit settlements that may occur.","Let me now turn the call over to Dick Johnson to review the progress of some of our key initiatives, including the pending acquisition of Runners Point Group.","Richard A. Johnson","Thanks, Lauren, and good morning. Let me start with Runners Point. We are all very excited about this opportunity to acquire a profitable, fast growing athletic business in a strong market. The Runners Point Group operates multiple banners, the most significant of which are Runners Point and Sidestep, and we believe we can help the current management team segment the market for the different banners we will have in Germany and adjacent countries, just as we have done successfully in North America. Over time, we will also begin providing them with world class operational support to help them pursue their growth strategy.","Once we close on the transaction and can really get in there and analyze relative productivity on a store by store basis, we may adjust the banner profile, perhaps changing some Foot Locker stores to Runners Point or Sidestep stores, or vice versa. We certainly appreciate the unique brand value their banners have built up in their markets, so we intend to operate multiple banners in many German markets just as we do with Foot Locker, Champs Sports and Footaction in the United States today. Down the road, we also plan to explore the potential for banner growth in other German    other European markets outside Germany.","For the consolidated Runners Point Group, comp sales grew almost 9% in calendar year 2012, led by a 63% gain in digital sales by Tredex, their e commerce subsidiary. Tredex accounted for more than 10% of RPG's overall sales of EUR 197 million in 2012. That 10% figure for digital sales, as a percent of total sales, is a goal we have for our own digital businesses. We have aways to go towards our goal, especially in Europe.","Due to comp gains, as well as store count growth, RPG sales in total increased about 18% for the year. The acquisition will solidify our position in Germany. And once the transaction closes, Germany will become our leading European market, surpassing Italy.","As I said at the beginning of my remarks, RPG has been profitable, and we expect it to remain so, as we added to our already profitable European portfolio. Thus, we believe the acquisition should be slightly accretive in 2013, excluding transaction and integration costs. Just how accretive it will be depends on many factors, not least of which is how long merger control review takes before we can actually close the transaction.","Let me turn now to providing you with updates on some of the initiatives of our existing business. As Lauren mentioned, we are on track with our elevated 2013 capital spending program of $220 million. We've already completed almost as many major remodel projects this year as we did during all of last year. And during this current period between Easter and back to school, the pace has picked up even further.","Our real estate team is doing a great job coordinating all the projects and figuring out how to roll out the new formats even more efficiently and quickly. So far, knock on wood, everything is going smoothly on the construction front and the performance of the completed projects continues to more than meet our hurdle rates.","One of our highest potential growth segments remains the opportunity to expand women's footwear and apparel to play a more significant role across all of our banners and channels. Currently, though, our women's business remains a work in progress. Our Lady Foot Locker and SIX:02 banners are continuing their efforts to attract the athletically active women in their 20s and 30s who is interested in style, fit and performance. The younger school age customer, who is more interested in fashion, is still finding her way to our other banners, such as Foot Locker and Champs Sports. But unlike the fourth quarter, when our women's sales in these other banners were up enough to offset the decline in Lady Foot Locker, in Q1, this was not the case.","One positive is that our margin rates in both women's footwear and apparel are higher than a year ago, as we have gotten more of the right merchandise and the right stores to serve our various female customers. Another positive is that our remodel Lady Foot Locker doors and larger SIX:02 doors are significantly outperforming the rest of the Lady Foot Locker chain. It encourages us that we are on the right track. However, we have many lessons to apply and many detailed aspects of the business to improve before we can tell you that we have found a sustainable, profitable formula that will determine our go forward strategy for Lady Foot Locker and SIX:02. We're still deep in the testing mode and are going to get the business right before committing a lot of capital to it.","One area we are currently hitting the cover off the ball is our Kids business. As Lauren mentioned, it is the fastest growing family of business, with footwear up low double digits and apparel up a lot more than that. We have created a more kid friendly environment in our Kids Foot Locker stores with a Pro Zone and Hero size footprints to help entertain our young customers. We are expanding and diversifying our kid assortment, in particular, by emphasizing branded apparel and accessories and are offering more casual and running footwear style for kids.","For example, we have a Crayola inspired assortment from Converse made just for kids. At the same time, our vendors and are continuing to provide more and more innovative takedowns of the adult Hero shoes. We expect that we will have remodeled over 20% of the Kids Foot Locker fleet by the end of the year to take advantage of the momentum we see in this business.","With that update of some of our most important initiatives, let me hand it over to Ken to provide more color on our company and the athletic industry.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Dick, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you all participated on our call this morning. Let me echo Lauren's comment early on and say how proud I am of the entire team at Foot Locker for setting yet another earnings record this quarter. Almost exactly 1 year ago, I said it isn't every quarter that I can say we achieved the highest level of net income and EPS in the history of our business as an athletic company. But now I wouldn't mind making a habit of it.","Let me say thank you again to all of our associates who built this momentum that made this results possible. We have a lot of strong teammates helping us, including our outstanding brand partners. Without great teamwork and excellent performance across our entire company and with our vendors and suppliers, record results like these just don't happen.","It takes a balanced team effort to win a championship, and that's how we look at what we're trying to do here, not just win a game or a series, but build a team that wins on a consistent basis. Even champions run into difficult stretches. The air pocket of lower sales we experienced in the second half of January and early February dissipated somewhat. And as Lauren mentioned, our comp cadence improved significantly as the months of Q1 progress.","Sales this quarter are similarly off to a bit of a slow start, with comps in May running about flat so far. Store comps are down slightly, offset by gain in our direct sales. I'm sure you all know that it would be unwise to put too much weight on sales over a period of just a few weeks. Weather, holiday shifts, store remodels and, of course, different launch cadences can cause deviations from the longer term trend. We believe the current comp rate will improve over the remainder of the quarter. And as Lauren said, over the balance of the year, we still expect to drive a mid single digit comp gain.","Turning back to what drove our record results in Q1. Basketball continue to be the biggest driver of our business in the first quarter, with Jordan, both retro and lifestyle product, particularly strong. The marquee player shoes, such as LeBron, KD and Kobe, are also selling well.","The running business in the U.S. was up in the quarter as well, led by Nike Free and our technical vendors, such as ASICS, Brooks and Mizuno. Running continues to trend off in some European markets, as many of our customers there are shifting to more basketball silhouettes, especially Jordan. As temperatures have risen recently in our major markets around the world, the running business is improving, which is good to see, especially since it's not pulling away from our basketball business.","The lifestyle footwear business led by various Adidas and Nike styles continues to perform well for us. Although the cross training business that featured Griffey and NoMo last year was down on a corner    quarter. Some product releases in that category were pushed back into Q2 this year. So we're optimistic that this business will pick up as a better assortments get into our stores and into our online sites. Overall, we're pleased with the performance of all of the legs of our stool: basketball, running, lifestyle footwear and apparel.","The Nike Jordan, Adidas and Under Armour brands led the way in apparel, with fleece and tees doing well. Graphic and attitude tees from our Team Edition facility performed well throughout our banners. The colored hook ups of tees and shorts with the hottest shoes continued to excite our customers with one of the best examples being the Jordan great package that launched at the end of the quarter.","Increases in apparel sales have been substantially exceeding footwear sales increases in the past couple of years, as we improve the assortments in each of the banners and told much stronger brand and color stories. In the first quarter of this year, the 2 categories increased to close to the same pace. As a result, our apparel penetration was at about the same level year over year. We believe apparel sales were impacted more than footwear by the cold weather in the first quarter this year compared to last. Long term, however, we still believe we have the ability to drive apparel penetration close to the 30% level it was back a decade ago.","Within Accessories, certainly one highlight continues to be performance socks from Nike, Adidas and Jordan, sales of which increased well into the double digits as innovation from the vendors remains very strong.","In addition to the improved productivity from store remodels that Dick talked about, we're continuing to build our technological capabilities in our stores, in our digital business and in our support functions.","Our industry leading capabilities in these areas remained, I believe, one of our underappreciated strengths. First, we continue to invest in technologies to make our inventory down to the very last unit available to our customers any way they come to see it, whether online, mobile or in store. This is a fairly complex proposition for a multi banner company, such as ours, where we need to maintain flexibility as well as maintain separate identities for each banner with our customers. This year, for example, our websites will show a product as long as it exists anywhere in our company, in a warehouse or in a store. Customers can then buy online and, if they choose, reserve in store. Similarly, in our stores, customers and our associates will be able to check on the availability of an item, wherever it may be, and we'll be able to ship it to their home or to the store of their choice.","Second, while the real estate and store construction teams are out creating exciting places for our customers to shop and buy, our system teams are working with their business partners developing best in class tools to help us do a better job buying and allocating product, hire the best retail talent, schedule hours efficiently, provide our associates with the best opportunity to maximize their success with the customer and optimize our warehouse and logistics processes among other initiatives.","We're just beginning to realize the benefits from some of the technologies we've already invested in, such as our business intelligence tool and in store handheld scanners. And these benefits should build over time, especially when combined with the systems we haven't even yet implemented, such as our new allocation system.","Finally, I want to touch on the Runners Point acquisition again. We're getting a profitable business with the strong leadership team out of the gate, and it is certainly digestible from a size perspective. It's not a business that's broken that we're going to need to fix, which is a bit of what we're dealing with in Lady Foot Locker business. Once we own Runners Point, we'll go through the same disciplined process we do with any investment opportunity and test any major changes to the product assortments in the different banners or any expansion opportunities we see before going into them full speed. We're excited about the transaction and look forward to welcoming the Runners Point team as they join our Foot Locker team. Together, we look forward to winning more championships in the years ahead.","Thank you. We'll be happy to take your questions now. Please go ahead, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Ken, your    a lot of good commentary on the apparel piece of the business this quarter, and it really seems like Team Edition's been great for you. I was wondering if you could maybe talk more on the private label part of the apparel business. And specifically, when we think about this business longer term, to get the business to where you want it to go, what are some of the building blocks that you still need to put in place to achieve your vision for that business?","Kenneth C. Hicks","What we    we believe private label apparel gives us an opportunity to fill voids that are not provided by the brands. We're going to be primarily a branded apparel retailer. But we    there are voids that we use private label and continuing to build on them, such as the cargo short business, very strong business for us; some T shirts. We also have the ability to develop brands, such as what we've done with Sneaker Freak in Europe and Actra with women's business. And so what we continue to do is evolve that business from a very promotional business that it used to be and use it to fill voids where we believe there is significant opportunities. And that may involve brands, or it may involve just using the private label as we do in shorts and fleece.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And if I can actually get one more question in just real fast. Runners Point, the e commerce opportunity seems pretty large in Europe, and I was just wondering if you could maybe, I think, discuss a little bit more on how you view the    their business in Europe positioning and the potential to take that banner, that e commerce banner, to the rest of Europe?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we believe Runners Point's Tredex operation, first of all, is best of class. It obviously is a significant part of their business. They have significant capabilities that will allow us to further develop our new Dot Com capability. We just started rolling out in most of the countries in Europe within the past year. They've been in place for several years. They also have a very good understanding, for example, of payment terms in Europe and Germany. There are 6 different ways that you can pay in Germany. We don't even have the capability for all of those within our current Foot Locker dot Germany operation. This will give us that capability to better serve the customer, to have better processing capabilities and expand to the other parts of our operations. So you are correct in picking up that Tredex is one of the important parts of the acquisition and one that we're very excited about using not only in Europe, but some of the ideas and things they do and bring that back to the States to further strengthen our good Dot Com position here.","Operator","And the next question is from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to start off in SG&A.  Ken or Lauren, could you just speak to the flexibility that you have in a scenario where comps, for the balance of the year, do fall short of your mid single digit view? If comps are only up, for example, low single digit, do you have enough flexibility, or would you be able to maybe moderate your plans for investments or remodels that you could still leverage? Or how should we think about that?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we have said all along, Paul, that we can leverage low single digit comps. We do have flexibility as we see the trends to make adjustments, and there are number of different things that we can adjust, ranging from store labor to what we're doing in terms of receipts, resulting markdowns to marketing. So we have flexibility. One of the issues we had at the end of January was, as you know, not just for us, but for all of retail, the precipitous drop the last 2 weeks of January. It's more difficult to adjust. But we feel we have the flexibility to adjust and work very hard to control our expenses. We're very proud we had the lowest expense rate in our history this last quarter, and that's something that Lauren does an outstanding    and her team do an outstanding job monitoring. That said, we still believe, looking at the product that's out there and the things that we have coming, that we're going to achieve mid single digit sales growth. Lauren, I don't know if you have any...","Lauren B. Peters","No, I think you've covered it. I mean, we remained focused on profitability and keep a close eye on the top line, and we adjust where we can with that move.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And one May commentary that you made, there are some changes in the release calendar this month. I know that the Retro Jordan product, for example, are coming out tomorrow versus coming out a week earlier last year. I mean, how meaningful do you think that is to the flat comp and deceleration from April? And what are the other kind of factors that you think may have driven this slowdown?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, there's no question that just as a    in the department store industry have shifted the sale one way or the other, the shift of a release for us has an impact. And particularly, when it's a significant shoe because you're talking a few million dollars here, a few million dollars there, make a big difference in what the comps are. The other thing    and it's not an excuse for lack of sales, it's an excuse for the    or it's a reality of a shift of sales because we believe the customers will buy apparel when the weather is right. It's been cooler. We did a very good job getting out of fleece in the spring season. So we don't have a lot of fleece, but we got a lot of t shirts and shorts. People aren't quite wearing them. You're in New York today, and you know that the high today and tomorrow is going into be in the low 60s. In Europe, it's been in the 50s. That doesn't    I'm not putting that as an excuse to why we haven't sale. What I'm saying is, it's a reason while the sales have shifted somewhat. And we expect to get those sales back, and we're in good shape. And where we have seen the weather warm up, such as places like Vegas, where it's in the 90s, the customers out there and they're buying the products. So we know the product is right. It's just getting the conditions right, and we anticipate picking up.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one quickly. Ken, could you just speak to the overall women's footwear trends across the industry so we can kind of understand what the spread is overall versus the business you're seeing in Ladies Foot Locker? Because if they're not shopping there, where do you think that that customer is primarily purchasing their athletic goods? And you also spoke about the larger Lady Foot Locker stores outperforming. What is the composition of large versus smaller Lady Foot Locker?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we    well, a couple of things. One, there's 2 basic things that we're seeing going on in the women's business. One is that the performance business, things like running and training shoes, are doing well for us. There are some fashion elements that are doing well, like the wedges. In athletic shoes, from Nike and Reebok, Adidas, and those are 2 different customers. What we've done in our business is we shifted Lady Foot Locker to more    a more performance customer. By doing that, we fire the customer that was there, who was primarily a fashion customer. We are now sending her to our Foot Locker and Champs stores. And they are coming. And up until this quarter, they bought    our business in those stores was actually up compared to the Lady Foot Locker stores. And if you remember, we've said for up until this quarter, again, our women's business overall was up. It was the Lady Foot Locker business that was down. This quarter, I think that one of the things that happened is we probably didn't have enough of the fashion in Foot Locker to satisfy that fashion customer, and that's something that we are working feverishly to address. What    in the larger stores and the re skinned Lady Foot Locker stores, we have made a major effort for the new customer to find and see what we are, and we're starting to see that customers finding us and coming in. In the basic Lady Foot Locker stores, it's a little more difficult because we don't have the room and haven't shown the apparel, which is really the signal to that customer that this store is more performance oriented. We    the good news is, we're seeing where we put the apparel in in a significant way, in those re skinned stores and in our SIX:02 stores.  They're starting to perform better and we    and that shows that we're on the right track. We've got to make adjustments to that assortment because we're finding the customer is buying the product differently than we had initially thought they would buy it. But we are making that transition. I would say that, right now, in the women's business, they aren't exactly    in the fashion side, they're not moving as aggressively as they had been in the past.  They're probably moving into other shoes. But I think as we get the right shoes, we'll be positioned well.","Lauren B. Peters","And Paul, you asked about the count of those larger SIX:02. There are 3 of those, and we've got 14 of what we call re skinned Lady Foot Lockers. So that's 17 doors of 282.","Operator","And the next question is from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was just wondering if maybe you could give us the traffic and ticket in the first quarter?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, certainly, ASPs were a part of the story. They were strong, up in footwear, up further in apparel. Traffic was down a bit.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- I'm curious in the May trends. Is there any -- can you give any color between what's happening international or Europe versus the domestic operation in that May thought process?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, the business in total is a little bit healthier in Europe right now. We've seen there's some nice bounce-backs. Ken referred to some of the temperature challenges. But again, I think the product that's in both markets is right. So as we push through into -- get closer to summer, I think that both businesses are in good shape.","Kenneth C. Hicks","The Europe business, Chris, is actually brick-and-mortar, one of our better businesses right now. The team is doing a good job responding to what the customer wants. And you heard Dick's comment about Runners Point, who is primarily in Germany, where -- which is the strongest economy and one of the things that we're going to take advantage of by having a bigger -- largest country if the deal closes.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's good to hear. Just to clarify, I mean, I know a lot of people are going to be concerned about the comp to date trend line. But as we've seen in the past, when a product is relevant, the customer does come into your stores and shop. I mean, I guess, give us some just points as to why you feel so confident that you're going to return back to mid-single digits. I mean, obviously, the calendar shift has some impact. But I was just wondering maybe if you could elaborate about that, about your comfort level. So that early in the first quarter when that happened, probably, you're going to see it again, but just give some investors some comfort.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Chris, I think that when you look at the business, the advantage we have, obviously, is we've seen the product coming, and we also know what's selling and what's not selling. There are a number of different things. One, some of the big ideas that are coming, more Flyknits from Nike, more Boosts from Adidas, the sling...","Richard A. Johnson","SpringBlade.","Kenneth C. Hicks","SpringBlade. Well, I keep on calling it sling blade, which is not a good way. SpringBlade from Adidas is going to be a big hit coming. The colors that we've got in the store and that we got coming are selling extremely well. More technical performance. The launches that we have coming up, we've got a nice lineup of launches coming, all of those things in the shoe business. The second thing is that in the past, our apparel significantly outpaced our shoe business. This quarter, it didn't, and we're positioned well with apparel. We get a little bit of break where people will start wearing the shorts and more of the T-shirts we have because we don't have the fleece to sell them. When we did have the fleece the last couple of quarters, we did very well with it. We sold out of it. We did what we're supposed to do. We're clean. We go for the expected weather. We don't try to say it should be this or it should be that. All we want is it to be what's expected. That will help because then our apparel business will pick up. So there are a number of things, if I look at in shoes and look at in apparel, that give me optimism about this quarter and quite frankly, for the rest of the year. You guys know us well enough to know that we're not going to step out and promise the world. We're going to say pretty sure of what we can deliver. We feel good about the mid-single digits. If things work out better, things work out better. But unlike when some people write things and actually mean something else, when we say what we say, we mean it.","Operator","And the next question is from Kate McShane from Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just with all the initiatives that you have in place, I was wondering if you could walk us through where you'll be with each of your remodels for each banner this year, so what percentage you'll be through. And can you talk about how much of a comp lift you get after you remodel a store?","Richard A. Johnson","I'll take you through, Kate, from the Kids Foot Locker numbers I mentioned will be -- over 20% of those doors will have been touched. We'll be around the 10% level on the Foot Locker chain and will be closer to 15% on the Champs chain. And no, we haven't talked about the comp lift that we get after those remodels. They continue to meet the hurdles that we've got from a capital perspective, but we haven't commented on the comp performance.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We have our hurdle rates. And as Dick said in his call, all of the remodels were projected to exceed those hurdle rates.","Lauren B. Peters","Which are 11% ROIC, 13% IRR.","Kenneth C. Hicks","And they are exceeding that exceed. This is what Dick said in his comments. And so we're -- right now, we're happy with the results of the remodels. The challenge that we had this past quarter was particularly for the Champs stores. They're closed for several weeks to do the remodel, and we didn't have any stores that have been remodeled that were providing the additional growth to make up for the ones that were closed. And that -- when you close a number of stores for several weeks, that has an impact. But what will start happening now is the ones that have been remodeled will help offset for the ones that are closed as we start to move through this process. That was the way we had planned it. But the first batch, we didn't have the benefit.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question was just your commentary on apparel in Europe, that it was a little bit weaker. Can you remind us what the mix of apparel and footwear is in Europe compared to that of the U.S.?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We have not said the percent. Totally, in the U.S. or across the company, we're at about 24%. But Europe has a higher percentage of apparel penetration than the rest of the company, and it's been more challenging there. And we continue to make adjustments to improve that.","Operator","And the next question is from Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess, Ken, for you, as we think about the strength in the Kids business, I want you to just sort of speak to, again, what exactly is driving that. And is that, in any way, an indication -- again, just I -- I hate to use the word cycle, but as we go through the innovation pipeline that's occurred over the last couple of years on the men's side of that business and, perhaps, the trickle down to now the Kids business, maybe just frame for us how we should be thinking about that process.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, I don't -- and again, we have the cycle and trend. I don't think this is necessarily cycle. I think this is the trend that's here. Those people with kids, their kids aren't wearing any brown shoes. They're all wearing sneakers all the time. And so that opens up the opportunity for us, and we are the place to go for quality kids sneakers. There's not another place that has the assortment that we do, either in our Kids stores or in our Kids assortments in all of our other banners. And what we're seeing there is the brands are doing an excellent job in, one, making sure that they have kid-friendly, fun shoes, and we're seeing a lot of those. Dick mentioned the Crayola line from Converse, for example, but also the Takedowns. There is a huge \"I want to look like daddy\" or \"I want to look like big brother\" business, and so...","Lauren B. Peters","Or \"I want to wear what my hero's wearing.\"","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, \"I want to wear what my hero's wearing.\" And so we are seeing a significant Takedown business. And then, at the bigger sizes, there's a fair bit of performance and women who are buying those shoes, young women or men, for that matter, with small feet. So it's really the brands doing a great job adjusting or recognizing this trend. For example, Nike just appointed a new person to run their kids initiatives. That's one of the leaders in the company because they recognize it, and the other people are doing the same thing. But this is a -- there's not a vendor we deal with that doesn't recognize this as a significant opportunity, and we're benefiting.","Lauren B. Peters","And I would say our team has also done a really good job of adding apparel to those stores. And when you got a strong apparel offering, it helps those shoes.","Kenneth C. Hicks","And that's one -- if you look at the new remodeled Kids stores, what we've done in the remodel is really make a major apparel play. And as, again, Dick said, that apparel is up significantly more than the shoes. And the stores that haven't been remodeled yet, we've taken steps to put more apparel in until we get around to the remodel. So there are a number of things happening. The other thing, in the accessory area. We've put in hats and more socks. So this is something that, to some degree, have been a neglected business that's really now just getting the attention, and I see it continuing for quite some time.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then I guess my second question, you guys have done a great job of managing inventories. Maybe speak to the competitive landscape in the mall, obviously, when your key competitors, they're doing a partnership with a department store, just the -- and sort of the view of the landscape and any potential threat of cannibalization or too much products in the mall. Is the segmentation right? I know, at the end of the day, whoever's got the best products is going to take share. But maybe just tell us on the developments in the mall.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, I think here, the brands have done a very good job making sure that they manage their brands well. And they will continue to do that, make sure that they don't damage the brands by putting the product in the wrong places or letting the product get ahead of the market too much. That said, we have to keep an eye on what's going on there. We believe that the customer who is buying in our stores and stores like ours will continue to do that. Somebody else may be cannibalizing their own business by expanding the outlets they have. I'm not sure that will necessarily impact us because of the product that they're talking about, but we will definitely keep an eye on it. And I think our history has shown that Dick and Lauren together have done a very good job managing those inventories and keeping them in line with the business.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just my last question regarding the Runners Point acquisition. It looks like, at least on a price basis, kind of a really nice deal here. And given the comps, given the growth opportunities, you mentioned that it's a profitable business and expected to be accretive. But is there any way to give a little bit more color on the operating margin structure of that business relative to Foot Locker and, I guess, dealing with some of the opportunities?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I give Dick, Lauren, Gary Bahler, our General Counsel, Luke Kimball [ph] and all the people involved on the negotiation doing a hell of a good job negotiating when you look at what we got for the price. That said, it's a -- we are going through a legal process in Germany, and we don't own them yet. And so it's a little difficult for -- not a little difficult. We can't comment a lot on the details.","Operator","And the next question is from Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the gross margin line, kind of the differential between occupancy leverage and merch margin. It looks like they both contributed a little bit this quarter, but it sounds like more of the kind of gross margin gains in the future seem like they're going to be coming from leverage rather than merch margin. Can you talk about the merch margin dynamics there and what's changing? Obviously, you've done a great job on that front the last few years and have seen huge gains. But are we kind of getting towards the end of the road there, or is there still opportunity on the merch margin side?","Lauren B. Peters","Let me reiterate what we saw in the first quarter. It was 20 basis points in our margin overall. We had 20 basis points improvement in the merchandise margin. We got 10 basis points leverage out of the fixed cost, and we gave back 10 basis points in lower shipping and handling revenue. So yes, we do -- on a mid-single digit, we get leverage opportunity out of the margin. And as we've said, we continue to think that that's what the balance of the year looks like on the top line, so we would expect leverage. But that shipping and handling revenue doesn't go away, that pressure point. And we've got continued pressure point out of lower IMU, although that's certainly at lower levels of pressure than what we've seen last year. But we do still have opportunity in underlying merchandise margin. We're making investments in systems that help us do a better job of allocating the product. And the better we are at allocating it to the right place the first time around, the more full-priced selling you get. So that helps the merchandise margins. And we have said more than once that long term, we really feel very good about the opportunity for apparel to become a higher percentage of our business. And that, one day, the margins in apparel should outpace the footwear margins. What we've been doing for the last couple of years is lower promotional levels overall have meant that gross margin and footwear has been improving at the same as apparel, so they haven't consistently crossed yet with apparel over footwear. So I guess what I'd tell you is that merchandise margin opportunity, the fruit's higher up in the tree, but it's still there, and we think we can get it.","Operator","And the next question is from Sam Poser from Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","When do you foresee the RPG deal closing?","Lauren B. Peters","It should be -- there is -- depending on when merger control review completes. But it should be this summer, July, August.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you give us -- you said you're running flat for the month of May. Can you tell us sort of what the shifted comp would have been, how we should think about the shifted comp by quarter or for the month of May from last year, so what you're up against but on the same calendar?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We've done the quarter, but we haven't done the month.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So could you give us what the shifted quarter would -- what the shifted Q2 and Q3 look like?","Lauren B. Peters","Okay. So again, we go back to the guidance that we gave and what this 53rd week shift is all about. For the second quarter, we pick up a strong week of August, drop off a week of May. So that's worth about $40 million historically of sales moving into second quarter.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","But that doesn't affect the comp. That affects the sales. So you see what I'm saying? I mean, so the point is that you had a -- whatever the comp was last year, you had a good comp in Q2 last year, but that comp is on a different calendar. So my question is what -- you ran a 9.8% comp last year for the quarter starting on April 29 and going through July 28. This year, it's a week later. So on a shifted basis, what is the actual comp for those weeks that you're up against? Does that make sense? I understand the $40 million move. I'm trying to figure out what the comp, what the actual comp you're up against is because -- is it a more difficult comp in Q3 than it is in -- or Q2 than it is in Q3 and so on, so make sure we...","Kenneth C. Hicks","It is a more difficult comp in Q3 than Q2.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","In Q3 than Q2, okay.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. Q3 is our most challenged quarter this year.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. So it's a bit stronger, as Ken said, on a shifted basis, what that comp would have been last year. But we still think mid-single digit, and that's true by quarter.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you think the variance won't be that great, but you do have a little more opportunity in Q4 because of that -- the horrible last 10 days?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. So what happens, you have the shift of the money, but the shift to the comp is comparable.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one last thing, Dick, how many stores by banner have you touched year-to-date so far in the remodels?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, we haven't gotten into the specific numbers by banners, Sam, because project start and finish...","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","How many are done? How many are completed, I guess?","Richard A. Johnson","Total real estate...","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, we completed 64 remods in the first quarter. We will do a chunk more in the second quarter. We reached a peak in the third quarter. But again, not all remods are the same for time -- closure time, if you will.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's why I wanted to know how many are done by banner, so we can sort of get an idea. We know how many you're doing, just so we get an idea...","Kenneth C. Hicks","The first quarter is our second light. The fourth quarter is our lightest by far. The second quarter's second lightest. The heaviest is completed in the third quarter, and the second quarter is the second heaviest. The challenge, as Dick said, particularly with Champs, is some carryover from quarter-to-quarter.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And next year, assuming these work, that number will go higher theoretically?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We would anticipate continuing the process. And if our ability is to do more, we would do more. We want to see what our ability is. It's one of the reasons we got what we've got.","Operator","And the next question is from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So just to follow up on the last question. I think what we're all trying to get a handle on is just to understand what the main driver was between the April comp of high-single digits versus the flat comp in May and maybe to highlight some of the moving parts around that. Because it seems like you've had some good product that's been favorable, understanding that apparel has not been, given the weather. Just if you could help us understand the differences between what's product-related, what's been weather-related, what's remodel-related, I think that'd be incredibly useful.","Kenneth C. Hicks","All of the elements impact, and for us to say that it's a little bit of this, a little bit of that is very difficult. All of the elements impacted. May is the lowest month in the first half of the year. It's our smallest month in the first half of the year. And it has started off slower for all of the reasons that you just said and other things. We were fortunate we had a strong April. Looking at the pipelines, the things we have coming, we feel confident that we will be in the -- able to recover from the -- because of May. Remember, February, when we talked last time, that was our -- that's the biggest month in the first half of the year. And we recovered from that because, as we said, we saw the product and we knew what we had coming. It's a balance. It's one of the reasons why retailers are hesitant to give weekly or monthly results because things move for a variety of reasons. And you look at, we look at over a period of time. And you can't get too excited about a day, a big day up or a big day down. You have to look at it over the longer term. And we feel, as we said on the call, that we've got the tools and ammunition to make sure that we're going to deliver our guidance of mid-single-digit comps.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Are there regional differences in terms of your stores that would explain away some of those -- the volatility trends that you just described, so in other words, try to pinpoint some of the more things that are relevant to the business?","Kenneth C. Hicks","As I said earlier, that where the weather is warmer, we're performing somewhat better because we're getting some better results with some of the apparel. But there are other conditions that impact that, too, like what the economy may be or a team, a basketball team winning or losing. And so it's difficult to say this one thing impacted the business. I'm not trying to be difficult with you. I'm just saying that on a theoretical basis, you can go back and add it up. But on an actual basis, it's -- everything interacts, whether -- so we're just -- we look at what we've got coming. We've looked at what we've done. We feel that the customer, for the first couple of weeks of May, didn't just all of a sudden quit buying. They didn't all call each other and say, \"We're not going to buy.\" There were other things that we did and that happened externally that impacted that, but they will come back.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And then just to think about the quarter-to-quarter progression on the comps, if you're thinking mid-single digits for the year, is there some sort of lumpiness between Q2 and Q4 that we should be contemplating, or is that -- should we expect that to be fairly linear?","Lauren B. Peters","It's fairly linear.","Operator","And the next question is from Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ken, I'm going to give you a break on the comp question. I want to shift gears to flow-through. So the past couple of years, you guys have spoiled us with 30% to 40% rates of flow-through, yet these past 6 months have been a little bit more challenged, 19% in the fourth quarter, 23% this quarter. It sounds like there's some unique events taking place there. I guess, A, is that fair? And B, assuming that you do deliver on the mid-single-digit comp, which it sounds like you should be able to, how do we think about the rate of flow-through going forward?","Lauren B. Peters","I have to correct you on -- first quarter is 27% flow-through and, I guess, certainly better than Q4, where we've described what happened in Q4, where it dropped off at the end. And if it drops off right at the end, you're somewhat limited in what you can pull back.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We also, in the fourth quarter, as Lauren said, we had the charge, which we did not call out for -- because we were negotiating on doing the Runners Point. But the first quarter was -- or the fourth quarter was...","Lauren B. Peters","Kind of tough. But first quarter, we had margin rate expansion, expanding both on gross margin and our SG&A with the 27%.","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, despite the 53rd week shift that's limited that.","Lauren B. Peters","But we remain very focused on flow-through and incremental -- we can leverage at low single-digits, and we do well on anything above that.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess maybe asked another way, the $20 million worth of sales that you lost in the first quarter, I mean, how meaningful do you think that would have been to EPS?","Lauren B. Peters","I mean, you can do the math off of $20 million. But we, as an objective, sales above plan, we're trying to hit a 35% flow-through rate.","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, we delivered the sales expectations and beat the earnings expectations that were out there. Now if there were some that were out there that weren't out public, I can't -- I have difficulty knowing what that is. But we feel that, particularly looking at the competitive set that is recently reported, our sales and earnings are above those. And it was something the team feels is a good accomplishment. Was it as good as what we would have liked? No, we're never satisfied, but it's...","Lauren B. Peters","We're very focused on productivity, which is the reason that we continue to look at underperforming stores. Our desire is to get those performing, so they remain part of the fleet. But we do what we need to do. When you close an underperforming locations, that lifts our productivity rate overall. We are focused on sales per square foot. We are focused on sales per payroll hour. And in fact, we've been investing in systems that help us do a really good job of getting, selling hours on the floor right and matching those up to peak periods that improves that productivity further. So we do remain focused on that and improving the rate.","Operator","And the last question will be from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is there something structurally different on the buying and occupancy line here? If I just look back through the model, it seems like, potentially, in the past, we get a little higher leverage from a 5% comp.","Lauren B. Peters","Well, increasing occupancy remains a dynamic, so as we commit to projects, right, you're putting capital into doors where we have extended lease life. So that adds occupancy dollars.","Kenneth C. Hicks","It adds occupancy. The other thing, Michael, I think that a couple of years ago, when we were closing -- when we had more nonproductive stores to close...","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, that's also a factor.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We obviously benefited more. Now, as more stores are more productive, it becomes more challenging. That said, we still have stores to close. It's demonstrated by the fact we're going to close over 100 stores this year. And all of those doors, when we close them, will improve our productivity and performance.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I know we've beat this to death, but I want to just ask one question on help of remodeling for a second here. Can you -- just around clarifying some of the comments you made on the math around the store you had off-line as you started the remodels in the quarter, those stores in the math come out of the comp base for a period and how that impacts the comp sales number as they come back in, if so. I'm just -- in particular, I'm looking at -- I think you said, Lauren, that the peak of the remodels will be in the third quarter. And then I think, Ken, you said that that was also your toughest comparison quarter, so I want to make sure we get the cadence correct.","Kenneth C. Hicks","No, the store is in the comp the whole time, even the close period.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes.","Kenneth C. Hicks","So we're dark a -- for the weeks that it's closed. The thing that happened in the first quarter that, as we go along, will be different is that in the first quarter, we didn't have any stores that we remodeled in the fourth quarter the prior year that have the higher-than-average pickup. So what happens is you develop a layering. I'm closed, but I've got some stores remodeled that will help cover those closed stores. And as you go through and get that layering, the impact of the stores that are closed gets less. And that's why, quite frankly, we haven't made a big deal of it because over time, it should -- it will work out to be neutral. In the first quarter, more of an impact because we didn't have some higher-performing stores to offset the ones that were closed. It's a part of what we're doing. And when we did the -- we do the analysis for the remodels, we understand and recognize we count the downtime and we recognize what that is in, and that's in the returns that we have to come up with. So it's an anomaly for the first couple of quarters until we get a number that are delivering at that higher rate, and they will offset the ones that are closed to some degree. It's also another reason why we -- people said, \"Why don't you just remodel the whole chain at once?\" People would probably question us getting down 400, 500 stores for 6 weeks in a year.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, you might have a 2-week period that you're not flat, for God's sake. So if I could just close with one little step back on Lady Foot Locker here, you've been through a few soul-searching periods with that change since you've been there. It sounds like you're still hustling to crack the code. But all the while, you've been reducing the store count into that. I mean, how do you think about managing that dynamic from here, where we are today? Do you, at this point, have any kind of confidence, as you've mentioned some of the reopened stores has been better, that longer term, you can slow down the door closures?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, I think what we're seeing and what will happen -- and one of the reasons why not exactly fighting the store closures, is the stores that we're closing aren't the right size going forward. They're shoe-driven stores, and they're smaller stores. They don't have enough space for apparel. And that, we know, is the real key to this business. And so we're going to have to switch over anyway on many of those stores. There are some we won't, as we said, with the reskinned stores. But we're going to have to close those stores and put up a new -- get a new space anyway. So closing it now, if it's not delivering effectively, isn't necessarily a bad thing. The important thing is that we're learning all about what selling, space allocation, the brands that work, the type of product and...","Lauren B. Peters","What sells with what to present a collection.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Presentation, the selling skills required. We're learning a tremendous amount. And the good news that we've got is that we're seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. Now people look and say, geez, why haven't you got it yet? I don't think -- I could be wrong, but I don't think Lululemon had 150 stores 8 months after they opened. And it takes a while to get it right. We're going to get it right, and then we're going to expand it. And we can move aggressively. We've got the capability to move aggressively. And I guarantee the landlords are very interested in this succeeding because they see this as a void in the market. The vendors are very interested in growing this aggressively. And this is something -- when we look at Kids now and the performance of Kids 2 or 3 years now, we're going to be talking about women's the same way and the performance of women's. And that's what we're looking at, is getting that right so we have the next level of significant growth opportunity that we can move forward on and layer that on. And so it just doesn't -- while we're talking about it, is this a Kids cycle or not a Kids cycle, is it women's cycle?  We've built a layer merchandising, a layer of business that will go on and we'll be able to build on for the long term.","John A. Maurer","That's all we have time for.

As reported in today's press release, the company reported fourth quarter net income of $158 million compared to a $49 million loss for the 14-week fourth quarter last year.","On a GAAP basis, this year's fourth quarter net income was $1.39 per share compared to a loss of $0.40 per share for the 14-week period last year. Included in these results is a pretax impairment charge of $19 million or $80 million after tax related primarily to Runners Point and Sidestep and a $1 million charge related to the pension matter we have previously disclosed.","In addition, there were two large items affecting our tax expense, a $4 million write down in our deferred tax assets due to a change in Dutch tax rates, largely offset by $4 million tax benefit related to the U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in late 2017 as detailed in today's press release.","A year ago, the fourth quarter included the following; a $128 million pre-tax charge or $81 million after tax for the pension matter. Pre-tax impairment charges totaling $20 million related to write downs of certain 602 and Runners Point Group assets.","And tax items that totaled $109 million of expense, largely related to tax reform. Excluding these items, on a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter earnings were $1.56 per share versus last year's $1.26 per share on a 14-week basis.","Last year\u2019s extra week produced earnings of $0.12 per share thus resulting in a 13-week non GAAP EPS of $1.14. Lastly, the 2018 full year 52-week non-GAAP earnings were $4.71 per share compared to $4.11 for the 53-week prior year.","Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, earnings were $3.99 per share. Unless otherwise noted, the figures and rates mentioned during the call today will be based on non-GAAP results and for comparability; they will exclude the 53rd week impact from 2017.","The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in today's press release. We'll begin our prepared remarks with Lauren Peters, Foot Locker\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will provide details on our fourth quarter financial results along with our financial outlook for fiscal 2019.","Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will provide highlights from our fourth quarter performance along with an update on a recent strategic investments and our early thoughts on 2019.","As a reminder, last month we announced that we will be hosting an Investor Meeting here in New York on March 28, at which time we will lay out our strategic priorities, growth initiatives and long term financial objectives.","Therefore, during today's Q&A we would ask that you focus your questions on the fourth quarter results and the outlook for 2018. With that, I'll now turn it over to Lauren.","Lauren Peters","Thank you, Jim. Good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a very strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2018. We were able to improve on the top line momentum that we had built throughout the year, posting a 9.7% comparable sales gain.","Including the fourth quarter results, our total sales for the year were $7.9 billion, a 3.3% increase over last year\u2019s 52-week result of $7.7 billion. Comparable sales were positive throughout the quarter. November was up mid-single digits. December with incredible product heat and excitement during the holiday season was up double digits.","January was up high single digits. Average selling prices were up double digits. Traffic was down low single digits overall with trends in North America better than international. In regard to channel, we delivered strong performances across stores and digital, across our geographies.","As a group, our stores posted a 5.7% comparable sales increase, while our digital channels delivered a 29.7% comp gain. As a percent of total sales, DTC increased to 19.1% for the quarter, up from 16.1% a year ago.","Our North American divisions all posted positive sales results. We saw impressive performances from East Bay, Foot Locker U.S. and Foot Locker, Canada with each banner posting double digit comp gains. Champs also delivered a strong performance, up high single digit.","Kid's Foot Locker was up mid-single digits and Foot Action posted a low single digit comp gain. Internationally, our Foot Locker Pacific business had a terrific quarter, generating a double digit sales gain.","Our Foot Locker Europe business continued to improve and was up high single digits, while Sidestep was down mid-single digits, and Runners Point decreased double digits. My family of business, footwear posted the strongest sales gain, up double digits overall in the quarter. Men's and women's footwear were both up double digits, while kids was up high single digits.","By category, men's running and classic styles posted strong double digit gains, while men's basketball was down mid-single digits. Our apparel business continues to perform well posting a mid-single digit increase with gains driven by strong sales of branded tees and fleece from Champion, Nike and -- NBA apparel led by Lakers apparel, also sold through at good rates.","Our children's apparel business was up strong double digit. Our men's apparel posted a mid-single digit gain, while women's was down low single digits, The trends that we saw throughout the year in our accessories business continued in Q4, with gains in bags more than offset by decreases in half from socks, resulting in a double digit comp sales decline.","Moving down the income statement to gross margin. We produced an excellent 160 basis point improvement in the quarter to 32.4% of sales from 30.8% a year ago. This improvement was evenly split between merchandised margins and leverage on our relatively fixed buyer and occupancy expenses.","The 80 basis points from increased merchandised margin were due primarily to lower markdowns across footwear, apparel and accessories. While all families of business contributed to the margin lift, apparel margins improved more than footwear margins in the quarter, and actually surpassed them.","This consistent improvement in our apparel performance points to the great work by our apparel team and strong collaboration with our vendor partners. For the full year, our gross margin improved by 40 basis points to 31.8% better than the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.","Our SG&A rate increased by 70 basis points to 19.9% in the quarter, below the 100 basis point to 120 basis point increase we guided to on our last call. Our team did a good job managing our expenses during the quarter and flowing through the stronger top line sales.","For the full year, SG&A came in at 20.3% up 100 basis points from 2017\u2019s rate. The higher spend reflects the investments we made in our digital capabilities and logistics, and higher incentive compensation. Incentive compensation was about 50 basis points of the increase.","Depreciation expense decreased slightly this quarter to $45 million from $46 million a year ago. For the full year, depreciation and amortization increased 3% to $178 million due to the ongoing investments in our stores, digital on supply chain capabilities, and improvements and other infrastructure.","Our fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 27.3% below last year's Q4 rate and in line with our expected run rate.","Altogether, the fourth quarter was marked by an improving top and bottom line resulting in an impressive non-GAAP net income of $177 million, an increase of 27% over Q4, 2017. And non-GAAP net income of $547 million for the full year, a 7% increase over last year.","During the quarter, we repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares for approximately $62 million bringing our full year total to 7.8 million shares at a cost of $375 million. We also returned $158 million of cash to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend in 2018, which brought our total return to shareholders for the year to $533 million.","As we announced in February, our board increased our quarterly dividend payout rate to $0.38 per share and authorized a new three year $1.2 billion share repurchase program. We invested $187 million through our capital expenditure program in 2018, and funded $89 million of the $124 million to strategic investments that were announced during the year.","I\u2019ll let Dick cover the details of those investments in a moment, but suffice it to say that even with funding our internal initiatives as well as capitalizing on new strategic opportunities, we ended the year in a strong financial position with $767 million of cash net of balance sheet debt.","Further, taken together, these actions demonstrate our confidence in Foot Locker's ability to continue to build upon the momentum of 2018, invest for the long term growth of the company and deliver enhanced returns to shareholders.","Before I hand the call over to Dick, I'll take a moment to review our inventory, which is fresh and increasingly productive.","At actual FX rate inventory ended the quarter down 0.7% compared to the 7.4% total sales increase. Using constant currencies, our inventory increased 1.3% within our standard when compared to the 8.8% total sales increase.","This outstanding inventory performance combined with a strong top line results allowed us to increase inventory turns and ultimately achieve a turn greater than our long term target of three times.","Increasing inventory productivity has been a company focus, and I can't say enough how proud I am of the team for the hard work and dedication it took to achieve this goal. Hurray! We did it. Well done. And with that brief moment of celebration, I'll now turn the call over to Dick, but I'll be back in a bit to provide you with our initial guidance for 2019.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Lauren and good morning everyone. I want to begin my remarks by recognizing all of the associates whose dedication to us, to the success of our company and whose passion for creating incredible experiences for our customers, wherever, and whenever they interact with us led to the stellar results Lauren just described.","And to the momentum, we see in our business as we begin 2019. I am proud to be able to report the top and bottom line results met the high end of our expectations as we laid them out for you at the beginning of the year. With a comparable sales increase of 2.7% for fiscal 2018, total revenues reached $7.9 billion, a new record in our history as Footlocker Inc.","And we were able to achieve non-GAAP earnings of $4.71 per share, an increase of 18% over the 52-week equivalent in 2017. In addition, as Lauren mentioned, we finished with an inventory turnover above our long term goal of more than three times. This is a meaningful accomplishment we have been working on for some time and a testament to our continuing focus on driving further productivity gains.","In the next few minutes, I will touch on some of the drivers that fueled the business and the progress we made on several key initiatives. I will then give some color around our recently announced strategic investments and highlight some of the early energy from the NBA All-Star game.","After that, I will turn the call back over to Lauren to update you on our outlook for 2019. Taking a look at our fourth quarter performance, the strong growth in footwear was fueled by the strength of a marquee business that is more diverse than ever, with a great mix of running and basketball styles.","This included YEEZY from Adidas, a strong Jordan business and the continuing demand for Max Air. In addition, the strong performance in our women's and apparel businesses combined with the breadth and depth of exciting products from brands such as Fila, Vans and Champion as well as the addition of lifestyle brands such as UGG illustrates the great work our team has done to extend the reach of our company.","As I did last quarter, I want to tell you about some of the things we are doing to share the excitement and energy of sneaker culture with people around the world. We are doing this in close collaboration with our strategic vendor partners and together, we continued to deliver great products with elevated storytelling and locally relevant experiences.","With Nike, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the iconic \u2018Tuned Air\u2019 silhouette, and exclusive to our Foot Locker Inc. Family. The fourth quarter also included the Home and Away collection, which focused on the vibrant sneaker communities of Houston, Atlanta and Miami.","New iterations of the campaign will continue in early 2019, providing an opportunity to take pride in what makes each city unique. With Adidas, we partnered on the launch of their new \u201cAsterisk Collective\u201d an exclusive to Foot Locker that launched with the 90s inspired TRESC Run.","This community focused campaign brought together six celebrity creators, and illustrated how each aim to make a difference in their respective communities through unique initiatives. For example Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes engaged in sports related events like viewing parties at local hospitals, while musician Kid Cudi helped kids experience healing through music, art, and design.","An exciting program launched during the quarter was the bringing together of two iconic brands, Timberland and Champion with a footwear and apparel collection that connected our customers with the brand's history and ties to music.","Foot Locker celebrated the launch with NBA player, Lance Stephenson and comedian Remy debating how the collaboration came to life. In another exclusive concept, Foot Locker partnered with Puma to release its 1980s inspired our RX platform with the toys and transformers collections during the holiday season.","At our 34th Street Flagship, we transformed our Puma lab into a transformers theme, while the Optimus Prime truck visited our Marble Arch power store in London.","We also announced the next phase of our strategic relationship with Adidas. Together, we created a revolutionary initiative powered by the Adidas Speedfactory that allows us to get closer to market and deliver Adidas made for shoes created from local and cultural insights. An exciting example of this was the launch of the AM4 Detroit, a new shoe designed by Detroit native, Kayla Donaldson. At the opening of our store, on Detroit's historic Eight Mile Road, our first iteration of a Power Store in North America.","This store offers full family shopping with a woman Shop-in-Shop and Kids Foot Locker and brings together the excitement of local sneaker culture, art, music and sport. It features Detroit specific products, for example, pair of Detroit inspired Home and Away Air Force Ones, custom art from Detroit artist Desiree Kelly and it has a dedicated space for events and activations for the sneaker obsessed consumer.","At the end of the quarter, we opened our second North America Power Store outside of Philadelphia, and now have five power stores open across the globe. We expect to open more than a dozen additional power stores in 2019 including new locations in Los Angeles, New York and Milan.","2018 was also a distinctive year for us as we invested $124 million into some innovative young companies at the forefront of change in our industry. We've talked on several calls now about the need to evolve with our consumer. We believe these investments will help us do just that, by opening opportunities to leverage innovative technologies, access new business segments and creative talent and expand the breadth of products and brands that we offer.","And ultimately create a richer ecosystem for our customers that deepens their emotional connections to our brands. I will start with GOAT, a $100 million investment in this premier sneaker marketplace is truly a game changer for our industry.","GOAT\u2019s co-founders Eddy Lu and Daishin Sugano have created a platform that in a very short time has captivated sneaker culture. Together, the power of our global store footprint combined with GOAT\u2019s digital capabilities will enable us to expand the sneaker ecosystem and create unmatched experience and engagement.","We enter this partnership understanding the greater responsibility that it comes with and are absolutely committed to delivering incredible benefits for the broader sneaker community. We also invested in two innovative companies focused in the children's space. First we invested $3 million in Super Heroic, an exciting and differentiated kid\u2019s footwear brand. We are excited to collaborate with Jason Mayden, Super Heroics founder and a true visionary in the industry.","The opportunity to leverage Super Heroics connection to communities through inspiring kids to play is something that deeply connects with our core values as a company, and we are beginning the work of bringing Super Heroic to life in our Kids Foot Locker banner.","We also invested $12.5 million in \u201cRockets of Awesome\u201d a high quality children's apparel business. Rockets has done an amazing job with its digitally native shopping and subscription model. We are delighted to partner with Rachel Blumenthal and her team as we look to broaden our kids offering and unlock insights to connect more deeply with kids and moms and dads with products, loyalty, and experiences including shop- in-shops with exclusive Rockets of Awesome assortments in our Kids Foot Locker banner.","Next, we saw an opportunity to invest in the future of talent in the footwear industry. PENSOLE Footwear Design Academy led by D\u2019Wayne Edwards is helping to curate the future of our industry through education and design. Along with our vendor partners, Foot Locker and PENSOLE will collaborate a new educational programs along with the design and manufacturing of exclusive products for the Foot Locker Inc. Family of brands.","Shifting to a women's business, it's no secret that we've been on a mission to evolve and grow this important segment over the last several years. The impact, our female customer has on youth culture is undeniable and we continually evaluate the ways in which we can best serve her.","With that in mind, we made the decision to wind down a relatively small 602 banner over the coming months, to more sharply focus our resources on building the existing women's business in each of our core banners. We learned much from our 602 team's efforts, including that when we create unique experiences and dedicated women's spaces within our current store footprint she responds well and the spaces are highly productive.","That is our go-forward focus and will include in-store concepts, social, digital and community activations dedicated to her. In addition to these spaces, we will continue to nurture our investment in Carbon38.","In fact, we made an additional $10 million investment shortly after year-end. Katie Johnson and her team have done a great job building a strong luxury active wear brand with a loyal customer base. We are continuing to partner with her to further develop the business.","Of the many opportunities, we believe our strategic investment provides, perhaps the most exciting is the window into the broader women's consumer set Carbon38 serves, as we strive to accelerate and expand our connection with female shoppers.","We often talk about investing in the right companies, but what's equally if not more important is investing in the right people. Whether it's Eddy and Daishin at GOAT, Katie at Carbon38, Jason at Super Heroic, Rachel at Rockets of Awesome or D'Wayne at PENSOLE, I couldn't be more proud or excited for our company to partner with such high-quality and diverse group of entrepreneurs.","Our goal moving forward will be to empower their growth while harnessing the insights capabilities and innovation that can help shape our business for the future. Now the work of bringing these investments to life gets underway and our teams have many exciting things planned, some of which we'll share with you at our Investor Day on March 28.","Turning now to fiscal 2019 we see a lot of energy, product innovation, and exciting events for the coming year. It all began with this year's NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte and the extension of our hashtag because sneakers created the platform which involves sneaker enthusiasts, passionate sneaker designer Jerry Lorenzo and L.A. Lakers player Lance Stephenson.","The All-Star game brings together the excitement and passion of the sneaker obsessed at an annual celebration with sports music and style. To build on this energy, we took our House of Hoops, Courtside experience to this key basketball moment. We offered our customers access to exclusive footwear launches, player appearances, personalized footwear, as well as workshops and panel discussions. But we didn't stop there; we set up shop in the exclusive retail partner for Puma basketball in Charlotte.","Also in the first quarter, we will have four more cities of our Home & Away collection, the debut of Young Guns, the new Nike program, as well as all the energy around Air Max Smart.","We will also have another release from the Adidas \u201cAsterisk Collective\u201d and we will be launching exciting new concepts from Champion with mascots and Fila with, \u201cDisrupt your Future\u201d. And this is only the beginning of what is in store for 2019.","Lastly, in early February, we announced a realignment of our organization into three distinct geographic regions. EMEA, Asia Pacific and North America. This new structure better aligns our resources across our international businesses as we at the same time develop an infrastructure to support our expansion plan in Asia.","As part of the realignment, we announced some key organizational changes, highlighted by the appointment of Lew Kimble to Executive Vice President and CEO of Asia-Pacific and Vijay Talwar to Executive Vice President and CEO of EMEA. I would like to congratulate Lou and Vijay on their new roles.","Jake Jacobs will continue to lead our North American divisions. I again want to thank the entire team for the passion and dedication of the company and its performance. To the investment community, I look forward to seeing you at the end of this month when we come together for our Investor Day, where the management team and I will share with you in greater detail how we plan to drive the business forward, our updated long term goals and strategies, and how we are building an even deeper connection with our global customer base. Lauren, back to you.","Lauren Peters","Thanks Dick. We have indeed built momentum in our business, and are optimistic about our positioning as we begin 2019. We have a lot of opportunities to seize upon, to drive the business both in the near and long term. And we look forward to outlining the details of those initiatives later this month at our Investor Day.","But first, let's take a look at how we see the current year unfolding. Starting with the top line, for 2019, we believe, we can achieve a mid-single digit comparable sales gain, and a double-digit percentage earnings per share increase. But foreign currency is weaker now, relative to the U.S. dollar than they were at the same time last year.","Our total sales will have a slight headwind in the first half of the year. We are planning for an improvement in our gross margin rate of 20 basis points to 40 basis points for the full year, mostly driven by leverage of our buyer and occupancy cost. While we continue to work on initiatives that support full price, sell through and logistics efficiencies, our markdown rates are nearing personal best, hence our plans look for more from top line leverage.","For the on-going investments we are making in our digital capabilities, which come with both a capital and operating expense impact, our SG&A expense rate is expected to be up between 40 basis points to 60 basis points year-over-year. This annual SG&A guidance also incorporates all known minimum wage rate increases and continuing upward trends in health care costs.","Looking at our capital expenditures, we are now planning this year capital program to be $275 million. The higher capital spend this year reflects our intention to continue investing in ways to elevate the customer experience across our physical and digital touch points and to continue to invest in our supply chain and other infrastructure projects.","We plan to spend approximately $175 million to improve our store fleet in 2019, including 80 new stores with over a dozen new power stores, further expansion in Asia, and approximately 190 remodels or relocations of existing stores.","In addition, we plan to close about 165 stores. The store closures will be across our geographies with the greatest concentration in Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker in the U.S. 602, the Foot Locker and Runners Point in Europe.","There are also the investments in our digital customer experience and supply chain capabilities I mentioned, including investments and personalization, a reimagined membership program, the rollout of our global point of sale software platform and our international markets and the upgrade of our international websites to our new platform to name a few.","With this level of investment, we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $185 million in 2019. We are planning interest income to be relatively flat to the $9 million of income in 2018, and we are continuing to plan our effective tax rate to be approximately 27.5% in 2019.","Our guidance of a double digit percentage increase in earnings per share also assumes a lower share count, based on the continued opportunistic execution of our share repurchase program. Although we are planning a mid-single digit comp gain in each quarter, we are keeping an eye on the impact on the top line from the slower pace of checks refunds combined with the lower average refund size compared to a year ago.","Also the FX headwinds I mentioned will have the greatest impact on the first quarter. I think that covers the highlight of 2019. So, I\u2019ll end there and ask Shelby to open up the call to your questions.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the lines are now open.","Dick Johnson","Shelby, this is Dick. Before we get to the first question, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Jon Epstein. Jon was, I would say, the epitome of a shoe dog, who had just incredible passion for sneaker culture. Jon was a true friend of mine and partner of Foot Locker Incorporated, and he will be missed by all. Our thoughts and prayers certainly go out to his wife, Carol, and to Gene Yoon and the entire Fila family.","So, with that, Shelby, back to you for some Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt McClintock of Barclays.","Matt McClintock","Hi. Yes. Good morning everyone.","Dick Johnson","Hi, Matt.","Matt McClintock","Dick. Two questions. The first one is just -- there's clearly a lot going on at Foot Locker. And now it's definitely a good time to have an Investor Day to tell us the details on it. But just, it seems like in the last month, you've done more things than you've done in the last 10 years. And I was just wondering if you could give us, like, a little bit of a background into the timing of the acquisitions, how you went about going through the process there, how you went about shutting down 6:02, all of that, because it's just so much to be had in a matter of a couple of weeks, that seems like you just decided, woke up one day and you're just going to clearly change things?","Dick Johnson","Well, I don\u2019t know that we woke up one day and decided to change, Matt. I understand the thought, but if you go back to August of 2017 when we acknowledge that our customer was moving fast and we need to change the way that we did business. We started the evaluation process both in internal and in external view of some of the capabilities that we might be lacking, some of the opportunities that were out there. And as we look across the various opportunities, the fact that we\u2019ve mentioned, we called out and made the investment. And the nearly one was Carbon38. That was about a year ago when we first invested.","We've had a long-term relationship with D'Wayne and the folks at PENSOLE. We decided to formalize that and invest to make sure that we're giving back to the industry that fuels us. As we looked at Jason and the team at Super Heroic, they've got a great concept. It's about getting kids active and playing, which again drives our core community effort, and connects really well with our Kids Foot Locker effort, as does Rockets of Awesome with Rachel and her team.","And the kids business is really something that's important. Last time, we saw those two opportunities to expand the product and the way that we speak with that consumer. And then go -- the secondary market is something that's highly critical to sneaker culture. And Eddy and Daishin have done a great job of creating, what I think is the leading marketplace in the secondary market. And the relationship that we can have to extend benefits to the entire sneaker culture with GOAT is tremendous. So, yes, it's all been announced over a relatively short period of time. It came to bear fruit over a short period of time, but it's work that we've been doing for 10, 12, 18 months in some cases.","Lauren Peters","Yes. I would eco that, because when you make a decision to make an investment, it comes after very thoughtful conversations about whether the goals are aligned and if we mutually see things that will be favorably received by our customer. I understand the perspective, it all seems to come at once, but its not.","Matt McClintock","Well, its good to see that you\u2019re investing because that\u2019s the only way where it stay at top of changing marketplace. Second question just to Dick, you are always pretty consistent saying that, the heat, the product is getting better as we gone to the back half of this year going into next year and you\u2019re getting better allocations et cetera, yet you\u2019re now implying a mid-single-digit comp for the full year. Does that imply that you just don\u2019t see the same level of heat as what are seeing today?","Dick Johnson","Not by any stretch, Matt. Again, the comp numbers are sometimes what you\u2019re up against \u2013 it\u2019s the flow of holidays, the flow of money into the marketplace. So there's a lot of variables when it comes to the guidance in the comp. But we see a tremendous amount of innovation from our partners across the industry. The heat continues to come. So we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m comfortable with a mid-single digit comp. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do that, right. It\u2019s \u2013 every day we have to come in and the team has to lace up their sneakers and go to work hard because it\u2019s difficult out there and there's a lot of competition. But we think we are well positioned with our vendor partners and the collaboration that we\u2019ve got to continue to lead the industry.","Matt McClintock","Thanks for the color guys. Great quarter and I wish you best of luck.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Svezia of Wedbush.","Chris Svezia","Good morning everyone. Congratulations on a really strong finish to the year.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Chris.","Chris Svezia","I guess, first, just on Europe for a moment. You've seen a nice sequential improvement throughout 2018. I'm curious about how you think about that region as you move forward. And I guess, more specifically on the margin, I know it's been promotional there. Just sort of where that stands at this point and any thoughts about Brexit?","I know, from a supply chain perspective, you're based in Rotterdam and just how that might affect movement of product to the U.K. that kind of thing. Just any color on that, Europe would be great?","Dick Johnson","There\u2019s a lot of questions in one, Chris. We feel good about the moment that we\u2019ve seen across our Foot Locker banner in Europe. They\u2019ve done a good job of getting the assortment shifted. Took a little bit longer than of us sort of like, but I think they\u2019re in a really strong position heading into 2019. We are full priced business, right. So, the market place is promotional, probably a little promotional than it has been. But the fact is that we are building deep connections with our customers, right. The power stores that we opened and Liverpool and Marble Arch in London, show us that the consumers got tremendous appetite and as we create exciting product and content they enjoys shopping and they\u2019re willing to pay full price.","So, our focuses on full price selling and we\u2019ll continue to be. When we think about Brexit, there\u2019s lack of clarity still what it's going to mean, but undoubtedly it will change the flow of products a bit, which means we have to think differently about shipping from the continent to the U.K. we will likely end up with a distribution point in the UK that helps us moderate some of the impact of Brexit. But as much as I wanted to be resolved, I think there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done based on all that I\u2019ve read it here. So, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the opportunities with Brexit and what it means to our European business.","Lauren Peters","Or best to be as nimble as possible.","Chris Svezia","Understood. Thank you. And then just on \u2013 my second question is on the apparel business, the comments about margin finally surpassing that on footwear. Congratulations, but I guess sort of the question is, where does it go from here, do you feel like does that can continue to accelerate based on your visibility? And how does that play into your sort of 20 to 40 basis points improvement in gross margin on the year?","Dick Johnson","We don\u2019t really break gross margin down by product category, but we feel comfortable with the work that apparel team is doing, right. But we want our footwear margins to get better too by the way, but the team did a great job with some collaborations and putting exciting product into the market place. And as we get better with apparel and they manage the life cycle of the apparel better we continue to believe that there\u2019s upside in the margin.","So, again, all of the categories sort of come together when you talk about improving product margin, we need to get our accessories business a little bit healthier when we do that we\u2019ll see that will add a couple of bps to the mix as well. So our apparel team has done a tremendous job complementing the great work that our footwear team is doing. So from a margin perspective they\u2019ll keep working way at that.","Chris Svezia","Okay. Thank you and congratulations.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Chris. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sam Poser of Susquehanna.","Sam Poser","Thank you for taking my questions. Some of the questions have been answered and you answered a lot on the call. Just a quick housekeeping and then I\u2019ll have another one. Lauren, what do you think the tax rates are going to be for next year within this year within your guidance?","Lauren Peters","27.5 would be our guidance on that.","Sam Poser","That\u2019s high.","Lauren Peters","Yes.","Sam Poser","Okay.","Dick Johnson","Remember, we\u2019ve got a mix of internationals business in that, Sam that, we don\u2019t get the complete benefit of just being a U.S. base business.","Sam Poser","Got you. And then, thank you. And then also could you give us \u2013 you\u2019ve got apparently a lot of pairs of the YEEZYs in the fourth quarter. Could you us some idea of sort of how you think about that a month from -- months from now. And could you tell us sort of how you -- where you are on loyalty program and changing sort of the way you flow product versus where you really what to be?","Dick Johnson","Look, in terms of YEEZY, you\u2019re right, we certainly benefited from some YEEZY business in the fourth quarter as there were some really great launches across that particular model. We expect Kanye and Adidas will continue to bring heat across the YEEZY platform. So, you weather the launches all line up perfectly. I mean, that\u2019s one of the challenges of the business as you know, Sam, that we look at comp days, but we\u2019re were happy when we can find the right launch change [ph] with our vender partners. So, again I\u2019m confident that our merchant team is working with Adidas to make sure that we\u2019ve got the Yeezy flow correct for our business.","In terms of loyalty, we are continuing to drive on our membership program. We\u2019ll share more details with that later in March as we go through our Investor Day, but it will be an exciting program for the industry I believe. And the product flow, I feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at from a product flow perspective, Sam. I\u2019m not exactly sure what the question around that was, but as it relates to the various geographies the rhythms feels pretty good one now.","Sam Poser","Thank you. I was really discussing sort of the flow, the flow of product versus sort of how quickly the kid is changing his mind on your sneaker. The fans are changing their minds, but you need to flow less -- I mean, arguably, less pairs of more product more frequently.","Dick Johnson","Yes. No, you're absolutely right. And again, our core consumers moving faster than ever. And we've talked about that on a number of calls and we don't expect that to slow down. So the great work that our product and marketing teams are doing to connect with the vendors to flow the product appropriately, things like the initiatives we've talked about in the prepared remarks, with Adidas and the Speedfactory, which allow us to do some very localized product for various events. Those are all things that connect with this fast-moving consumer, but I don't expect the consumers' preferences to slow down, their changes and preferences to slow down.","Sam Poser","Thanks. And then one last thing. For the first \u2013 you talked about the headwinds in the first quarter, but from a comp basis, I mean, given the comparison and all and coming out of the quarter, I mean, would you expect comps in the mid-single digit range to be better, let\u2019s say, in the first half of the year -- first quarter versus the second half of the year just given the comparison?","Lauren Peters","Yes. I mean, I reiterate the guidance we gave. Mid-single digit comps and we\u2019re seeing that across the quarters watching Q1, as the tax money flows. ","Sam Poser","Okay. Thanks very much.","Dick Johnson","Thank you, Sam.","Operator","Your next question comes from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo Lyon","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll add my congrats on a quarter.","Dick Johnson","Thank you.","Camilo Lyon","I was looking to give a little bit more color on your basketball business. I think you said it was down mid-single in a quarter. Maybe think you just parse out what you\u2019re seeing from Jordan as well as some signature and how that flow should evolve in 2019? And what composition of -- what expectations do you have for that business for 2019 and how that flows into comp?","Dick Johnson","Yes. I\u2019ll provide little bit of color, Camilo, but my feeling continues to be the same, that our kid has motivated by the coolest product. There are far less category dependent or respondent than they are just around cool. So one of the hard issues in the marketplace today is the AJ1, right, which is classic basketball shoe. It may get classified in some cases as a classic and then some people may call it a basketball shoe, but right now it's got a lot of heat behind it, as does the Air Force 1.","We\u2019re seen some sparks of heat around some of the signature product from LeBron specifically and little bit from Tyreke. So again, I think that there is great momentum around the coming basketball and I think the reenergizing of the House of Hoops that we've seen through our mobile effort in Charlotte.","Certainly, when we did the Hampton, the effort out in Los Angeles around LeBron's first game as a Laker, there's still a lot of energy around basketball and we're confident that the product flow will be there to support it. Again, I'm less riveted about one basketball comps positive because our kid cares about the coolest products. And we're going to continue to drive heat through cool products.","Camilo Lyon","Thanks for that. Can you say if Jordan was positive for you in the quarter?","Dick Johnson","The Jordan sell-through numbers were improved over a year ago. So the Jordan team and Nike does a great job controlling the flow into the marketplace and we believe that we get \u2013 I don\u2019t know fair share is the right word, because fair is a not a word that works in business that often. But I saw \u2013 we saw great sell-throughs on the Jordan product that we brought into the marketplace, and a healthy sell-through with Jordan is what really motivates the heat and motivates the kid in our category to come to the stores and shop online with us.","Camilo Lyon","Got it. And then, just my next question, I \u2013 if you could take it up Lauren, this comp performance 97 [ph] was the best comp put out since 2015. And during that period your EBIT margins were substantially higher than where they landed out this year. Is there anything structurally preventing you from getting back to that low double-digit, low teens margin rate over time as we have discontinued kind of product laid, in-store laid sort of momentum that\u2019s driving this continued comp strength?","Lauren Peters","I appreciate the question and we\u2019re going to get to March 28 and we\u2019re going to talk about all of those stuff that we got going on for the long term and what that means to us financially. I could ask you to hold that. We\u2019ll have lots of opportunity to talk about all the good things that we\u2019re working on in the financial results.","Dick Johnson","I think Lauren\u2019s guidance around 2019 was pretty clear to where we -- where your model will get us to, but we\u2019ll talk more long-term when we get to the 20th.","Camilo Lyon","Okay. Maybe if I can just ask it a different way from the perspective of the spent and the initiatives that you talked about for this year. This showing a lot that you're going after as you rightly should be. If you were to classify where you\u2019re at on this investment cycle? Can you give us some sort of context?","Dick Johnson","Well, I don\u2019t know about investments as we\u2019ve talked about before coming. I don't know that the investments really\u2026","Lauren Peters","Your question is around CapEx?","Camilo Lyon","Yes. Absolutely CapEx and then how that obviously affects \u2013 going to affect the P&L from a SG&A perspective, so clearly you're always going to be investing and there is no shortage of things to invest in. But there will be years in which you invest more than others and where project start to create that leverage and give the returns that you hope that they would do. So, any sort of articulation as to where that investment cycle is, would be great?","Lauren Peters","Yes. So, clearly we are still investing in our fleet. We know a physical experience is important to our customer. And again we\u2019re going to tell you lots about the things that we\u2019re doing and we described. That excitement and experience look like in the fourth quarter pretty completely. And it gets just through the Q1 sorts of thing. So those come to life in a physical way and therefore we continue to invest on the fleet. We also describe more new doors than we had in 2018. So, as you open a new door you get better leverage on that investment over the longer term.","But we also described a fair chunk in the CapEx that relates to a digital and other infrastructure logistic, so, this two bear fruit over the longer term. You\u2019re going to get a better picture for what all of that looks like when we talk at the end of the month. The digital initiative -- some bit of that as we\u2019ve described before foundational in its nature, so that when you look to a longer term you get passed. But we\u2019re working on some exciting forward stuff that\u2019s also reflected in that spent.","Camilo Lyon","Sounds great. Looking forward to the Analyst Day for more color. Thanks and good luck guys.","Lauren Peters","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Sole of UBS.","Jay Sole","Great. Thank you. Dick, it sounds like your digital business grew almost 30% of growth, sounds of like an accelerating point, can you talk about some of the key drivers were in that part of the company?","Dick Johnson","We\u2019ve been talking about quarter after quarter, Jay, right. We\u2019ve invested in the new platform. We\u2019ve reorganize so the team is thinking about it from an omni point of view. We\u2019re utilizing our stores as opportunities to leverage the inventory that sits in stores even though you\u2019re shopping online. So it\u2019s a ton of work that\u2019s going on for a long time that really is starting to bear fruit. And I think -- I don\u2019t know how to prioritize those things, but they\u2019re all important and we continue to believe that there will be improvements in that along the way.","As our team thinks more from an omni point of view as we leverage more efficient supply chain, as we figure out more ways to connect with this consumer, but we are true believers that it\u2019s a physical and the digital presence that really extends us, help separate us in the marketplace. Our consumer\u2019s likes to be in our stores, learn, talk about traffic being down a little bit, but we firmly believe that our traffic is better than the traffic in the malls, and that we are destination for these kids. So it\u2019s a real marriage of the digital and physical that\u2019s making the difference.","Lauren Peters","Now, that\u2019s just so synergistic. We give the comps split out between the two, but when you really focus on from a customer journey, the channels are synergistic.","Jay Sole","Got it. And may Lauren, if I can follow-up with one more, just on the inventory, you give inventory position for the NBA All-Star game in February when tax refunds are supposed to come. Is that \u2013 which are the tax refunds that are starting to get better now. Would they show up in the next few weeks? Is that inventory still is relevant to the consumer if they had money sort of like in the first part of March versus the last part of February or do you getting into situation where just because that inventories maybe couple weeks older than you thought it was going be where people are coming in there is sort of mark down pressure?","Lauren Peters","Thankfully the lifecycle is not that short. So, our team does an excellent job of figuring out flow of that product and what they think our customers going to response to and thankfully you don\u2019t measure the lifecycle of product. That short, I do measure in weeks, but not that short.","Jay Sole","Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good morning and let me add my congratulations.","Dick Johnson","Thanks, Erinn.","Erinn Murphy","I guess couple of questions. First from a double-digit ASP growth, could you help us think about how much was driven by product mix versus to like-for-like pricing? And then I guess, Lauren, you alluded this markdown control is almost a record high, but just curious on those three major components that drove the double digit APS growth?","Dick Johnson","Well, again, we haven\u2019t really segmented out the three pieces Erinn, specifically, but we had a great mix of product. When you think about the price point of the Yeezy that were mentioned earlier on the call. When you think about Timberland, Champion Collab that we had when you think about premium fleece that we sold in the store, when you think about the benefit of some elevated kids pricing, all of those things contributed ASPs. Lauren talked in her remarks about our markdowns being almost record lows for us, personal best that she put it. That\u2019s good inventory management which allows us to some more for price cuts [ph]. It\u2019s a combination of all of them, right, I mean, it\u2019s a pretty complex model when you get to our ASP model.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. Fair enough. And then just kind of carrying that through to 2019 guidance from a mid-single digit comp, what\u2019s your assumption for traffic versus kind of ticket or pricing as you think about mid-single?","Lauren Peters","Yes. Of course we think through all of that, but again, we\u2019ve described it is combination of physical and digital, so when you think about traffic, you really think about it across the channels. The customer is responding to this compelling product where they find value in it, where we\u2019re bringing them something different. It supports these ASPs which add on to Dick\u2019s commentary that our merchants are very, very thoughtful about the offering across the price point, but we really want to make sure that we have compelling product across the spectrum. And when they respond to it at a full price you get this final list on ASPS.","Erinn Murphy","Got it. And then just last question for me, on that relationship with Gold, I\u2019m curious if you guys have assets to use their data, there\u2019s quite about 11 million users. And then in your due diligence process what was the overlap? Could you see any overlap between your loyal members versus their users? Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Yes. We\u2019re not going get into the specifics of the relationship Erinn. They have a ton of sneaker lovers. We have a ton of sneaker lovers. And it is about delivering a great experience to the broader sneaker market. And we will be able to learn from them. They will be able to learn from us and get beyond that. I believe the consumer, the sneaker consumer will benefit.","Erinn Murphy","Fair enough. Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Erinn.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kernan of Cowen.","John Kernan","Good morning guys and congrats on a fantastic finish to the year.","Dick Johnson","Thank you.","John Kernan","Can you talk about Europe and what you're seeing over there? Obviously, trends have improved significantly at adi. Adi went through a period of contraction in terms of their overall growth rate within that region. So, I'm just wondering what you're seeing overall in Europe, and then also Asia sounded like it was pretty strong as well. So if you can give us some more detail on international that would be great?","Dick Johnson","Well, I'll start with Asia because it's relatively small, right. We just stood up five stores across three countries and the Power Store in Hong Kong is off to a fantastic start in our presence as certainly being felt in the marketplace being a premium destination of multi-brand opportunities and the consumer across Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong are all responding well.","So again we're excited about that and we'll be accelerating the growth, but we're going to be pragmatic about it. We've got a lot to learn about the region and the geography. But the shift in our organization to put Lou directly over just the Asia Pacific business will allow us to focus our resources in that marketplace. When you talk about Europe it's still is a market that's driven by the running silhouette, so the chunky midsole, the Fila Disruptor etcetera, those shoes have been very positive over there and we've seen a tremendous resurgence of Nike Air Products over there.","The 20th anniversary of Tuned Air which really has been a strong product across those 20 years in the European market brought a lot of heat in the fourth quarter and throughout the year and we expect the positive nature of the Max Air product to continue. The team over there is working on collaborations as well that are unique to the marketplace and bring a lot of heat. So, we're seeing a lot of the right signals in Western Europe certainly and we believe that we can be strong there.","John Kernan","Got it. And then I think on this call you've talked a lot about some of the smaller up and coming brands whether it's Barnes, fetlock, you mentioned Timberland, Champion. Can you talk about how much interest in traffic and how much these brands are contributing more than they were in the past? And as you know obviously Nike remains an enormous portion in the business, but I'm just wondering it feels like you're talking more about some of the newer brands that you're introducing to consumers and going through collaborations within partnerships with and so. Just talk about some of the other brands other than Nike and Adi and the performance there?","Dick Johnson","Well, don't break out the performance. You know when we file our K you\u2019ll see the big performers listed, but the truth in any quarter is our team has done a tremendous job of finding energy with some of these secondary brands to complement the great heat that Nike and Adidas and Jordan bring to the marketplace. So when you think about a Timberland, Champion Collab, right, I mean, something that's unexpected our consumer responds quickly and passionately about those sort of opportunities.","We think about some of the things that brand [ph] has done. They create a tremendous amount of heat in the marketplace and the consumer wants to be part of that. So, the thing that's really changed or accelerated I think is continues to be the digital presence that all of those brands have and the work that everybody does to fuel the sneaker culture in our consumers, right at the heart of that.","Lauren Peters","They are hyper informed and they want to be part of it. And I think their receptivity to brands discovering brands being part of that is for the highest I've seen in my career.","Dick Johnson","All that being said, we know that our big brands continue to drive tremendous heat across the marketplace and our consumer response to that as well.","John Kernan","Got it. Well congratulations on a great year and best of luck with forward to the Investor Day in a few weeks.","Dick Johnson","Thanks John. We've got time for one more question I think.","Operator","Your final question comes from Michael Bonetti of Credit Suisse.","Michael Bonetti","Hey guys. Let me add my congrats on nice quarter. Thanks for getting our question in here. Just a quick model modeling question. Just the rough framework you gave, Lauren, mid-single digit comps, I think that EBIT margins down a little bit, get back a little bit on the operating line. So with the tax rate you gave to Sam earlier it looks like a lot of the EPS growth comes from share repurchases this year. Is that \u2013 am I thinking about the components there correctly?","Lauren Peters","Reiterate mid-single digit top line comps 20 to 40 bps of expansion in gross margin, 40 to 60 declines in the reins [ph] on SG&A and so more pressure. And tax rate 27.5 and expectation we execute opportunistically on share repurchase double digit EPS growth.","Michael Bonetti","Okay. Let me ask you I think on the margin, Lauren, you mentioned the gross margin to be up this year. You just give us the numbers again and it will be largely from buying an occupancy, but you did see markdowns on you peak merchandise margin as we track quarter clearly isn't. I'm trying to follow you there. I don't see a significant distortion in the mix of categories or geographies and you even said apparel margins had some momentum. Is there some change in the merchandise margin within the footwear category that would limit margins from going back to the historical levels?","Lauren Peters","Again, our markdowns which is the biggest lover. We're at personal best or getting close to them. Quietly it's different by geography and some mix question to some degree. But as we think about it you know the focus is that at your personal best on markdowns then the other lovers would what would create longer term opportunities. So we're looking at what we've got. Logistically that would help us flow the product effectively etcetera. But again these are things longer term that we can give you more color on at the end of the month.","Michael Bonetti","Okay. let me just one last one in there on the SG&A growth implied in the margin leverage you gave there. There\u2019s a lot of investment. I certainly understand why you'd want to claw back some of the top line momentum here to keep that going. Can you just help us think about the leverage point on the SG&A this year how much of that could be more leverageable if you can drive comps above that mid-single digit range?","Lauren Peters","Well, I think if you look back to 2018 you can see that we're very thoughtful about the expenses and levering anything incremental to the bottom. So within SG&A they\u2019re biggest expenses are selling wages certainly well first and what's happening with that and marketing. But it's one of the beauties of all this data is that you can get ever smarter about how they use those marketing dollars more effectively. Those are the bigger lever points.","Michael Bonetti","Okay. Thanks a lot. And congrats again look forward to seeing you guys a few weeks. ","Lauren Peters","Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at time.","Dick Johnson","Okay. Thank you for joining us today everyone. Please join us again for next earnings call which we insist will take at 9 am on Friday May, 24th. The call will follow the release of our first quarter results earlier that morning. Thanks again and good bye.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"9478":["Foot Locker, Inc.

Maurer","Thank you, Beatrice. Good morning to everyone and welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s second quarter earnings conference call. I'm pleased to report that the Company achieved net income of $127 million in the quarter on the strength of a 4.7% comparable sales gain and an improved gross margin rate. Earnings per share came in at $0.94, up 12% from a year ago and 47% up above our EPS two years ago, as we continue to drive consistent improvements in operating and financial performance over the long term. In fact, this quarter was the 26th consecutive quarter with meaningful sales and profit gains over the prior year period. This strong second quarter result brought our year-to-date earnings to $318 million or $2.33 per share, a 9% increase over a year ago and the best start to a year in Foot Locker's history.","Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will start us off by discussing the Company's second quarter financial performance, followed by Dick Johnson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, who will discuss the various strengths Foot Locker has in the athletic industry and highlight some key product trends. After that, we'll be happy to get to your questions. Lauren?","Lauren B. Peters","Thank you, John. Good morning to all of you and thank you for your interest in Foot Locker. On overall, the second quarter finished near where we planned the business. As usual, there were some performances that stood above the rest and other areas where traction was somewhat elusive.","Starting on the positive side of the ledger, Foot Locker Canada again led our Store division, followed closely by Champs Sports, both with low double-digit comparable sales gains. Foot Locker Canada pulled off a hat-trick with double-digit gains in footwear, apparel, and accessories. Champs Sports posted gains at all three areas too, representing an important inflection point for Champs where apparel and accessories constitute the largest sales penetration of any of our banners.","Several Store divisions produced comp gains in the mid-single-digit range, including Foot Locker in the U.S. As we noted on the last call, our flagship Foot Locker store on 34th Street was closed for the entire quarter, negatively impacting the total Company comp by a few ticks, ticks meaning tens of basis points. The Foot Locker U.S. division itself was impacted by more than 100 basis points. So we are pleased with how well the Foot Locker team in the U.S. navigated that headwind.","Foot Locker Europe, Foot Locker Asia-Pacific, and Footaction were the other divisions with mid-single-digit comps. With the performance of some exciting new stores such as State Street in Chicago, Footaction in total generated a double-digit sales increase.","The strategy to expand our leading position in the kids business continues to be a major contributor to our success. The Kids Foot Locker itself produced a low-single-digit comp increase. With the net addition of 26 stores, total sales were up almost 10%. Sales of children's footwear in our other banners were up double digits.","Lady Foot Locker\/SIX:02 comped down low-mid single, unfortunately breaking its two year streak of comp gains. Although footwear sales continued to be strong, apparel was down double-digits. Lifestyle apparel sold well, but we didn't keep pace with the rapid shift out of performance styles by our female customers.","Runners Point and Sidestep banners continued to run off double digits, pressured by traffic declines that seemed to be at least in part a function of local events in Germany. The traffic was also down in our Foot Locker stores in Germany, and Foot Locker sales were softer there than in most other markets.","Turning to our Direct-to-Customers segment, the business overall comped up 7.1%. Sales by our store banner dotcom businesses in the U.S. increased in the teens, with significantly higher growth rates at Foot Locker's digital businesses in Europe and Canada.","On the negative side of the ledger, Eastbay continues to struggle with sales declining high-single digits. A shift away from performance continued to challenge this very sports-focused banner, as did the heightened sporting-goods liquidation activity that went on during the quarter.","For the total Company, footwear continued to be the standout category, with an overall gain in the upper end of mid-single digits. Running was up mid-single digits and so was basketball, while court classic and casual styles led the way with high-single-digit gain.","The fairly consistent sales results across footwear categories this quarter is yet another excellent example of our ability to navigate the never-ending shifts in style preferences of our customers who continue to look to our stores and online sites for the most innovative, trend-right sneakers. They know they can count on us to have what's hot, or should I say what's cool.","Maintaining the trend of recent quarters, both average selling prices and units were up in footwear during the quarter, while in apparel, ASPs were up and units were down reflecting our ongoing shift to more premium apparel assortments. Our apparel business continues to improve with men's apparel, by far the largest piece of the category for us, up mid-single digits and kids' apparel up double digits. The women's side, as I mentioned before, was challenged, as were accessories. The socks business was the main culprit in accessories, still running down double digits, although we generated gains in hats, bag, and shoe care products.","You will recall that when we gave you our quarter-to-date comp results back in May, we were running negative, but we said we expected the month of May to end positive, which is in fact what happened. We then had a very strong June, up high single digits, with July up mid-single digits. The overall result was the mid-single-digit comparable sales gain to which we guided early in the quarter.","After looking at the relationship over time of our quarter-to-date comps with our finished comps for the quarter and by listening to many of you, we have concluded that our quarter to date results as of the time of our calls are not useful indicators of the expected pace of business for the total quarter. And so after this call, we will no longer provide the quarter-to-date comps. Rest assured, the quarter-to-date comp, whatever it is, will be factored into the comp guidance we do provide you for the upcoming quarter.","If there are some special short-term effects that warrant calling out, we will do so. But between launch shift holiday, payday shifts and the like, we believe providing early quarter to date comp does not add value to understanding our business. That said, for this final mention of quarter to date comps, they are up mid-single digits, in line with our expectation for comparable sales to be up mid-single digits for the full quarter.","Turning now to the rest of the income statement, John mentioned the strong gross margin rate, which was 33% for the quarter, up 40 basis points from a year ago. The gains were driven by lower markdowns in our stores, partially offset by a decline in the merchandise margin of our Direct-to-Customers business. In response to the competitive environment and a softening of traffic to our U.S. Web-sites, we were more promotional on our digital businesses than we had expected heading into the quarter.","We also spent more to drive traffic to our Web-sites, which contributed to a slight deleverage of our SG&A in the quarter to 19.7%. Overall, we had very good expense management, especially in store wages. However, as we noted on the call in May, with two of our biggest stores closed for the entire duration of what is already our lowest sales volume quarter, our leverage point was challenged.","Depreciation expense continued to trend up as a result of our ongoing investments in customer experience, both in-store and digital, while our tax rate continued to run slightly below our plan due to the proportionately higher mix of income from our international operations relative to the U.S.","We continued to manage inventory very closely, posting a 1.7% increase compared to a 5% total sales increase. This inventory discipline is key to our ability to continue with free flow in the fresh exciting products our customers expect and extend our full-price selling even further. Meanwhile, our inventory turn rate is inching ever closer to the 3x target we set as our goal several years ago.","The income statement and balance sheet performances we have executed in recent years have positioned us to deliver on the balanced approach to capital allocation to which we are committed. Specifically, we invested $66 million of capital in the business during the quarter to be executed on our elevated capital expenditure program this year. That said, it is probable that we will come in $5 million to $10 million below the $297 million target we set at the beginning of the year, with the shortfall primarily the result of the timing of certain substantial projects related both to stores and infrastructure initiatives, and a shortfall in spending this year will likely roll over to next year. We also spent $188 million in the quarter to buy back 3.35 million shares, bringing our total year to date shareholder return including dividends to $350 million compared to $275 million in the first half of 2015.","With the mid-single-digit comparable sales gain that I mentioned, we're planning for the third quarter we will likely see similar operating metrics that we've seen so far this year, with gross margin up slightly and a bit of deleverage in SG&A driven by the digital business, leading to an EPS increase that should be double-digit or close to it. Our outlook for the full year remains in mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and double-digit EPS growth.","Let me now hand the call to Dick to discuss our leadership position in the industry and highlight a few of the key product trends for the quarter.","Richard A. Johnson","Thanks Lauren. Greetings everyone. Foot Locker is the leading company. Our vision for many years has been to be the leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel. The goal of any competition however, and retail is a terrific competition each and every day, is not to be leading at the midway point of the race, it's to be the leader at the end, except in retail there is never an end to the race. So we strive through our strategic initiatives to build our Company to be an enduring retail leader with strengths across a variety of dimensions.","First and foremost we must be leaders with our customers. We are leaders in understanding what our customers want and how and when they want it. We spend a tremendous amount of time identifying the key characteristics of the core customers of each of our banners and what makes them want to engage and transact with us. This work in turn makes us a leading partner for our world-class vendors as they create and market their most innovative, athletically inspired products.","The investments we have made in our store fleet, both in the physical appearance of the stores and the quality of the merchandise assortments, have led to our stores being destinations for our customers. This can be seen in our traffic results which consistently outpaced overall mall or high street traffic. Our traffic was up in the U.S. this quarter, although it was down somewhat in Europe. Being a strong retail destination positions us as the leading partner with our landlords in the malls and increasingly in the prime shopping streets across our global footprint.","And our most important investments have been in our people, leading us to have in my opinion the best talents in retail, including our associates in our stores, in the field and in all of our support facilities. This powerful combination enabled us to build strong leadership positions across the athletic retail industry. Let me first talk about product categories.","We believe we are the leading retailer of premium sneakers; period. Not just a specific category of sneakers; sneakers, full stop. Yes, we are the leader in basketball. Lauren mentioned that basketball footwear was up mid single digits. The gains came in a variety of silhouettes, primarily from Jordan Retros, Nike Foamposites, Superstars from adidas and certain signature basketball shoes such as Kyrie Irving from Nike and Stephen Curry from Under Armour to call out a few.","We were up in running footwear, where we also lead the market. The category here was led by lifestyle products such as the established Roshe and Huarache programs from Nike, with growth driven especially by Nomads and Ultra Boost from adidas and the Presto from Nike.","Finally, we lead the market in sales of various casual and premium classic shoes. This quarter, some of the standout styles were Stan Smiths from adidas and PUMA Suedes and Fierce. We have strong inventory positions as well as important exclusives and collaborations in many of these classic styles, just as we do in running and basketball.","Our vendors know that our banners provide the perfect battleground spread out to win market share, especially with the young male customers who buy the most sneakers and who are the style influencers for the rest of their generation, and increasingly for the rest of us since every day it seems more and more adults are wearing sneakers too. And that's why the leading brands continue to be highly motivated to collaborate with us on these exclusives and strong allocations.","We're a leading retailer of premium athletic footwear and apparel, not just in the U.S. but also across Western Europe, Canada and Australia. Lauren mentioned that the Foot Locker banner was up mid single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific, but what she didn't mention is that both of those gains came on top of strong double-digit gains a year ago, leading to two-year stacked gains close to 20%. Running is the leading product category in both of those divisions by the way, not basketball. And Canada's double digit comp gain this year also came on top of a double-digit gain last year. Those are definitely all industry-leading performances.","We are not just leaders in store productivity, but our digital businesses are approaching annual sales of $1 billion as we continue to connect with our customers often multiple times on their journey to selecting their favorite sneaker or piece of apparel. Those connections are more and more often happening on mobile devices where we lead in social media interaction, including some of the newer platforms such as Instagram Stories, Facebook Live and Snapchat. Right now, you can check out the recent exclusive Twitter Q&A we hosted with James Harden, and next week we are partnering in the launch of the Bitmoji app. We'll have hustle groups in SIX:02 stores within Bitmoji fashion where customers can outfit their avatars in the latest products from Nike, adidas and others.","Finally, I want to mention that we've been hard at work creating what I believe will be the leading destination for the best in athletic footwear and apparel and accessories right here in Midtown Manhattan. Our flagship store on 34th Street is scheduled to reopen in a matter of days and we couldn't be more excited about it. The space will include not just pinnacle footwear experiences but also a new and exciting presence for SIX:02 here in the city, as well as partnership spaces with multiple vendors. The details are still a bit under wraps but rest assured there will be plenty of fanfare about it soon. So please look for that over the next couple of weeks, and if you are in the area, you should visit the store once it opens.","All of these efforts I've just described has led to the strong financial performance we have produced over the last 6.5 years, which has in turn enabled us to provide industry-leading shareholder returns, including the elevated share repurchases Lauren described earlier. Yet we feel our work has just begun. As I said before, the competition in retail is never over and we still have a long way to go to reach most of the 2020 objectives we laid out at the beginning of last year.","Within our solid growth plan, we have initiatives that are delivering excellent results now, such as expanding the kids' business globally, building out the Foot Locker banner in Europe and growing our digital business, plus our core business of selling athletic footwear to young males in the U.S. is making steady progress towards the productivity objectives embedded in our long-term goals based in large measure on the remodel program we continue to execute.","Meanwhile, we are making real headway in the apparel business, as seen especially by the strong results in Europe and the turnaround in Champs Sports. It will still take some time for our improvements in apparel to substantially move the needle, so I see this as a very important intermediate term opportunity for the Company, along with the turnaround in the Runners Point and Sidestep banners we are working on diligently.","Finally, the women's business remains a tremendous long-term opportunity. As I've said, we are excited to bring SIX:02 to New York City in a few days, with another key shop opening in our Times Square location towards the end of the year. And if you're not in New York or near any of our other SIX:02 stores, you can see the exciting progress we are making at six02.com.","We will keep partnering with our vendors to create and deliver the exciting lifestyle products connected with the meaningful assets to which our female customers have responded enthusiastically. Although we've known all along it will take quite some time to build the business profitably to scale, we do have some exciting product and marketing initiatives coming in the near term. These include a continued and enhanced relationship with PUMA featuring MIANA FANCY products that we believe will help give the SIX:02 brand an immediate momentum boost.","Before we get to your questions, I must thank the excellent team of associates we have at Foot Locker for producing yet another record quarter. The second quarter used to be our toughest quarter. In fact, it still is. But now, instead of barely breaking even in the second quarter, as we did early on in our journey, this year we earned $127 million or $0.94 per share. It took a lot of excellent teamwork over several years to get us to this level of performance. So as we look to the future in how we can improve the business even further, I have to acknowledge all the tremendously good work done by everyone that went into producing the high quality industry-leading results that we announced today. Thank you all very much.","Beatrice, let's open the phone call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question, Jonathan Komp from Barclays is on the line with a question.","Matthew McClintock","This is Matt McClintock. I was confused there for a second. Great quarter, congrats, really impressed by the results there. I just had a question, there were two questions actually. First, Dick, you talked about traffic and positive traffic for the quarter and how you were a destination. There is a lot of discussion in retail today about the closing of anchor tenants in malls. I was wondering if you could dive a little bit more into how you view your positioning, particularly in malls where anchor tenants may be closed, and maybe provide some color about success you've had in malls that maybe aren't even A or B malls?","Richard A. Johnson","Sure. Our U.S. traffic was up in the quarter, Matt, and the closing of anchor stores has been going on for a while. We believe there's only a couple of places in the mall that people will line up for products. One of them is a Foot Locker family store and one of them is the Apple Store. So we know that our customers, our core consumers want to be in our stores. So the anchors, certainly there are some lease ramifications when anchors close, but our focus is more on the connectivity with our consumer, the engagement we have with our consumer, building exciting places to shop and buy. They interact with us digitally on their way to the mall, they in the mall will take a photo of the sneaker on their foot, and they'll tweet it out or they will send it out to their group of friends and we get the responses back.","So the anchors closing is a change certainly in the makeup of the malls, but our consumer is still driven to the malls as a place for social interaction with their friends. So we are confident that regardless of anchor positioning, we should continue to drive traffic into the malls.","And we have success on both ends of the spectrum, I think was the second part of your question, Matt, whether it's an A mall where we have premium placement and great shopping environment, or a B mall where the mall environment isn't quite the same as those A malls but our core consumer shops there and our associates are definitely engaged with the consumers across the entire spectrum, so the malls are far from dead regardless of what's going on with the anchors.","Lauren B. Peters","And I would add to that, this conversation around malls is centric to the U.S., and Foot Locker, our business outside the U.S., especially in Western Europe, it's much more that parity between street locations and mall locations as the development of malls there has trailed what it's been in the U.S. So we have deep experience in locating stores off mall with good traffic and building them to the unique characteristics of off mall. And if you are in New York City, you've experienced that here in the U.S., but increasingly you will see us taking some of those locations off mall in the U.S. Where the customer is, we are going to be.","Matthew McClintock","Okay. And then one more follow-up, if I may, just on innovation in both basketball and running, you guys have a little bit better visibility into what's coming down the pipeline, can you maybe just fill us in on some of the excitement that you are potentially seeing as we close out the year and around into next year in terms of the innovation platforms and newness in products that may, could continue to drive or should continue to drive meaningful comps in both those categories?","Richard A. Johnson","I think you've seen some of that product, Matt, in the Olympics. You've seen more knit versions of product. The KD 9 launch that came that was the knit upper, closer to the ground product, that's going to roll out more effectively in the back half of the year. There is no significantly new platforms that are coming. I mean there are some tweaks to things that we've seen but the vendors continue to bring innovation and add excitement whether that'd be with knit uppers, whether it'd be with new silhouettes, so the pipeline looks good certainly for the back half of the year across running, basketball, and certainly casual styles as well.","Matthew McClintock","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Eric Tracy from Brean Capital is on the line with a question.","Eric Tracy","Good morning guys and I'll add my congrats on another great quarter. Dick, and maybe even Lauren, for you, I guess just speak to sort of what inning where we are in terms of the reformatting of doors, just some enhancements obviously should be supportive of both the comp and productivity bump, but maybe just kind of talk through where you feel like we are and still the opportunities to come?","Richard A. Johnson","We continue, Eric, with the enhanced or the expanded capital program this year, which is certainly fueling our remodel program. Each of the banners is at a different position. Foot Locker had the earliest start. Footaction is trailing a bit because we just really started that. We'll be roughly a third of the stores by the end of the year.","Lauren B. Peters","Roughly, Foot Locker roughly about a third; Champs a little bit more than that, I think about 40%; Footaction, as you pointed out, a little bit behind that but it would be about 30%; and Europe about the same, about 30% I think end of the year. But as we described earlier in the year, elevated \u2013 this year we had a couple of things going on, New York headquarters and some infrastructure things, we were making investments in our digital experience that will help support the go forward growth, and we would look then as we continue to execute the remodel program in those digital initiatives for the next couple of out years to be at a bit more elevated level. But we will of course describe that for you in much further detail as plans firm up for next year.","Richard A. Johnson","And Eric, I would just add that the inning analogy infers that there is an end and in the game of retail, as I said in my prepared comments, there really is no end. So we have this remodel program that's going. As we finish this one up, we'll be looking at what's motivating the consumer and what it takes to create exciting new shopping environment. So whether it's online, digitally or in-store, we're going to keep investing in the business to make sure that we keep pace with what's motivating the consumer to shop with us.","Eric Tracy","Fair enough. And then I guess my follow-up, in terms of digital, solid comp but you did touch on some promotional, elevated promotional cadence there. Maybe just speak to what exactly you are going, and then in terms of the investments being made behind the digital platform, when we can sort of expect a better chance for leverage within that business?","Richard A. Johnson","The troubled area on our digital business is really the Eastbay brand, and we saw some pressure on the traffic and the pricing in the quarter, especially across the technical categories. So the team [indiscernible] is focused on bringing some traffic back to the banner, which has led to some elevated promotions based on what was going on in the marketplace in Q2, and they are shifting their assortment. They are still very focused on this sports-led high school athlete, but they have also expanded their casual offerings and we expect that to pay benefits.","The investment in our digital space is also an ongoing investment. We are running as fast as we can there to make some upgrades and we'll start to see \u2013 it's a long-range project because there's a lot of plumbing that has to be changed out. So we'll start to see improvements, probably a little bit of leverage later in 2017 would be my guess at this point, sort of the for4ecast.","Eric Tracy","Perfect. Thanks guys. Best of luck.","Operator","Kate McShane from Citi is on the line with a question.","Kate McShane","One of your competitors was out last week saying that they do think that there is quite a bit of excess pairs of footwear floating around post the TSA liquidation. Just wondered if you could walk through how that could potentially impact the business in Q3 and back to school specifically?","Richard A. Johnson","Against the bulk of our brick and mortar banners, I don't necessarily see a big impact because the level of distribution and product segmentation at both TSA and Sports Chalet is different than what we sell at the premium end. I think there is a bit of pressure against the Eastbay business as the completed numbers that you hear, and I have no idea of the numbers that we hear are true or not, but there is some pressure against the pleated side and the performance side of the business. But as it relates to back-to-school and what kids are buying. I don't see a lot of impact to our brick and mortar business, or brick and mortar brands I should say.","Kate McShane","Okay, that's helpful. And for my follow-up question, just because you have the exposure in Western Europe and the U.K. in particular, is there any detail you can give around what you saw during the quarter given Brexit and what your thoughts are for the rest of the year on the U.K. business in particular?","Lauren B. Peters","I think we saw a little bit of impact on traffic on the day of the vote but not much since then. We do have a bit of a currency impact in that we buy for that market in euros and sell in pounds, and so we do what we can to hedge that currency difference.","Richard A. Johnson","I don't think we'll really see much, Kate, until the world starts to understand what it really means, and that's sort of an ongoing debate at this point. So the consumer is back in shopping in the U.K. So we'll keep you posted if we see things differently.","Kate McShane","Okay. If I could just sneak one more in, I know you had some good callouts in the basketball business during the quarter with some of the Nike product and the KD 9. Can you update us at all about the other signature basketball products, since there does seem to be other improvements that have been made since the last time we spoke with you?","Richard A. Johnson","I spoke about the Kyrie shoe from Nike and the Curry shoe from Under Armour, both performed well in the quarter. The KD 9 that launched, again a different price value, a little bit innovation in the upper, a great midsole and outsole combination, so the consumer responded to that. The LeBron Soldier product that he wore in the Playoffs sold well. There is more work going on in basketball and we'll wait until the vendors really bring that to market to talk about it. I certainly would not think of pre-empting some of the good work that they are doing in talking about it before they talk about it. But Kate, basketball, as Lauren mentioned, was up nicely in the quarter. Some of it is signature driven, some of it is lifestyle driven, but still good performance for us. So we see good things in basketball in the back half of the year.","Operator","Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan is on the line with a question.","Matthew Boss","Nice quarter guys. Can you talk about the increased category and brand diversification that you are seeing in the results? I guess do you see this as a competitive advantage giving you the more one-stop shop, and just any change in pricing or overall ASPs that we should consider as some of this mix changes?","Richard A. Johnson","We have said it many times, Matt, that our consumers are not driven by categories, they are driven by cool and sneaker culture. So our buyers and our merchants do a great job of working with our vendor partners to bring in assortments that resonate with our consumers. The consumer moves very quickly, so our team has to be very nimble and adjust on-the-fly so to speak. So I'm less focused on categories, we're less focused on categories than we are making sure that we have the assortment that is really stimulating the consumers engage with us as a brand.","So from an ASP perspective, they do a great job of managing that as well, and we're not talking about trading $200 signature basketball shoes for $49 shoes, we're talking about a lot of these casual silhouettes still being elevated in price points and our focus is really on the premium area of sneaker culture, and the consumer is definitely responding to that. So I don't \u2013 Lauren, you may want to comment on ASP mix, but I don't see any changes in the back half.","Lauren B. Peters","No, I mean the trend has been there for quite a while now that ASPs have been up as the customer has voted for these shoes, but if they feel they are not really good price to value if that price has been, if they are elevated. That coupled with all of the really good work that we're doing on improving our allocation to get the right product to the right place at the right time and keeping control of the inventory growth, that too has fueled lower markdowns. Therefore, that is a bit of a higher ASP as well. But our merchants are very thoughtful about the assortments across price line and to make sure that we are bringing compelling product and it's not skewed to the point that we are pricing folks out.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow-up, on gross margin, what was the breakdown this quarter between merch margin and occupancy, and does this 10 to 30 basis points guide for the year still stand? Just trying to think about the best way to think about 3Q and 4Q between merch margin and occupancy.","Lauren B. Peters","So we had our flat Q1 40, and Q2, which was really driven by underlying merchandise margins, we had a bit of a delever on occupancy. We have this dynamic of some couple of properties here in New York that were closed on sales and you got rent. So there is a little bit of a delever there. So as we look that full of year, that 10 to 30 that we guided to still make sense.","Operator","Mitch Kummetz from B. Riley & Co. is on line with a question.","Mitch Kummetz","You talked a little bit about ASPs, ASPs were up in the quarter and I think there's maybe just a general concern out there that that slips over time if some of those basketball products come out at a lower price point and maybe there is a shift mix more towards classics at a lower price point. Could you just talk about how you see that playing out?","Richard A. Johnson","Mitch, the ASPs are, I've said this for three or four quarters now because that concern seems to be out there, but the ASP formula algorithm is really complex. So a shift in basketball can be offset by lower markdowns. It can be offset by elevated Stan Smiths or Superstars. So our team, I can't give them enough credit. They do a great job of mixing price points across footwear, across apparel, across accessories. And you combine the great assortments that they put in play across those price points, across those categories, and you combine that with great inventory management that Lauren mentioned, and having the right product in the right store at the right time so we don't have to mark as much product down, puts us in a position that continues to drive the premium end of the market which keeps the ASPs at the level that we're at and growing. So I can't do much about the concern that you all see. I can just rely on what our buyers, our merchants and our vendor partners do to the mix of product that we sell to our consumers.","Mitch Kummetz","And this is a quick follow up to that, because you talked about markdowns. I'm curious, if you got like a KD 9 MSRP like $150 versus the old one at $180 or maybe a new LeBron at $175 versus $200, is that ultimately better for you because your out-the-door price is probably closer to MSRP versus maybe the older version even though at a higher MSRP, maybe you are marking that down more, is that how to think about it also?","Richard A. Johnson","That's one element certainly. Again, if there were just a straight A plus B equals C sort of formula, we might share that. I'm not sure that we would, but we might. But certainly that's one way to look at it. The great product that stimulates the customer to buy it at the premium price points is good for us and the less markdowns that we have to spend to move out of product, whether it would be seasonally or because of sales performance, the better that is for our gross margin line. So when you combine all of that, certainly having great products across all of the price points is one of the things that allows our ASPs to stay elevated.","Mitch Kummetz","Okay. And then, Lauren, just real quick follow-up on merch margin, I know it was up in the quarter, you talked about lower markdowns, where did IMU come in and how will you think about IMU over the balance of the year?","Lauren B. Peters","The IMU has really stabilized and it has been pretty stable for the last several quarters, and we are past the point where shift in category and brand mix is impacting the IMU.","Mitch Kummetz","Okay, all right. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Operator","John Kernan from Cowen and Company is on line with a question.","John Kernan","Congrats on a very strong quarter, both on the top line and the bottom line. So SG&A isn't levering at this point on 5% comps in Q2. You're guiding it fairly flat for the year. And one of the things we continue to hear is the theme of higher wages and minimum wages inevitably going to move significantly higher in California and New York. So I'm just wondering how labor costs factor into your long term margin structure and your ability to leverage SG&A?","Lauren B. Peters","Obviously the results and the guidance that we gave, we factored in what we see happening with minimum wage and the change to overtime exemption, et cetera, but the reason why we are pleased with our wage compensation structure, it includes a commission element that's helpful to our stores so that they will award those who are better salespeople. They have the ability to determine their wage and significantly earn above minimum wage. They are good sales bucks. So that helps us manage that.","But also the reason that we continue to invest in things that give us some productivity advantages in the store, things like the processing of inventory, trying to make that more efficient so that we can focus the hours on sales activity as opposed to stock keeping activity, all of those are things that we work on to be able to manage that wage rate, and as I described, we felt very good about how selling wages came out and the leverage that we had on that.","John Kernan","That's helpful. Thanks. You also talked a little bit about adidas. Obviously the inflection there has been pretty substantial. Can you talk about your ability to get increased allocations around some of the NMDs that were just launched, the Boost technology that's been coming out, both in running and basketball?","Richard A. Johnson","We are on a nice run with adidas absolutely, John, and getting the allocations relates to the great relationship that we have with all of our vendor partners, and right now in several markets, no matter what retailer you talk to, they would tell you that they don't have enough of the best product. But that's one of the things that our vendor partners really do is they control the scarcity model, they pump in the appropriate number of shoes. Our merchants would always like more. They like to feed at the trough when something's hot, but the vendor partners do a good job of controlling the flow into the marketplace and keeping that ever-present demand out there. And I think it helps to keep the heat in our industry, it helps to keep the consumer excited about getting the next. So by and large, it's a good thing and we continue to work with all of our vendor partners to increase our allocations and the storytelling that we do in the store to connect better with the consumer and connect them with the product stories.","John Kernan","That's helpful. And then just finally, you bought back a ton of stock this quarter, took advantage of a cheap valuation with the stock. What should we expect for the share count at year-end and the level of share repurchase for the remainder of the year?","Lauren B. Peters","We have a very balanced approach to our capital allocation. The number one priority is investing in our business. Hence, what we've described as elevated capital with our remodel program and digital efforts around giving the customers a great store experience, whether they come into the stores or digital, and that investment is part of what we're doing to get after our long-term objectives. So priority number one is that investment. But we are very committed to returning cash to our shareholders in both a strong dividend program and an active share repurchase. At this point, we have $361 million remaining on our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. It is not formulaic, so I can't describe something to you that would help you with that model, but you can see we recognized good value.","John Kernan","Okay, thanks. Best of luck.","Operator","Susan Anderson from FBR Capital Markets & Co. is on line with a question.","Susan Anderson","Congrats on a good quarter also. I was wondering if you could drill down a little bit on the women's business. When do you think you are going to be able to get more fashionable products in the stores that kind of turn that around? And then also, is there anything going on out there in the competitive environment that you also think is impacting this, such as maybe a quieter product, there's obviously been an influx of competitors, so maybe just kind of drill down on the outlook there?","Richard A. Johnson","Sure. From a store count perspective, Susan, we have announced or we have talked about the last few quarters that we slowed down our store development here in 2016 because we've got two very significant properties that we are going to open in New York City to give our SIX:02 banner a real presence in the city, and that's for 34th Street store that we'll see open in the next couple of weeks and then Times Square which will have a SIX:02 shop within it that will open hopefully by the end of the year. So, that was a decision that we made to slow down the store rollout to make sure that we get those two doors right.","The SIX:02 team has done a great job of bringing in some new brands, catching up with the lifestyle side of the equation. Again, this female consumer that we are after is very discerning in that she expects all of the performance elements to be present in every piece that she buys, everything that she buys, but it's got to be very stylish. And we have got some great new brands, and the best place to sort of see and measure the progress if you're not near a SIX:02 store is on six02.com and you can see some of the great showcased product that we've got there.","So the intent would be to make sure that we've got the assortment right with some of the exciting things that we are going to see in 34th Street and Times Square. We've got the physical space right. And then we'll likely accelerate door count when we get into 2017.","And we've said all along that this is a really competitive marketplace. So, yes, I mean the fashion is changing, the look is changing, the response and reaction to some of the asset-driven models are changing. So she's a very discerning, very quick moving customer and we are trying to capture her interest and get her engaged with the SIX:02 brand. It's been a little bit difficult with only 30 doors. So I'm a firm believer that the excitement that's going to be generated out of the doors here in the city will certainly give a big momentum push, as will some of the good work that we're going to do with some of our key vendor partners in the SIX:02 space to drive real energy around that banner.","Lauren B. Peters","I am encouraged because where we brought those customers the special product, she has really responded very well. I think that the team is obviously in good start.","Susan Anderson","Great, sounds good. And if I could just fill one more in there on the Olympics, maybe if you could talk about if you've seen anything yet in terms of consumers getting excited around the Olympics and the product and maybe just historically kind of what you're seeing in terms of the benefit as you kind of flow through the quarter and afterwards?","Richard A. Johnson","There is always, I've talked about it before, Susan, that the level of patriotism and the focus around sport and the excitement is driven by things like the Olympics, like the World Cup, like the NBA Playoffs. And it may or might not be a direct connection or correlation to the product but a lot of the product that you're seeing on the Olympians' feets and bodies will certainly be commercialized in the back half of the year and into next year, maybe not at the same price points that the special product for the Olympians has been built to, but at price points that are meaningful and commercializeable in our stores.","So there is excitement around the Olympics certainly. We have some very clear country related and Olympic colored product in the stores and there's been great response to that, but that's not what really moves the needle. It's the after effect and you'll see some of that great \u2013 if you've been watching on either track and field, there's an awful lot of great Nike product on the feet of a lot of the sprinters and distance runners that will certainly be in the Eastbay catalog. Same thing with the stuff from adidas and Puma, obviously Puma with \u2013 you've seen Bolt in the great performance that he's had, the branding presence that you've seen from Under Armour, all those things are going to be positives to the business in the back half of the year.","Susan Anderson","Great. Very helpful. Good luck next quarter.","Operator","Omar Saad from Evercore ISI is on line with a question.","Omar Saad","Great quarter, guys. Wanted to ask about, I think you made a comment upfront about the women's business on the apparel side seeing a shift away from performance towards more of the fashion product. Can you maybe elaborate on that and help us understand what's going on there?","Richard A. Johnson","The consumer that we are really trying to attract in the SIX:02, she expects the performance elements to be built in. So again, she is still very active, she wears it to the classes that she goes to, whether it's yoga, spin or out for a run, whatever, but it just is more fashion led. There is the influence from some of the style leaders out there in the marketplace today that require it to be more than just a basic garment. It's got to perform, that's the expectation, but it's got to look great and help her project that athletic fashion image that she is really after.","Lauren B. Peters","So it makes a lot of sense, right. If she is wearing it everywhere, she wants it to look really good and special, and looking to us as a specialty retailer, we got to bring her special. It needs to be something different that she can't find everywhere else.","Richard A. Johnson","And while our core athletic brands are certainly making a lot of progress in that area, there is brands like Kalala and Corelle and Spiritual Gangster that are in SIX:02 that really bring the fashion twist to this performance product. So it's not a lack of performance or a real shift from the performance, it's just that the performance expectation is built into her mindset when she buys the garment.","Omar Saad","Got you. Actually, it's really helpful. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask on the broader, on the footwear side, there's been so much talk about a shift from performance to more sports fashion, sneakers, how do you see this trend? Do you see a shift, is it supplemental, is it complementary, how do you see consumer behavior evolving around sneakers essentially across categories?","Richard A. Johnson","It's a good question and the facts are that most of the basketball shoes that we sell never see a basketball court, most of the running shoes that we sell never see the roads or the trails of the track to run in, they just look really good and they are part of the sneaker culture that we really support. So as our vendors continue to bring heat across the categories, whether it's deemed a performance shoe or a lifestyle shoe, our core consumers, the people that we really, that are at the sharp point of our muse work, they don't really distinguish things like that, they are really more focused on how does it look, what message does it send to the people that I hang out with, et cetera. So as long as people are talking about it and wearing and in love with sneakers, we continue to support the sneaker culture that certainly across the markets that we are in is a significant part of today's pop culture, and I think it will be going on.","Lauren B. Peters","And it's self perpetuating too, right. I mean, if you think about adults today grew up with sneakers and they are getting ever more discerning at an earlier age about the nuances between the different sneakers. I think you see that in the results at our kids' business. So they fall in love at an early age and they are not falling out of love with the category.","Operator","Michael Binetti from UBS is on line with a question.","Michael Binetti","Let me add my congrats on a great quarter. I know a lot of the questions have been answered here. Let me ask you about Runners Point group for a second. It sounds like you feel that was partly the market in Germany, but last quarter I think you were a bit more concerned about few of the specific challenges to your own brands in that business. Could you just maybe help us kind of revisit that a little bit, aside from the market, what do you think is missing in your business that you guys need to do to kind of steady the ship there?","Richard A. Johnson","It's a good question, Michael, and certainly Q2 I would chuck a part of the toughness to the market in Germany because none of our banners performed well in the economy with some of the traffic issues that we saw. But from a broader perspective, we're repositioning both Runners Point and Sidestep and we did some \u2013 you know how we operate, we test things pretty significantly before we go ahead and roll them out and the tests that we saw back in 2014, where we positioned Runners Point with all things running and Sidestep more on the lifestyle end of the spectrum with our Foot Locker banner right in between, the results in 2014 were pretty positive and they convinced us that we could go ahead with that.","In the hindsight, what we found is there were a couple of really significant silhouettes that were driving the running side of the business, especially in Germany. Each market in Western Europe is different and Germany was definitely locked down to a couple of key silhouettes that had fallen out of favor there. So it really caused, firstly fired a bunch of customers from runners point because we took out the vulcanized shoes, we took out the skate shoes, we took out the boots, and we really focused it on the running consumer. And then that running consumer moved off a couple of the key silhouettes that had really been propping up the results. So it's an assortment mix, it's a brand mix, and I think the team in Recklinghausen is addressing it as quickly as they can with the vendor partners.","And then the other piece is on the Sidestep side of the house making sure that we've got the right lifestyle piece of it in a little bit more fashion forward. So we've got work to do there but the team is diligently working on it. We spent a little time over in Germany this summer and we see some progress, but we do definitely have work to do.","Michael Binetti","Okay, that's very helpful. And back on your commentary about women's, if we go back a few years, there's been a few starts and stops in that business, it sounds like you're fairly high conditioned that it's a product issue right now, the teams are working on it, but it seems like longer term the reality is that the demand in that category changes in a much different cadence than what it used to in your men's business. Looking at that, and as you mentioned, we had pause on the store reopening, what you are thinking about how much capital you want to deploy behind the women's business over the longer term knowing that it's a more volatile category and that it changes quite frequently and these product issues seem to be a bit guardrail to guardrail more than the men's business?","Richard A. Johnson","We are definitely committed to the SIX:02 brand and the amount of capital, Michael, we'll figure out as we keep moving forward. We have to get a little brand recognition out there. We have to make sure that we have got our target mused in the right asset led and scarcity model. She's not that different from our male consumer once we get the right product assortment in. We've found when we bring the right product assortment in that's asset-led and it's a little bit scarce, she's very reactive to that and very much \u2013 in those moments, she looks very much like our male consumer. But we have to win her every day and that's where the shifts that you referred to that we've talked about are critical that our team is on those.","So we're certainly supportive and 100% behind the SIX:02. When we get more brand recognition and momentum as we get through these openings in New York City in 2017 and 2018, we'll look different from a capital investment perspective for her I'm sure.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot, guys. Very helpful.","John A. Maurer","All right, I think we have time for just one more question.","Operator","Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank is on line with a question.","Paul Trussell","Congrats. Wanted to just follow-up on the remodels. You guys mentioned that you were around 30% complete of the store base globally, any metrics that you are able to provide for us at this time on four wall or comps or returns relative to the rest of the store base? And then also as we think about exclusivity because of your House of Hoops banner, I think it's well understood the partnership that you have on the basketball side with Nike. Maybe you can just give us a little bit more color around your mix of exclusives with Nike on non-basketball products and the same with other vendors such as adi, Under Armour, PUMA, et cetera?","Richard A. Johnson","Couple of things, Paul, going back to the first part of your question, we don't break out the exact performance of the remodels because each of them performs a little bit differently, but I can tell you that the remodels outperformed the balance of the chain and in totality they surpassed all of the hurdles that we have from a financial point of view, from a capital investment point of view. So again, I really would want to stop remodelling at that first one that doesn't pass out all those hurdles appropriately. I'm not sure that anybody in the organization has that good a crystal ball to tell us which one that's going to be. So we continue to be investing in that program, as Lauren talked about.","I guess I'd also point out that beyond the House of Hoops, that's certainly our biggest partnership program with our vendors, but we've got vendor partnerships across multiple brands, we've got the Armoury with Champs Sports and Under Armour, we've got Flight 23 in Jordan shops with Footaction, we've got the Fly Zone with KFLs and Nike, and those are open around the globe. We've got the Collective with adidas. And they are all committed to bringing fresh new exclusive product into those spaces.","So I'm not going to get into the amount of exclusives that we've got in each of those, but commitment that we have made, we sign the lease, we share the buildout cost, they deliver great product, some of it exclusive, some of it with time leads, et cetera, we do the servicing and the storytelling in the stores and we have great partnerships that continue to fuel sneaker culture. So they are all working and we are very positive about the vendor partnerships.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. And then just a follow up, apparel comped positive as well this quarter, you mentioned that I believe units were down, ASPs were up, maybe just help us better understand for your men's customer, your teen customer, what is it that they are attracted to on the apparel side currently and how do you feel in terms of your positioning and your assortment going forward?","Richard A. Johnson","We've had a great run in fleece on the high-end, the tech fleece, et cetera, I mean not so much in Q2 but still the kid was buying, our consumer was buying fleece even in Q2. We've got a great position in windwear going into the fall and we've seen good early results from that, so we are positive about that. We've got the licensed product business in Champs Sports at the level that we wanted to be and they are having a nice run with licensed product where they are able to chase and fill in on the right team, the right player, et cetera, the right sport moment. Dad hats are a winner on the accessories side. So there's a lot of things that are interesting the consumer right now, graphic tees, the right graphic tees, some of them are sports moment led, some of them are culturally led and some of them are just brand reads that our consumers are after, and the apparel is so much different in each of our banners that there is winners and obviously some things that aren't quite as positive in each of the banners, but it goes across the full spectrum, Paul.","Lauren B. Peters","It does, and our merchants are doing a great job of really tuning in to their local customer and what appeals to their local customer in apparel and assorting to it, and I think that's one of the things that we're seeing show up in the apparel results.","Paul Trussell","Great. Congrats guys. Good luck.","Richard A. Johnson","John, before you jump in, I just want to make sure that we call out and have the people of Louisiana in our thoughts. We've got a bunch of teammates down in Louisiana that have been flooded out and we know that they are working hard to put their lives back to normal but it's something we should all think about and remember.","John A. Maurer","Okay. Thanks, Dick. Thanks for everybody's participation today. If we didn't get to your question or if you have a follow-up, I'll be back at my desk shortly. Please join us for our next earnings call, which we anticipate will take place at 9 AM on Friday, November 18, following the release of our third quarter results earlier that morning.

Maurer","Thank you, and welcome to Foot Locker's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. The fourth quarter results we reported yesterday afternoon include net income of $81 million or $0.53 per share on a GAAP basis. This represents an increase of 47% over the $0.36 per share we earned in the fourth quarter of 2010. It also represents our eighth consecutive quarter of sales and profit increases over the comparable prior year period. Our fourth quarter results include net noncash charges of $0.02 per share in 2011 and $0.03 a share in 2010, both primarily related to non-amortizing intangible assets of our CCS business. We have excluded these charges in a non-GAAP comparison that was included in yesterday's press release. And during the course of the call, we intend to refer primarily to the non-GAAP results.","On this non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.55 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $0.39 per share a year ago, an increase of 41%. On a GAAP basis for the full year, we earned a record $278 million, equivalent to $1.80 per share, an increase of 68% over last year's earnings of $1.07 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $1.82 per share, 65% higher than 2010.","Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will start off our prepared remarks this morning with additional details about our fourth quarter financial results. Ken Hicks, our Chairman and CEO, will then discuss various aspects of the success we are having as we implement the key initiatives of our strategic plan. ","Before we get to your questions at the end, we will provide some initial perspectives on the outlook for 2012. However, keep in mind that we are hosting an investor meeting at our New York offices on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. During that meeting, which will also be webcast, we will provide an update to our long-range strategies and financial goals. So we ask that you please focus your question today primarily on our 2011 results for the near-term outlook. ","With that, let me now turn the program over to Lauren Peters.","Lauren B. Peters","Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. We did indeed have another strong results in the fourth quarter, posting non-GAAP earnings of $0.55 per share. This result brought our non-GAAP full year earnings to $1.82 per share, a record for athletics business, and one which all our associates can be very proud of.","To review how we achieved these results, let's start as usual with sales. We achieved a 7.5% comparable sales increase in the fourth quarter on top of our 7.3% comp increase in Q4 2010. The 14.8% 2 years stack increase was similar to the mid-teens stacked comp we posted through the third quarter this year. For the full year, we posted a strong 9.8% comparable sales increase.","Total sales for the full year, which were helped by stronger foreign currencies but reduced by net store closures, were up 11.4%. Almost all of our divisions recorded comp sales increases in the fourth quarter. Our Direct-to-Customers segment led the way with a 16% gain. Excluding ccs.com, which was the only division with a comp loss, the rest of the segments, which includes Eastbay and our store banner dot-com sites, was up more than 20%, a level achieved in all 4 quarters of the year.","Among the store divisions, Champs Sports delivered a very strong year with a Q4 comp gain in the mid-teens, successfully comping against a similarly strong gain last year. Foot Locker in the U.S. was up high single digits, as were Foot Locker Canada and Foot Locker Asia-Pacific. Total sales in Foot Locker Europe were up mid single digits in the fourth quarter, although the comp gain was only slightly positive. European consumers, especially our target young customers, continued to be challenged by slow or negative economic growth and high unemployment. ","The quarter played out with the strongest comp gain in December, but each of the months in the quarter delivered at least strong mid single digit growth. All families of business had solid comp gains with apparel and accessories once again achieving double-digit gains.","Within footwear, Men's and Kids posted high single digit gains, while our Women's business was flat. In Men's, we produced healthy increases across our major categories of basketball, running and casual. Even our boot business posted a gain overall despite warmer-than-average temperatures in many of our markets. Apparel comp gains in the fourth quarter were in the low double digits. We have found success in utilizing our apparel presentations to highlight the banner differentiation we have worked hard to execute. By improving the apparel assortments and in-store displays, we find that we can sell both more apparel and more shoes. Almost all the brands have done a good job improving the hookup of their shoes and apparel, with an excellent example of being the Adicolor program from Adidas and Champs. ","Our gross margin rate increased by 110 basis points on the fourth quarter, off the pace from the first 3 quarters of the year, but solid nonetheless given the improvements from last year that we have begun to anniversary. Most of the gain, 100 basis points, was due to the leveraging of our predominantly fixed buying and occupancy expenses. 10 basis points of the gross margin expansion was due to merchandise margin improvement. Across our divisions, our merchandise margin performance ran in a fairly tight range, with small gains and declines by banner, family of business and region. Overall, we made more progress in footwear and accessory margins than apparel margins.","One call-out in apparel is the branded apparel outperformed, which should be our higher-margin private label business. While this dynamic helps top line sales, it holds back apparel margins. As a result, while margins rose overall, we did not close the gap between footwear and apparel margins during the quarter. We will continue to work on opportunities for incremental margin improvements in both categories.","SG&A expense improved 20 basis points in the fourth quarter, from 21.8% of sales to 21.6%. On a dollar basis, SG&A expense increased $22 million, including $7 million for our elevated marketing program, which we believe have been successful in bringing the right customers into our stores and onto our website. The remainder of the increase was primarily a function of variable expenses, such as store wages and supplies that flexed up with higher sales.","We recorded an after-tax charge of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 to write down the value of intangible assets acquired as part of our investment in the CCS business in 2008. We incurred a similar $6 million charge, also related to CCS in the fourth quarter of 2010. The charge in 2010 was partially offset by the recovery of a portion of the short-term investment that had been written down in 2008. As of year end, approximately $10 million of non-amortizing intangible assets related to CCS remain on our books.","Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter was $28 million, up $1 million from the same quarter last year. For the full year, depreciation was $110 million, up from $106 million last year, reflecting the strategic long-term investments we are making in many parts of our business.","As we have mentioned throughout the year, these investments include opening new stores in Europe, maintaining and remodeling our existing fleet of stores, enhancing our digital capabilities, and developing various systems to make us more operationally efficient.","Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate came in somewhat lower than expected at 34%, bringing our full year rate down to 36%, better than our previously estimated annual tax rate of 37%. The improvement was primarily attributable to one-time tax audit settlements and true-up adjustment.","As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, the sum of all this was non-GAAP earnings of $0.55 per share for the quarter and $1.82 for the full year. ","Looking at some of our long-term financial goals, we came close on several key P&L objectives. On our path to achieving sales of $6 billion, we delivered a strong 9.8% comp gain for the year to reach sales of $5.6 billion, up from $4.8 billion when we established those goals 2 years ago. ","We ended the year with 3,369 stores, down 57 from the beginning of the year. Almost 2\/3 of the 70 new stores we opened this year were in international markets, while the majority of the 127 stores we closed were in the U.S. Of course, the benefit of eliminating unproductive stores is that it enabled us to make further progress on other financial metrics. For example, we achieved an EBIT margin of 7.9%, our best ever and just short of our long-term objective of 8%. In addition, we delivered a net income margin equal to our long-term goal of 5%. ","From a balance sheet perspective, we significantly elevated the productivity of our largest and most important asset, our inventory. Merchandise inventory dollars were up less than 1% at year end even with the consistently strong sales gains we produced throughout the year. Inventory turns are improving, and we ended 2011 with inventory aging at record levels of freshness across the company. ","We continue to position ourselves well to respond to the strong demand we see in the marketplace for athletics, footwear and apparel and see no near-term risk of inventory becoming too lean. In fact, within the year-end inventory figure were some receipts we brought in early, specifically to help drive February sales results, which I am pleased to report comped up in the mid-teens on top of last year's strong 11.6% comp gain in February.","We ended the year with $851 million of cash and short-term investments, an increase of $155 million from the end of last year. This increase was achieved even though we accelerated both our investment in the business and our initiative to return cash to our shareholders.","We spent $152 million in capital in 2011, slightly below the plan of $160 million that we set at the beginning of the year. The shortfall is mainly the result of timing in the completion of certain projects, most of which will be completed in early 2012. ","Over the past 2 years, we have significantly improved the return on the capital we are investing in our business, having hit an ROIC total of 11.8% in 2011, up from just 5.3% in 2009 and above our 5-year plan target of 10%.","The combination of all the productivity initiatives that we have undertaken and discussed with you throughout 2011 has reduced our investment base at the same time that we have significantly elevated the return part of the ROIC equation. As a result, we are earning in excess of our 9% estimated cost of capital.","In terms of returning cash to shareholders, we paid $101 million in dividends in 2011, having increased our annual dividend rate by $0.06 or 10% at the beginning of the year. Last month, we announced an additional 9% increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.18 per quarter. At the same time, we also announced a new $400 million share repurchase program, replacing the prior $250 million program. We have spent approximately $153 million repurchasing shares under the prior program, including $104 million in 2011, which brought in 4.9 million shares.","Clearly, our liquidity position allows us the flexibility to continue executing these 3 main elements of our capital allocation strategy: direct investments in our business; dividends; and share repurchases. ","With that summary, let me turn over the call to Ken, who will provide additional perspective on our accomplishments in Q4 and 2011.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thank you, Lauren, and good morning. Let me also thank everyone for participating on the call this morning. In the fourth quarter, we posted our eighth consecutive quarter of meaningful sales and profit increases, a record of consistency which our entire team of associates is very proud of and, more importantly, focused on continuing. We started 2 years ago by creating a vision, to be the leading global retailer of athletically inspired footwear and apparel. We developed a set of 6 clear strategies, as well as detailed initiatives for accomplishing each strategy, and we established some key financial goals to help us measure our success. But we went beyond that. To harness the power of the entire organization, we knew we couldn't confine our work to a presentation given once and then kept on the shelf to gather dust or reported on to the board once a year. Instead, we continually communicated our vision, strategy and goals to every associate in the company, in every store, distribution center and staff location. The strategies were made clear and straightforward so that each person could see how, what they do fits into the big picture. As a result, we've begun to see the true strength of the Foot Locker team when we all pulled together for the same goals.","A year ago, I characterized our 2010 results as being an inflection point in creating sustainable, increased value for our shareholders. I now believe 2010 was a springboard toward the higher level of performance we achieved in 2011. The strategies our team identified and began implementing 2 years ago have elevated our financial and operational performance to new heights.","First, we have defined and differentiated our banners by broadening our product assortments. We continue to be the leading destination for basketball, a category that is growing in terms of both its performance and lifestyle appeal. Marquee basketball was highlighted in the quarter by the Jordan Concord launch just before Christmas. The basketball has grown into a year-round business on the strength of several key active star players, most of whom such as LeBron, Kobe, Rose, KD, Howard and Chris Paul are all playing quite well this season.","During the same time that we solidified our position in basketball, we also built a more powerful running selection. While we've always been a strong player in running, our efforts have made us a much stronger, more significant player in this category. During the quarter, we had especially good results from the Max Air programs from Nike, as well as their Lightweight, Free and Lunar lines. Our core vendors, including Nike, Adidas and Reebok, are doing well. In addition, our performance running vendors, such as New Balance, ASICS, Brooks and Saucony, are also bringing excitement to the running category.","We've also grown our offering of casual footwear. We had standout performances from Jordan Classics, Converse and Adi classics such as the Samoa. Retro style such as the Griffey, Nomo and others are also doing well.","We have just begun our efforts to tell exciting and effective marketing stories that bring customers to our banners. For example, Foot Locker's position this past month of February is the hottest month ever. And as Lauren mentioned, we had double-digit sales gains on top of the double-digit gains we produced last February.","Second, we've begun building our apparel assortments to be much stronger and we've achieved year-over-year apparel growth in the teens, including this quarter. We've had particular success, again, as Lauren mentioned, partnering with the key brands to deliver improved branded apparel assortments tailored to appeal to the target customers of each of our banners and each of our store locations. We've also taken meaningful steps to elevate our private label apparel and had some success, such as with our Actra Women's brand and Champs Sports gear, but we're still learning and developing this business and we have opportunities to improve in many areas.","Third, we continue to make our stores and digital sites more exciting places to shop and buy. In many of our stores, we've realigned the presentation of product along the shoe walls and on the floor in order to increase productivity. And we've integrated our apparel assortments with a footwear in order to tell compelling functionality and color stories. We're testing an exciting new store format in Champs, and we're designing a new format for Foot Locker in the United States. We also opened our first Locker Room store in Brent Cross outside London in the fourth quarter. The store is not far from some of the venues for the upcoming summer Olympic Games in the U.K. The Locker Room is focused on performance product rather than fashion, and we're excited about these prospects. In the digital world, we've upgraded the features and functionality of our Internet mobile sites, significantly improving the cross channel experience. Our customers are increasingly comfortable, switching back and forth between our stores and online, in their relationship with us. And we continue to innovate in order to deepen our connection with them. These innovations have been recognized by others. For example, our Eastbay site has been recognized by Internet Retailer magazine as the best mobile optimized site of the top 100 internet retailers. And the Sneakerpedia website that we launched last year won the Gold Lions Award in the Cyber category at the 2011 Cannes of Festival Creativity. Just last week, we relaunched our ccs.com website and continue to take steps to strengthen that brand with a strong board lifestyle approach.","Fourth, we said we would aggressively pursue growth opportunities, and we have. We have driven strong double-digit growth in our store banner dot-com sales all year, including the fourth quarter. Our total Direct-to-Customers segment posted sales that were about 11% of total sales in the fourth quarter, a new high. We had over 64 million visitors to our websites in the quarter, and we have millions of fans on our Facebook and Twitter sites. Backing out Eastbay from the Direct-to-Customer total suggests that we still have plenty of opportunity to increase the penetration of our online business. We also accelerated our new store openings in Europe, including entering our 23rd country, Poland, in December. Our House of Hoops shops have also been quite successful, and we now operate more than 50 of these stores, including several in key international markets.","Fifth, our productivity metrics have improved across the board. Lauren mentioned some of them. But in addition, we achieved sales of $406 per gross square foot, ahead of our $400 long-term objective. We also saw improvements in such measures as customer conversion, sales per payroll hour and profit flow-through. Through a combination of improved in-store results and closing underperforming stores, we significantly improved the productivity of our fleet.","Sixth and finally, we built on our industry-leading retail team. One of the things I'm especially proud of is how seamlessly we executed the major leadership changes announced during the summer of 2011 to better position us for the future. We have a deep management lineup. Nonetheless, we have upgraded key talent management processes, such as executive development and succession planning in both field and our headquarter's organizations. We've revamped associate selling skills training, focused on meeting our customer needs and above all, we've developed, communicated and reinforced our company's core values.","That, in a nutshell, is what we did over the last couple of years. We posted very strong financial results in 2011, which was the best year in our company's history as Foot Locker, Inc. But I realize that what you want to know about, what's really important to you, is the future. As John mentioned and I'm sure most of you know, we're hosting an investor meeting and webcast this coming Tuesday, at 9:00 a.m., to discuss our new goals for the future and the evolution of the strategies that we will execute to achieve these goals. I'm not going to scoop that meeting, but before we get to your questions, I'd like to let Lauren discuss some of our early thoughts on 2012.","Lauren B. Peters","Thanks, Ken. Let me start by saying that one of our key goals for 2012 was to produce double-digit percentage profit growth for the full year and for each individual quarter compared to 2011. The goal is not dependent on the fact that 2012 includes a 53rd week, which should add about $0.10 per share to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. We've had a very strong sales run over the past 2 years. So looking ahead, we are planning 2012 comp gains in the mid single digit range. We have planned for all of our divisions to be comp positive for the year. ","The only division that is significantly off that mark right now is Foot Locker Europe, which has gotten off to a difficult start in the quarter. Comps in Europe are running down high single digits, but we believe some of these results is due to exceptionally cold and snowy weather in Europe recently, which led to numerous store closures. We remain optimistic for the current year with new product, expanded assortments that are selling well and major sporting events taking place in Europe all likely to support our business. We are also confident about the long-term prospects of our profitable European business.","We are planning for a 30 to 40 basis point gross margin gain in 2012 based on a 52-week year. We expect to continue to leverage our fixed costs. However, incremental merchandise margin gains will take time, given the tremendous strides we have already made over the past 2 years and the less than robust economic conditions we faced, especially in our biggest markets, the U.S. and Europe. ","Fortunately, the lean inventory position that I mentioned earlier enables us to maintain the flow of exciting new products from a wide variety of vendors, including Nike, Adidas, Reebok, Converse, ASICS, Under Armour, New Balance and several others. We intend to build on a solid foundation of improvements we have made in merchandise flow, which should keep markdown rates low and margins up.","As always, we will control our expenses carefully, SG&A expense as a percent of sales improving 60 to 80 basis points, but we are not planning to scrimp on telling our brand stories or investing in our business. Our capital program in 2012 is planned to be about $160 million. ","We plan to open 82 new stores and close 75 stores in 2012, which would be the first time in many years that we open more stores than we close. ","We expect depreciation to be about the same level in 2012 as it was in 2011, around $110 million depending on exchange rates.","Finally, our 2012 tax rate is planned at 37%. ","With that outlook, I'll turn the call back to Ken.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Lauren. To add some color to the numbers that Lauren just gave you, let me say that we're excited about the way 2012 is shaping up. As mentioned, February was a hot month, getting us off to a fast start with a lot of really strong basketball releases from Nike, Jordan and Adidas. Meanwhile, the basketball business -- the base basketball business is also doing very well. Our technical and performance running businesses, including lightweight, are strong as is the casual business. We see a lot of exciting innovations still to come in all of these footwear categories in terms of fabrications, colorways, silhouettes and treatments.","As we noted, our apparel business is getting better in almost all of our divisions and we intend to apply the lessons we're learning in order to maintain this momentum. ","Our accessories business is also solid, with a strong demand for Nike Elite Socks, Snapback hats from New Era and other key performance and lifestyle products.","Before I get to your questions, let me wrap up our prepared remarks by once again acknowledging the tremendous effort and teamwork of all of our associates during 2011. As a result of their hard work, we approached or surpassed many of the peak financial and operating metrics the company has ever achieved at Foot Locker. While we salute a very good performance in 2011, a win, if you will, one of the key strengths of our team is its clear focus on the future and wanting to win consistently. We see opportunities for improvement in many areas of our business, and we recognize that some other retailers have even better metrics than we do in certain areas. We want to seize our opportunities, win again, and become a true champion.","Thank you. Operator, let's open the call now for questions, if you will.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Zolidis from Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of questions. One, could you give us the cash flow metrics, both operating cash flow and free cash flow for the year? And then in that context, could you discuss why the share repurchase hasn't been more aggressive? And then the second question is on just the merchandise margins and the private label apparel business and can -- maybe a little flesh out a little bit more whether you still see 100 bps or -- of opportunity there over the long term.","Kenneth C. Hicks","I'll let Lauren talk about the cash flow for 2011. Do you have it?","Lauren B. Peters","John is going take the cash flow over '11.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. while we're pulling up some numbers, on the stock buyback, we constantly evaluate what is appropriate -- the appropriate level and we make those decisions on an ongoing basis. And we decided what we bought in the fourth quarter was the appropriate amount. And we will continue to make those evaluations as we go forward based upon what we think is appropriate.","John A. Maurer","And so the free cash flow total in 2011 was around $338 million. And you also asked, John, about the operating cash flow, did you?","John Zolidis - Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes, if you have it.","John A. Maurer","Yes, it's about $490-ish.","Kenneth C. Hicks","The merchandise margin opportunity is going forward. Obviously, between 2010 and 2011, we made a number of promotional changes that were positive on the merchandise margins. And most of those events are out of the system. And we see continued merchandise margin opportunities as we go forward that are coming from working with our vendors on product, on better sell-throughs, and doing a better job in planning and allocating product. And one of the things that we're doing now is looking at what we can do to improve the allocations and planning systems that we have. And that's something that is -- we talk about our future strategy that we'll be working on. Lauren, I don't know if you have any -- and then the other thing is, obviously, leverage based upon on our sales.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, that clearly delivers a lot.","John A. Maurer","By the way, I have an exact number for the operating cash flow for 2011. It's at $497 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rafe Jadrosich - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is a actually Rafe Jadrosich on behalf of Bobby. Just in terms of your comp guidance for next year, can you just give a breakout of your assumptions for ASP versus unit?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We see both growing.","Rafe Jadrosich - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then have you seen any resistance to price increases so far through, I guess, the first half of this year?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Not -- the customer continues to buy the shoes and where we've taken price increases. And obviously, we've seen more as each months goes by. The customer has responded favorably, as indicated by our February results.","Rafe Jadrosich - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the last question, can you just give a little more color about what's driving the strength at Champs? I mean, and do you see a bigger opportunity with the NFL license switching over to Nike in April? Or would you be adding more NFL licensed apparel?","Kenneth C. Hicks","With Champs, Champs has obviously been a strong division for us and they are the one that's probably furthest ahead on a number of our initiatives, including the growth of apparel presentation and new formats in the stores. So that's one of the things that makes us optimistic about our growth as we learn from them and apply some of those measures in the other divisions. We think that Nike will reinvigorate the NFL franchise. And we've seen the merchandise. It looks very, very good and very exciting. And we are very proud to be a partner with them as they launch the product, and we feel that we'll be a major player with them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi Investment Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You had mentioned on the last call, Ken, that there's still a lot of room for productivity improvement and inventory despite the negative delta between inventory and sales growth. I think you indicated that again today. Can you give us some more detail on what you expect over the next few quarters with inventory trends? And how much more room do you have to go in reaching your productivity goal?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, as we've said, we are working to get our overall turnup over 3%, and we've moved now basically from 2% to 2.5% this year. And we see the opportunity to do that in working with our vendors, in doing a better job in flowing the merchandise -- Lauren has been a leader in that effort, and in making sure that we have the right systems and tools. And we're doing that as we implement business intelligence systems and look at new planning and allocation systems. We see the opportunity as we increase our dot-com business, and it becomes a bigger proportion of our business that, obviously, provides turn opportunity there, and as we continue to grow our apparel business, because apparel has a faster turn now for us than shoes do. So there are still a number of things that will allow us to be more productive with our inventory without hurting sales. In fact, it should help sales as we get more of the right goods in the right store at the right time with the right size and the right quantity.","Lauren B. Peters","We're able to reduce the lead time. I mean, the time from placing the order to selling it to a customer. We're getting closer to demand. That will help.","Kenneth C. Hicks","So the improved turns will help sales and help productivity.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question is on investment in your online business in 2012. Will we see more SG&A dollars and\/or CapEx dollars go to enhancing your online platform this year?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, I think you'll continue to see us develop that business more. We've done -- made some significant changes to our online sites, and we continue to work to make them more exciting, more interactive with the customer, more connected to the stores. And so as I've said, we've gotten some recognition, but the real recognition is coming from the customers. They shop more online and connected more with what we do, both online and in the stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Last quarter, Ken, you mentioned the white format at Lady Foot Locker. Could you just give us an update on that test? And also, with the new Champs prototype and you mentioned also one for Foot Locker, when can we look forward to these remodels potentially being rolled out?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we'll talk more about them on Tuesday but -- the white format at Women's -- or at Lady Foot Locker was good, but we think that we probably need to take it beyond that. And we're looking at exactly what that is. We've done some pretty extensive research over the last few months, and we'll be talking more about that on Tuesday. But let it be said that we are going to make a major effort in Women's, and it will involve how the stores look and what they are. With regard to Champs, we've been very pleased with the prototype and we've done exactly what you do with a prototype. You work the bugs out, and we plan to put up about 1 dozen -- or I'm sorry, about 10 more test stores this spring. And so we'll get an evaluation, see how they work and make a financial determination on how fast we should roll out that effort. We are putting in place a couple of prototypes for the Foot Locker store later this spring. And once we've worked the bugs out of them, we'll do the same thing and test and then determine how and what to roll out.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Thanks for that color. And just one other. In terms of fourth quarter merchandise margins, could you just comment on what was the impact from, I would believe, softer sales from cold weather items like fleeces and boots, et cetera?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Actually, we don't sell a lot of outerwear. And as I think Lauren said, our boot business, while not quite as robust as we would have liked, was still positive.","Lauren B. Peters","Positive.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. So we did okay in boots. We don't have a lot of outerwear in the U.S. We do in Canada and -- but the fleece actually worked very, very well because it was great fleece weather. So it helped our apparel business in keeping it in the double digits. And we didn't have -- we had some things that we had to clear but overall, it was not a big issue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bernard Sosnick from Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","With regard to your extra effort at marketing in the fourth quarter, clearly, it's paid off. But could you give us a little bit clearer idea of how the marketing was spent? You mentioned concentration on digital. And what can we look forward in this new year with respect to the marketing effort and the amount being employed?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We had a multi-pronged approach as we look at our marketing, both in terms of developing more digital and things that were online, so digital related. It may be an email. It maybe a Flash ad. It maybe just doing something on Facebook or Twitter, but we had an effort there. But we also stepped up our television marketing, and having that more directed to building the brand than just talking about an item. We continue to see the opportunity to build the brand banners. We had specific ads for both Champs and Foot Locker that focus on the brands, and we will continue to do that. And then we also spend the marketing on events. We had a number of appearances, and we'll continue to have those appearances with the star athletes and with different things. We had the series we ran with Amare, both working as a striper and then when he came in and resigned, and both of those were tremendously successful. Looking forward, we plan to continue the marketing that we have, and we'll continue to invest in marketing and having it grow as we grow our sales. The marketing rate will remain about the same. But as sales grow, we'll grow the amount that we spend. We also continue to have the key sponsorships that we've had in the past and look forward to continuing those.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","You mentioned that direct was 11% of fourth quarter sales. What did it amount to for the full year?","Lauren B. Peters","9%.","Kenneth C. Hicks","9% for the full year.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how much was that up for the full year? I'm sorry.","John A. Maurer","In terms of percent?","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, total direct.","Kenneth C. Hicks","For the full year, we're up in the 20% range.","John A. Maurer","Over 20%. Total direct including CCS was up 16% in the quarter.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Including CCS. But without CCS, that's over 20%.","John A. Maurer","That's right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michelle Tan from Goldman Sachs.","Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on kind of the push, the puts and takes in your gross margin outlook for 2012. First, I guess, is FX a factor at all? Do you buy for Europe in dollars? Or do you buy for Europe in euros?","John A. Maurer","Predominantly in euros.","Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess, looking at the 40 basis point guidance and mid single digit comps, I would have thought you would have maybe gotten closer to 60 basis points plus of buying an occupancy leverage. So is there something changing a little bit with how the degree to which you can leverage buying occupancy in your comps? Or is there a little bit of give back on merchandise margin? How are you guys thinking about that?","Lauren B. Peters","Well, again, we're -- the guidance was 30 to 40 basis points on a mid single digit comp and we do lever, as you've seen. When we can beat on the top line, we can lever the fixed cost. But as we talked about all last year, there were increases on the cost side that we expected to see in the spring and we are. So that does put pressure. But we still think that with the flow opportunities we have described and apparel opportunities, we will be able to make improvements. They'll be smaller in merchandise margin.","Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just lastly on Europe, I'm not sure if you have visibility on this or not, but do you have any sense of whether what you've seen in the market to your point on snowstorms and whatnot is kind of representative of what broader retail has seen in Europe? Or are you concerned at all that there's anything in terms of product reception or product cycle trends that are playing a role?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we've seen some good selling on the new product that we brought in pretty much across Europe. There has been a slowdown. There's no question that Europe's not as robust as it has been, but it was a little more difficult to read in February and January because they did have -- I mean, we literally had -- at points in time, we might have 100 stores closed because of a storm. But while there has been a slowdown, we continue to be optimistic. But first of all, it's a profitable business for us. But as we look forward, we've got the new product that's selling well. We've got some extensions in some of the businesses that we're doing. And there are some major events this year in Europe that should help drive the business when you look at things, like the Euro Cup and the Olympics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity.","Vincent  Esposito - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","This is Vinnie Esposito on for Camilo. First, can we start with the apparel margins and the business there? What are you thinking as far as the mix of private label as we head forward into 2012 and then beyond? Do you plan on keeping that mix consistent?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We grow what sells. And so we don't set a standard of what a private label or what a branded should be. But what's happened right now is the -- we've had stronger branded merchandise and it has sold better, so we've grown that faster. I just had a product review, I guess, on day before yesterday looking at the private label going forward, and it looks very strong. And I think we will get stronger sales out of that. And the other thing about our private label apparel is we're able, probably, to respond faster than we can in branded because we just -- we have shorter lead line on some of the elements of it. So I think that we will see private label grow. We don't set a percentage, but I think it will grow. The question is, will it grow as fast as what we grow in the branded business? The customer will help determine that for us.","Vincent  Esposito - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And onto Europe and how you're managing the profitably there given the challenges, are you reducing any expenses? What's kind of the puts and takes there?","Lauren B. Peters","We look to flex, right? So we have the ability to flex on the downside as well as when sales are running ahead, flex on the upside. So you control the controllables in that environment. You control your selling wages and control the overhead. You look for opportunities to reduce.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just missed. You said it quickly. The numbers, store openings and closings, and then I have a couple of other questions.","Lauren B. Peters","For 2012?","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","2012, yes.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. Open, 82. Close, 75. Net open, 7.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay, great. A couple questions. The -- involving -- you mentioned that your private label apparel is still underperforming the branded apparel. Is this maybe something where you should be looking maybe at sort of higher average tickets, lower additional markup and building out your branded apparel business rather than trying to build out a private label business and really work up -- work it on an operating income basis for that versus trying to build private label -- or big private label source?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. I mean, we are planning to build the branded business and are stepping it up. And I think we will see that continue to grow. At the same time, what we're doing with our private label business is we were, for all intents and purposes, selling cotton by the pound. And we're shifting from that. And it gives us the ability to provide the customer good quality at a price functionality, and in some cases, fashion and look with either colors or prints or logos for that matter that the customer wants. We've got a line in Europe called Sneaker Freak, and it's a very strong line of T-shirts and fleece. And that's something that we can grow. The Actra line in Women's has been very well received. And the Champs line, which is a higher quality line than we sold in the past, Champs Sports gear, we see that as an opportunity. So we're not growing private label just to grow private label. We're making sure that it fills the need in our assortment and has a place where it can grow along with our branded.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up to that. In the past, really, you've been almost 80% private label. What do you see the balance going to, over time, here?","Kenneth C. Hicks","No. We're nowhere near that level in private label.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No. Not now, but I mean you were a long time...","Kenneth C. Hicks","That I can't speak to. But since I've been here, we've never been near that. And even so, it's probably historically been over half branded. But as I said earlier, we're not looking for percentage. We're looking for the right mix. And at points in time, if the brands are hotter, they will be a larger percentage. If they're not and we're able to provide look and value, then private label will grow. When you set a percentage or -- and go out and buy that way, that usually leads to markdowns.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's fair enough. And then just lastly, Lauren, you talked about gross margin picking up 30 to 40 basis points in total next year?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And that would be -- so you're expecting your merch margin probably to be down. Is that -- am I thinking about that correctly?","Lauren B. Peters","Most of the leverage -- most of the improvement will come from leverage. There will be a little bit of merchandise margin.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then on the SG&A, where are you thinking about -- how are you thinking about your spend there?","Lauren B. Peters","We're looking at 60 to 80 basis point improvement as a rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I just want to recap where we stand with price increases coming through from some of your bigger brands. I think some of those just started recently here or probably influencing that February number. And as we think about how that ties in with the merchandise margin, is that a merchandise margin positive? Is that -- or do the AUCs flex up somewhat in tandem with the AURs on the price increases?","Kenneth C. Hicks","They go somewhat in parallel. We average -- or I won't say we average -- we work with the vendor on certain items. We're able to take up more on certain items. We're holding the price or holding the cost. And so it's difficult to say something across the board. What you see is the percentage change and -- or the percentage we're trying to hold, as you've heard with our plans, is as close as possible. But if the price goes up and the percentage is the same, the dollars go up. So there's that benefit.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Let me ask you one more here and then I have a third follow-up actually. The mid-single digit comp you gave for the year, with Europe down now, pretty substantially but obviously with some noise there, you said you expect that to be positive and we all see the sporting events coming on the horizon this year. But, Ken, for 2 years now, you've had to give us one number that didn't end up being conservative. So at negative Europe at this point, even though we think that can reverse, when you look at that mid-single digit comp, where do you feel like you can make up some ground, if you need to? Where -- maybe in a year from now, where do we look back and say there was potential for some upside there?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Mid single digit comps. We -- I mean, the challenge we have is we know that there will be some businesses that will perform better and some that will perform not quite as well. Right now, where we see the balance, at this point for the year, is in the mid single digits. And to say where -- who's going to perform much better or much worse so early in the game to call exactly, we've got our plans. But as Lauren said, one of our -- one of the things that we've been able to do is respond, both up and down.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned something earlier that caught my attention about hooking up apparel with footwear and you've seen better trends there of bundling and the purchasing. How do you -- is there any way you could give us some kind of a number even if it's pretty general that helps me think about improvements you're seeing in the basket of people coming in and selecting some apparel to throw in with footwear since you've been there? And maybe how you look at -- I think from the sound of it, it sounds like it's something you're looking to be a driver for the year and rightfully so, maybe how you're looking at that for the year ahead.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, we do look at that. We track it at a number of different ways, both in terms of the basket price and the units per transaction. And the different divisions approach it differently because for example, at Champs, they have more apparel and they have more hookups, where Foot Locker may do more accessories like socks and hats to go with it. It also is more difficult to manage because in the past, we may have focused more on hooking up a T-shirt with a pair of shoes. One of the things we're seeing in Champs is they're hooking up a pair of a full tracksuit, a track jacket with the track bottom. And in many cases, we're now selling those 1 to 1, where historically, you'd sell -- it could be 2 to 1 as you look at the tops to bottoms. So I think we're seeing -- we are tracking against that. Those are internal measures, but we're seeing success as we move forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just want to go back to the product margin thought process, particularly on apparel. I know mix is going to have some different dynamics in terms when one branded goes versus the private label piece. But if you think about those 2 silos independently, how are product margins looking as you think about 2012 on the branded piece and on the private label piece? Do they continue to show improvement?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, both do. We're doing a much better job in the back part of the year than the front part of the year on our private label margins. And as we work with the vendors, we're seeing good opportunities there, too.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then on -- when you guys think about Europe for a second -- I don't know if you kind of want to talk to this. But when you think about your mid single digit comp forecast, is that to imply that for the year, the international or European piece would be down slightly and U.S. piece be up mid single, somewhere in that range? I'm just trying to think how Europe falls into that mid single digit forecast.","Lauren B. Peters","We felt good about planning for mid single digit, and it's one of the benefits we have from having a diverse portfolio. So we've said we've got a number of things that encouraged us about Europe's potential, and some things that are working well that we will hope that takes it out of the performance we've seen this February. But we've got other parts of the business that can make up for any shortfall.","Kenneth C. Hicks","As Lauren said in her remarks, we're planning all the major divisions up and just some more up a little more than others. So it's planned out for the year.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just -- Lauren, for you, just one on the guidance, particularly on -- when you talk about gross margin improvement in SG&A leverage, you mentioned also the extra week. Is that included in that gross margins up 30 to 40 and SG&A leverage 60 to 80? Is that extra week embedded in that or no? Is that [indiscernible]?","Lauren B. Peters","No, it is not. The basis point guidance I gave you is on a 52-week basis. So the 53rd week, since it doesn't have occupancy cost associated with it, we'll have better margin with that one week.","John A. Maurer","Okay. Thank you, everyone. That's wrapping up today's call. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at our investor meeting. Please catch the webcast if you can't join us in person. Beyond that, we anticipate holding our first quarter conference Call at 9:00 a.m. on May 18, following the release of our Q1 earnings the previous evening.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views of future events and financial performance.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like turn the call over to John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John Maurer","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone to Foot Locker, Inc.'s earnings conference call for the first quarter of 2016. Thank you for joining us today for the first earnings call from our brand new offices at 330 West 34th Street. It\u2019s been an exciting transition in the last few weeks.","We reported in this morning's press release that the Company achieved record net income of $191 million in the quarter, up from $184 million in the first quarter last year. On a per-share basis Foot Locker earned $1.39 this year, an 8% increase compared with a $1.29 earned in the same period in 2015. It was the highest quarterly net income and EPS result in the Company\u2019s history a significant achievement especially in today's challenging retail environment.","We achieved a comparable sales gain of 2.9% in the quarter. Although this result was a shade below the range of our expectation going into the quarter for a mid single-digit increase, these sales and profits do represent the 25th consecutive quarter of meaningful growth for Foot Locker.","In order to leave as much time as possible for your questions, let me hand the call straightaway to Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to review the results of the quarter in more detail. She will be followed by Dick Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer and newly elected Chairman of the Board to provide product and trend highlights. Lauren?","Lauren Peters","Thank you, John. Good morning to all of you. The first quarter was our best ever. So we\u2019re definitely proud of a very strong result the team produced. That said, we have set the bar even higher than we achieved. So let\u2019s dig in to what worked well and where we fell a bit short.","First, the cadence of our comparable sales was fairly steady during the quarter with the gain landing, as expected, in the mid single-digit range in February. While it was up low single digits in March and April, short of our mid single-digit plans gain. The strong diversity of our assortment and the leadership positions we have in many product categories enabled us to post that 2.9% comp gain despite basketball footwear being down mid single-digit.","In fact, total Company footwear comps were up mid single digits in the quarter with strength in lifestyle running and classic style more than offsetting the decline in basketball shoe sales. Apparel posted a low single-digit gain, while accessories were down high single-digit, primarily the result of the challenging trend in socks.","Proving that with the right product, basketball still performs very well, our strongest division this quarter was Foot Locker Canada, with a comparable sales gain in the high teens. This result was fueled by a strong double-digit gain in basketball footwear. Although the gain was initially propelled by the All-Star game in Toronto this year, Canada\u2019s strong double-digit performance was sustained throughout the quarter and there were meaningful sales gains across the country, not just in Toronto.","Our next strongest store division was Foot Locker Europe, which turned in a high single-digit comparable sales gain on top of last year\u2019s double-digit gain. On the other side of the ledger, Runners Point and Sidestep continue to face assortment challenges with sales in both banners down double-digit from a year-ago.","To round out our international division, Foot Locker Asia-Pacific continued it\u2019s high-level of performance turning in a strong mid single-digit sales gain on top of last year\u2019s gain in the teens. ","Turning to our U.S store division, Champs Sports led the way with a mid single-digit comparable sales increase, Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and our women's division Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 were each up low single-digit.","Footaction posted a comp loss in the high single-digit. There were two primary elements for Footaction\u2019s underperformance in the quarter. First, it has a relatively high penetration at basketball compared to other banners and second, it doesn't offer women's footwear which has been quite a strong contributor to our other banners recently.","In fact for the quarter, women\u2019s comparable footwear sales were up mid single digits, while our sales of kids footwear across the banners that sell children\u2019s product was even stronger, up high single-digit. Sales of men's footwear were down slightly.","Direct-to-customer segment turned in a solid performance with an overall comparable sales gain of 7.3%. Sales of our store banner.com businesses including both domestic and international banners increased more than 20% on top of last year\u2019s almost 40% increase. Eastbay on the other hand declined mid single-digit. The story at Eastbay, which caters to the elite high school athlete remain similar to last quarter, with core performance shoes and apparel trending down relative to the casual assortments in which our store banner site have a stronger position.","Our gross margin rate was flat in the quarter with 30 basis points of merchandise margin improvement offset by slight occupancy to leverage at higher shipping and handling expense. We noted on our previous call, we need to comp at least in the low end of mid-single to leverage occupancy and we fell just short of that for the quarter.","The uptick in merchandised margin was fairly consistent across footwear, apparel, and accessories, driven by lower markdown. As expected, our SG&A rate de-levered slightly to 18.2% of sales in the first quarter, largely due to incurring almost $4 million of expenses related to the new and to our exciting new office space. Without the move costs, our SG&A rate would have held flat at 18%. Thanks to the excellent work of our expense management team.","Depreciation expense increased to $39 million from $35 million in Q1, reflecting the Company\u2019s ongoing investments in enhancing and aligning the customer experience across all of our channel, stores, digital, mobile, and social media.","Our first quarter tax rate was 36% slightly below our expected run rate of 36.5%. Relative to plan, our mix of income in the quarter came proportionately more from Europe where our tax rate is lower than in the U.S.","The record net income we reported for the quarter also led to strong cash flow and we finished the quarter with $1,062 million in cash. The first quarter typically represents our peak cash position with balances subsequently declining until we reach the year-end holiday selling period.","Over time the proportion of our cash held overseas has grown relative to cash in the U.S and just this week we closed on a new $400 million credit facility up from $200 million before. The new expanded facility allows us to maintain our liquidity in the U.S., while continuing to invest in our U.S store fleet and our digital and mobile platform, as well as actively repurchasing shares, funding our dividend program, and being prepared for other opportunities or challenges.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.37 million shares for $87.8 million. We spent approximately $65 million of capital as we continue to track towards our planned expenditures this year of $297 million. An important part of our capital spending this year is to elevate two of our flagship stores in Midtown, Manhattan. Both the 34th Street store below our former office and the Foot Locker store in Times Square closed during the first quarter.","Our exciting new Times Square store will not open until the holiday. The 34th Street store is slated to reopen for back-to-school, but it will be closed during all of Q2 and the lost sales from that high-volume store are enough to reduce our overall comps, a few ticks in the current quarter.","Inventory increased 2.1% at the end of Q1, slightly above our target given the 3.9% sales increase on a constant currency basis. Our inventory remains fresh and productive with turns continuing to tick up towards our long-range goal. Most importantly, we believe our inventory position supports the mid single-digit sales gain, with primarily full price selling that we continue to plan for over the balance of the year.","We continue to believe we can achieve a mid single-digit comp for the full-year, as well as double-digit EPS growth with 10 to 30 basis points of gross margin improvement. We believe that this performance is also achievable in each of the remaining quarters including this one.","As we expected, comp sales are running down month to date, but we\u2019re once again on the negative side of a very significant launch shift. One of the more powerful Jordan releases of this entire year is coming next weekend, whereas last year a similarly strong Jordan release had already happened by this time in the month.","Over such a short period as three weeks the impact of this launch definitely has the potential to lift our May comp well into positive territory. That said, Q2 is already the lowest volume quarter of the year, and this year we have two of our very top stores closed. So SG&A leverage will again be a challenge in the quarter.","As always, we will manage the business tightly not just SG&A, but also inventory and occupancy to maximize our profits this quarter and position ourselves for a strong second half of the year.","Let me hand the call to Dick now to cover the product highlights in more depth and discuss how we see the industry and our business shaping up over the balance of the year.","Richard Johnson","Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. I want to start my remarks today by thanking everyone on the Foot Locker Incorporated team for producing our best, most profitable quarter ever.","As you could tell from Lauren\u2019s remarks there was a lot going on this quarter, with some fast-moving product category shifts, big events like the All-Star game in Toronto, the temporary closure of two of our biggest volume stores here in Midtown, Manhattan, and of course packing everyone up and moving into our brand new offices, although you may hear on the background that we brought some of the sirens with us. With all that, we maintained our focus on execution and produced our strongest quarterly results ever and added another quarter to our streak of consecutive quarters of meaningful sales and profit increases.","My sincere thanks to all the associates at Foot Locker who made it possible. It is only because of the diligent work of the last several years to build and strengthen the diversity of our business in terms of product categories, geographies, families of business and channels that we were able to post a solid comparable sales gain for the quarter in the phase of a mid single-digit decline in basketball.","Although we had planned basketball to be off, the category ended up a bit softer than we had expected, which is the primary reason our quarterly comp gain came in somewhat below our guidance. The basketball business like all our other categories, thrives on newness and innovation and where that was apparent our basketball remains -- basketball business remain strong.","The Jordan brand continues to innovate and produce excellent results with a sports foresight of that brand giving the biggest dollar gains. In fact John here has finally put away his low profile Kobe\u2019s for a cool care of Jordan Horizon\u2019s he brought back from our House of Hoops store in London.","The casual portion of basketball outside of Jordan was also strong, led by models such as Superstars by adi, as well as Foamposites and Air force 1\u2019s from Nike. It was the signature side of the basketball business that saw the biggest decline. Although even here we saw important elements of excitement. For example, the Stephen Curry shoes from Under Armour and the Kyrie Irving shoes from Nike, both posted big gains.","Meanwhile Kobe sales hung in pretty well in the quarter, likely influenced by the buzz around his retirement. The primary losses came in LeBron and KD products, a challenge which we\u2019ve been addressing with our partners at Nike. Between Nike resetting the price value relationship of many of its shoes and focusing their incredible innovation engine, along with the strength of Under Armour and potential momentum at adidas, we\u2019re confident that by the back half of the year there will be in place all the elements of a more robust, diverse signature basketball business.","In the meantime, our leadership positions in footwear categories other than signature basketball enabled us to successfully pivot much of our inventory position into these areas in Q1. Lifestyle running footwear was an especially good business in the quarter with the Roshe and Huarache styles from Nike and ZX Flux from Adi, continuing to be popular sellers.","Category heat and newness was driven by the Nomad and Boost products from Adidas. The Stan Smith Shoe from adidas is another perfect example of a leadership position we have in area other than basketball, in this case Classic Court shoes. This leading position can be seen in the depth of our buys and in the variety of different model executions we sell, quite a few of which are exclusive.","We enjoy a significant number of special makeup styles not just in Stan Smith\u2019s, but also in Superstars, PUMA Suede and various other casual yet premium products. In retrospect, demand for this special product outstrip supply, giving us confidence and the emphasis of our merchandised position over the next several months.","The very strong adi original\u2019s business is also an excellent example of the advantage of our global footprint. Since the trend started in Europe where our merchants recognize the excitement early and share their initial success with our U.S teams before it exploded into a worldwide phenomenon.","Even with the partial shift out of signature basketball, our customers still expect to find and are finding premium sneakers in our stores and on our digital sites, sneakers for which they are willing to pay premium prices. This led to higher footwear units and average selling prices in the quarter with both up low single-digits.","On the apparel side, ASPs were up even more, in the mid single-digit range driven primarily by lower markdowns. Although apparel units were down low single digits, for the most part I describe our men's apparel business as improving, especially in Europe.","Overall, profitability is up both in dollars and rate which as I said last quarter, is a great place to start. We are still working on driving more apparel volume in each of our banners and the investment in our store remodel programs continues to be an important element of our strategy to elevate the storytelling around the premium special products, our vendors are beginning to deliver.","On the women's side, apparel comps were down, as the Lady Foot Locker and especially the SIX:02 customer has almost completely shifted off athletic performance silhouettes into athletic lifestyle. Adi, Nike, and Puma, all have some exciting celebrity driven assortments, but the quantities weren\u2019t enough to offset the decline in the sales of performance products from a year-ago. Meanwhile the overall women's business is being driven by footwear, were the Superstars, Stan Smith and Nike Casual Running trends are even stronger for her, than they\u2019re for the men.","Another clear indication of the ongoing strength of the sneaker trend is that traffic was positive in the quarter, up low single digits both in the U.S and overall. Fortunately, kids still love to touch, feel, and try on sneakers and they love to compare and shop together for the latest and greatest athletic footwear and apparel.","Two exceptions to the good traffic trends though were Runners Point and Sidestep, in Germany, where traffic was down double-digits. Even for the Foot Locker banner in Europe, Germany was the most difficult of the large countries and German retail in general has been a bit tough lately. That said, we\u2019ve plenty of opportunity to improve the performance in Runners Point and Sidestep and it starts with driving more traffic through a combination of more elevated in-store experience, targeted marketing, and most importantly improved and better diversified product assortments.","We've done a lot of work to better define the core customers of these two banners. And the results have helped us in the discussions with our vendors to create the sort of special focused assortments that really motivate these customers. At this point, there hasn\u2019t been enough product depth to stem the comp declines, but our inventory position remain sufficiently clean to enable us, we believe to get these banners back on track as the year progresses.","Turning to our digital business, the growth in our store banners.com continues to be strong, although not at the same pace as a year-ago. We continue to invest in the technological infrastructure behind our digital sites and enrich the content on the customer facing side. Perhaps most importantly, we\u2019re rethinking our approach to our channels.","As Pawan Verma, our Chief Information Officer recently described the concept of the channel doesn't really exist for our customers, only the relationships they have with our brands. Thus, our capital spending is now more consistently based on strengthening that relationship across all of our sales channels. A good example of the return on that investment can be seen in our expanding BOSS sales, buy online, ship from store. Already available across our domestic banners, we rolled it out in the U.K. in the first quarter and plan to expand it on to the European continent in future quarters.","The softest part of our digital business right now is Eastbay, which as Lauren described is really focused on the serious high school athlete. The shift to casual and lifestyle of silhouettes and a slightly declining rate of youth participation in certain sports such as football have hindered Eastbay\u2019s top line recently. While Eastbay\u2019s merchants are shifting a portion of their assortments more in the direction of lifestyle, we intend to keep true to the performance heritage and identity of the Eastbay banner.","We are working to enhance our current customer\u2019s digital experience, and increase brand awareness at younger ages. The goal is to expand the pipeline of kids who know and love the Eastbay brand as they pursue their passion for sports. Examples of success already include the growth in our training in girl\u2019s volleyball businesses.","Before I turn the call over for your questions, I just want to reiterate how proud I\u2019m with the record-setting performance of our team this quarter. We challenge ourselves everyday to be a high-performing organization. Sometimes circumstances don\u2019t allow us to clear the bar by as much as we\u2019d like to. But with the long-term trends towards casualization and active lifestyles firmly intact, the athletic footwear and apparel industry has an exciting space to be in.","We\u2019ve got a great team of associates and a great line-up of vendor partners, and together we\u2019ve many tremendous opportunities to grow and improve Foot Locker\u2019s business as we work to achieve the long-term goals we outlined last year.","Carlos, let\u2019s please open-up the call for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Michael Binetti from UBS is on the line with a question.","Michael Binetti","Hey, good morning guys. I was wondering if I could get a little help understanding the path to mid single-digit same-store sales in the second quarter, just to help us out with our model. I know Lauren, thanks for the detail on the current quarter trends and the launches coming up. But is it -- could you help us think a little bit about the composition of the launches to the quarter and the inventory you have on hand, it sounds like some of the signature basketball areas have been struggling. Is that inventory changing over as near-term as it would -- it seem like it would need to be get you to them at single-digit confidently in the first -- in the second quarter?","Richard Johnson","You know Michael thanks for the question. We\u2019ve got -- we are on wrong side of the launch as Lauren called out with the big Jordan launch that happened last year -- last weekend coming up Memorial Day weekend this year. Normally we wouldn't talk about that so much except three weeks into the quarter, it certainly has a -- makes a difference on the trend. Our team\u2019s done a real good job of shifting the inventory into some of the casual businesses that we talked about in our prepared remarks and the launch cadence for the rest of the quarter lines up really favorably for us. So, certainly the mid single-digits that Lauren talked about and I talked about in our comments are attainable in the quarter Michael.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then, can you just talk about some of the -- on the other businesses that you gave us an update on that were, I guess, some of the potential for the margin opportunity as we look through the year in women's and apparel. And I guess, maybe some updated thoughts on Runners Point as far as how much those can contribute to what we would back into as a margin improvement to get to the double-digit earnings growth this year, any kind of trends you\u2019re seeing there that would be helpful to that story. Thanks.","Richard Johnson","I think we [talked] [ph] to the women's business a bit, the apparel business there is shifting and that it\u2019s still very much an active lifestyle, athletically inspired lifestyle apparel. She is a very discerning shopper. She expects the performance characteristics to be built in, but she's also looking forward to be very fashionable. We\u2019ve seen success with some of the Rihanna product that's launched, that asset driven model with great-looking product that she can use in the gym or in her active lifestyle is really helping drive that business and we\u2019re shifting - we\u2019re up against big performance silhouettes from last year, bigger numbers so as she changes and our inventory changes with her, that will certainly be a contributor. ","Apparel in general as I said is getting better. The Europe team is leading that effort. Their apparel business was up nicely, apparels getting better at Champs and the Kids Foot Locker and solidifying its position at Foot Locker. So we\u2019ve got certainly some upside on the apparel front. The categories that we mentioned, some of the classic sneakers, some of the Lifestyle Running shoes, again our inventory is shifting appropriately, so we see great opportunity there. Our inventory is clean and fresh, so we will be able to manage our markdowns through the quarters and so that really is what\u2019s going to improve sales and the margin opportunity, Michael. As far as Runners Point, we\u2019ve got a traffic issue there. Retail in Germany has been a little bit tough for all of our banners including -- actually all of the segment, but I think as I talked about we've done the deep dive on our customers in the Runners Point and Sidestep doors. We continue to shift the inventory there. Get the inventory properly positioned and it goes back to firing customers when we took out the vulcanized product in the boots and relaunching, if you will, a running only shop on a high street with runners point making sure that we get all of the inventory right. So, the effort in the short-term is to drive traffic. Once they get in the store, we\u2019re able to convert them, because we\u2019ve got a great sales force and a great team on the store floor there. But again, we\u2019ve got to get some traffic in the doors.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot guys.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Camilo Lyon","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to get a little more into the commentary about the improvement or the expected improvement in the back half of signature product. Could you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing from the product that gives you that comfort that there will be a resurgence in demand as opposed to just more of a continuation of the shift out of that particular style of basketball product?","Richard Johnson","Sure. I think there is going to be a bit of a reset on the price value equation with a couple of the big players. The new KD shoe is out in a couple of weeks, so we will get a first -- a first pass at that. The Curry shoe, they continue to be strong and we\u2019ve got the Olympics which drives innovation across a lot of things that we will see in the back half come to a commercial -- to be commercialized in the back half. So, I think the consumer as we\u2019ve shown in specific shoes, the consumer in Canada certainly didn\u2019t have any issues around signature basketballs that led into the All-Star game. So when there is excitement around the product, when there is innovation around the product and when the price value relationship is right for the kid, the category is fine and we expect that in the back half with some of the things we\u2019ve seen coming down the product pipeline. So, again the kid is very discerning and signature basketball is one of his choices. But the strength that we\u2019ve added to our portfolio across the casual sneakers, the boost product from adidas, there is tremendous opportunity in all of our categories and that's why the work we\u2019ve done over the last few years to really build this portfolio of businesses, allows us to absorb a little bit of a body blow on the signature basketball side and still drive a successful winning business.","Camilo Lyon","That\u2019s great. I guess, the follow-up to that is, your comment on more price value, is that -- are we to infer that that refers to lower ASPs? And if that is the case, how do you combat that downward pressure on ASPs to continue to drive overall ASP growth?","Richard Johnson","Well, we just did it in the first quarter. We took a basketball category that was down mid single-digits driven by a drop in signature basketball and our ASPs and units were both up. So, ASPs are a very complex model across our portfolio banners, categories, genders etcetera. So we work very confident that we will be able to continue to drive ASP growth even with a slight modification of pricing in signature basketball.","Camilo Lyon","Great. And then, just a final question, just more of a longer-term question in how you view Nike stepped-up focus on their own dot-com business and how that impacts your business over the long-term. If you could you just articulate how that relationship is unfolding and those discussions are being -- kind of are unfolding with from your perspective, with them.","Richard Johnson","Well, I think we all win when there is an integrated marketplace, they continue to invest in our businesses, they continue to provide great product in our stores. Their product engine continues to remain strong and the relationship continues to remain strong. We know that they\u2019re going to sell DTC both digitally and through some stores. At the same time, we\u2019re working hard with them to make sure that the consumer has all sorts of choices to shop for their product. Our storytelling inside our stores is representative of how we want to represent their brand and how they like to see their brand represented. So as they grow their DTC, their brand grows in totality in the marketplaces and frankly we see it as a positive, the more integrated the marketplace is, the stronger we\u2019re, the stronger the brands are that we sell.","Lauren Peters","We look at their long-term goals and our long-term goals and they\u2019re not inconsistent. They both support one another.","Richard Johnson","Exactly.","Camilo Lyon","Got it. Good luck, guys. All the best. Thank you.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Camilo.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Svezia with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Christopher Svezia","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I was just wondering, maybe you can clarify just for May what impact the New York store closings are having? And, I guess, more explicitly, are you trending something like down low single digits so far in May and are you expecting it to be up low single digits when everything is set and done, once you get the Jordan, I think the Retro 12 into the comp number for May?","Richard Johnson","We won\u2019t dig into the specifics of the two stores in Midtown Manhattan. Obviously, that\u2019s pretty proprietary information Chris, but they certainly are having an impact and we are looking forward to the opening of two significant flagships here in Midtown Manhattan and we will manage the business through their closures obviously. As Lauren called out in her comments, we are running down for the month as we expected. But we will shift to being comp positive certainly as we get through the soup launch over Memorial Day. So, the nuances of low mid singles, mid-mid singles -- up mid singles, that\u2019s you will have to make your model work. We can\u2019t give you a lot more details on that Chris.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. And Lauren, for you, just more specifically, as you think about gross margin and SG&A as we go through the year, just any nuances between them as we think about the quarterlies? And I think gross margin you set up 10 to 30 on the year, any thoughts about the SG&A leverage as we think about the year?","Lauren Peters","Yes, again we still think that SG&A for full-year intend to 30 basis point range with mid single-digit comps is achievable. And that\u2019s the range. As we called out, first quarter we have the uniqueness of headquarter move and the comp came in at the low single-digit. This quarter with that being relatively lower volume quarter that makes the leverage a bit challenging on SG&A this quarter, but again 10 to 30 for full-year.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. And final question, just as it relates to basketball, is it fair to say that as you go through the second quarter you probably face the -- potentially the easiest comparison as you go through in non-signature basketball, so, LeBron, KD, Nike branded basketball relative to last year? It seemed like last year it declined or started to decline pretty precipitously. Does the comparison start to ease as the product and price value starts to improve as you go through the year? Is that a fair characterization?","Richard Johnson","Yes, I mean, that\u2019s what the industry numbers would tell you, Chris and we\u2019re reflective of that. I mean, the signatures, again I always hate to focus on one small, one segment of our business, but you\u2019re right. The comparisons get a bit easier as we go through the middle part of the year and we will see some of the changes that we talked about positively impacting the signature product during that time period, so yes.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. Thank you. All the best to you. Thanks.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So, double-digit earnings on mid single-digit same-store sales reiterated for the year. Dick, I guess my question, is double-digit earnings possible at a low single-digit comp, if that were the backdrop multiyear. Just any color on P&L flexibility would be helpful?","Richard Johnson","Yes, our team does a really good job of managing expenses and I think the leverage that we get obviously changes with low single-digit, but over time I don\u2019t think there's a limiter. Certainly we\u2019ve to gain, but I\u2019d defer a little bit to Lauren.","Lauren Peters","Again on a occupancy side of it, we need lower end of mid single. We\u2019ve been investing in some significant properties and with that comes some higher rent. But over the long-term that -- those drive some really significant volumes, which lets you get that leverage again. But for our near-term, low end of mid singles is where we get the lever.","Matthew Boss","Okay. And then, if we just -- if we built your full-year mid single-digit comp bottoms up, it sounds like the best way to think about it is basketball improves from the first quarter trend. But just what\u2019s the best way to think about basketball versus running versus what we saw in the first quarter? And then, Lauren, just any help on the quarterly cadence of total Company comps in 2Q versus the back half, I think would really help for our models.","Richard Johnson","Yes, as I just said, I think basketball Q1 was probably the toughest comparer for the year and gets marginally better as we go through the middle part and back half. So, again the money has shifted, our category managers have done a good job of moving money into casual product and the lifestyle running. So, they manage an entire portfolio and they\u2019re able to move out of basketball, what they should move out of basketball and into our categories. So, again I think basketball does improve from Q1 going forward. There is a lot of excitement that it\u2019s going to come in the back half of the year. So, that the cadence of comps, we haven\u2019t really gotten into specific quarters, but \u2026","Lauren Peters","But, I want to make sure, I understand the question and are you asking for us to further define mid by quarter?","Matthew Boss","So, would 2Q be a -- is 2Q a low single-digit comp and the back half is high single or is it mid single-digit comps all three quarters of the year?","Lauren Peters","Oh, okay. So, yes I will reiterate what we said, mid single-digit by quarter, including this quarter.","Matthew Boss","Okay, great. Best of luck.","Lauren Peters","Thank you.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Tom Nikic, Wells Fargo has the next question. Please go ahead.","Tom Nikic","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Richard Johnson","Hi, Tom.","Tom Nikic","So not to harp on Q2 too much, but -- so you gave a little detail about being negative thus far, but there is the timing shifts that helped May. Is there anything we should think about from the launch calendar perspective in June and July that would really sort of help the business get back on the mid single-digit trend and, I guess, maybe into August as we think about the call three months from today?","Richard Johnson","Well, as I said Tom, once we get to the launch on Memorial Day, we like the launch cadence for the rest of the quarter and we align up well, they\u2019re not always date for day matches, but across the rest of the quarter we like the launch position that we\u2019ve got and again launch is only one part of the business. So, I hate to fixate too much on it, but we look -- the only reason we really bring it up is that three weeks into a quarter, a significant launch looks different than it does 13 weeks into the quarter. So, we\u2019re -- I\u2019m comfortable with where the launch calendar is and our launch sequencing for the remainder of the second quarter and as we get into back-to-school season.","Tom Nikic","Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up. So, obviously basketball has been weighing on the business, but you\u2019ve done a lot of work over the last couple of years to diversify the assortment, and not being a, quote-unquote, one-legged stool. Is there any color you can provide as far as the size of basketball relative to your total footwear business? And if basketball should sort of remain weakish, do you feel like you\u2019ve levers to pull in running and casual to keep hitting the mid single-digit guide for the year? Thanks.","Richard Johnson","We won\u2019t breakout the percentage of basketball to the total, but yes we believe we\u2019ve levers to pull in casual, in running, lifestyle etcetera, so \u2026","Lauren Peters","And I\u2019m going to reiterate, we did that in Q1, mid single-digit footwear comps.","Tom Nikic","All right. Great. Thanks very much. And best of luck for the rest of the year.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jay Sole, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jay Sole","Hi, good morning.","Richard Johnson","Hi, Jay.","Jay Sole","You -- hi, you mentioned rapidly shifting product category preferences. Can you talk about of these shifts which do you see as kind of permanent and which kind of are more temporary?","Richard Johnson","With our core consumer, Jay, I wouldn\u2019t call any of them permanent. I mean, our consumer\u2019s going to buy the coolest shoe they can find, they\u2019re going to buy the shoe that sends the message that they want to send. So again, to think that there is a permanent shift from one category to another category, we certainly don\u2019t look at the business like that. Our team is constantly evaluating where we believe the consumer will be, we\u2019re working with our vendor partners to create great product and there is just is nothing in our business, that\u2019s permanent. So, I think you need to understand the flexibility that our consumer has and they\u2019re ultimately in control of a product decision.","Lauren Peters","Right. I would say what is enduring is that they\u2019re well above sneaker.","Richard Johnson","Yes, absolutely.","Lauren Peters","We certainly saw it in the traffic and their appetite for some really great looking styles across the categories.","Jay Sole","Maybe if I can follow-up with this, to the NBA playoffs matter, you mentioned LeBron James and Kevin Durant are some signature shoes that haven\u2019t done as well. Those players are still in the playoffs playing at the top of their game. If those players continue to be successful, maybe win the NBA championship, does that matter?","Richard Johnson","What matters is that there is excitement around things that drive sneakers, right. Whether Kyrie and LeBron win or Steph Curry wins, certainly that the more positive news about that or Russell Westbrook and KD in Oklahoma City. I don\u2019t know that there is a direct correlation to them winning the championship and us selling more sneakers other than it creates great momentum and great energy around whatever the sneaker is that that\u2019s selling next. So, it matters just like the Olympics matter and that there is excitement around sport, athletics. People\u2019s consciousness around sport goes up. They attach that sometimes with sneakers and we win. But we root for them all equally, Jay, just to be clear.","Jay Sole","Understood. And then, maybe one last one, just in terms of the shifts that consumers are undergoing, you didn\u2019t mention maybe channel shifts. I mean, you talked about it within your business, but there has been a lot of talk in retail about the shift toward kind of big online pure-play competitors. Is that something that\u2019s kind of impacting your business in any way? Can you just talk about that aspect of it?","Richard Johnson","I don\u2019t necessarily think that the big pure-play so much, that the product that we\u2019ve is unique. The consumer as they displayed in Q1 loves to come into our stores. They like to feel the shoes, see the shoes, talk about the shoes with our associates. And we want to be able to service the customer regardless of where they want to shop today or where they want to engage with us. I think Pawan did a great job with an op ed piece for Shoptalk that really talked about channels not existing, only the relationship. And we\u2019re trying to deepen that relationship with our consumer across all of the channels, so that the first thing to think about when they think about sneakers is Foot Locker.","Lauren Peters","They interact with our brand across all the channels, all the opportunities to access our brand. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on is giving them a great, consistent experience across all of those channels.","Jay Sole","Okay, got it. Thank you so much.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Christof Fischer","Hey, good morning. This is Christof Fischer on for Erinn. So, I was wondering with the closing of a number of sports retailers in the U.S., what type of opportunity does this give you this year, or maybe longer term to pursue some market share? And is there any benefit that you could reap from any channel inventory that's being sold at off-price? Thanks.","Richard Johnson","Well, the direct impact is probably less apparent to us than it is to some of the other sporting goods big box guys with the people that are closing down, they will likely see some benefits once they get through some of this sale product and some of the liquidation that\u2019s going on. I think there is great opportunity for our Eastbay brand as these destinations for team sports products and cleated product and baseball bats and gloves etcetera, dry up a little bit in the marketplace that plays right into our direct connection with that consumer through Eastbay. Most of the product that\u2019s being liquidated would not mirror a product that\u2019s in our store. It\u2019s in a different distribution level. It\u2019s a different segmentation level for most of our vendors. So, while we will see some pickup undoubtedly of people that are looking for sneakers, I think there is probably more of an impact other places in the broader sporting goods industry.","Christof Fischer","Okay, great. Thanks. And then as a quick follow-up, with the new overtime ruling, does this impact you guys? And is this something that you guys have talked about internally yet?","Richard Johnson","Sure. We talked about it since the draft rule started to be circulated and I think it will impact everybody that runs a business. So, we\u2019ve to make some decisions. We\u2019ve to look at our work force in depth and figure out what the right way to handle these new rules are. So, we will manage this change in rules just the way we manage them all and we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s focused on it, working on it. The -- yes, the only surprise is that it's going to happen a little bit sooner than we may have expected, but our team will react to that -- respond accordingly.","Christof Fischer","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Richard Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robbie Ohmes","Oh, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Dick, actually it\u2019s going to be three questions. The first, obviously you guys keep calling out the Steph Curry shoe, is there any other initiatives with Under Armour maybe on the apparel side, even as you head into back-to-school in fall? Is there anything you can do to build on that momentum or is it still just isolated to it being a signature shoe phenomenon? And second question would be Olympics, anything launching with Nike or anything that could drive some momentum in the back-to-school? And the third is just multiple pair purchases. Can you give us an update on trending of multiple pair purchases? Is that still on the rise as part of this shift towards non-technical? And I will repeat them if you forgot some of them, but thanks.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Robbie. Just -- certainly we\u2019ve got strong Steph Curry business as we called out and I\u2019m excited to relive the fact that we\u2019ve opened our second UA Armory at Champs Sports down in the Galleria, in Dallas. So as we continue to develop our relationships with Under Armour, obviously we want to be better in the apparel business with them, they want to be better in the apparel business in the mall. So we continue to work at that. There are constant initiatives that we\u2019re working on both on the footwear side and the apparel side with them. So, we\u2019ve a great deal of optimism around the brand and the brand is more than Steph Curry. That gets all of the highlights and all of the press right now, but they\u2019re certainly more depth to it than that. On the Olympics front, there certainly is some technology that we will see in the Olympics that will be commercialized later in the year. Those launches that coincide with that from the athletes and the players. There is benefit across all sorts of categories from our track and field business up at Eastbay to signature basketball that will have some Olympics silhouettes that certainly get launched through to some apparel technologies that we will see from a lot of the brands that come out. And I\u2019m going to turn to Lauren on the multi pair question. She is able to take a quick look.","Lauren Peters","Yes, the dynamic really remains, but average ticket is going up and we had more transaction averaging as retails going up, but units per transaction, not an increase.","Robbie Ohmes","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.","Richard Johnson","Okay, Robbie. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Kate McShane","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Richard Johnson","Good morning.","Kate McShane","With regards to the women\u2019s business, I think you sounded a little bit more positive on footwear versus apparel. Is that due to just the mix of product? And when do you expect apparel to improve or inflect for women?","Richard Johnson","Yes, certainly at this moment Kate, it\u2019s certainly across Q1, it was -- our women\u2019s business was led by footwear certainly. We part of the excitement around our two new flagship stores in Midtown is that each of those will have a SIX:02 space and it\u2019s we will really get a chance to test and push some limits on the apparel front and as we move from pure performance silhouettes into more active lifestyle silhouette, I see the apparel position and those silhouettes improving as we get later in Q2 and into the back half. But probably the most exciting thing in our women\u2019s business is the two new flagships that will be close to us. We will be able to really take some leadership positions in some key apparel opportunities.","Kate McShane","Okay. And then my second question is the ticket and traffic trends that you cited sound very encouraging. I wondered if you could give any more detail on how much ticket pressure there was from basketball and if it was offset by other categories, or if the pressure maybe wasn\u2019t as big necessarily in basketball as some people feared?","Richard Johnson","Well, it\u2019s probably not a ticket question as much as it is an ASP question Kate on basketball. And clearly we drove a lift in ASP, so there is a mix that happened with premium signature basketball down mid single-digits able to be offset from an ASP point of view and the other categories. So \u2026","John Maurer","Including these Jordan Horizon\u2019s, they were not cheap, these are premium shoes that are at the same relative price point as signature basketball shoe.","Richard Johnson","So, that there -- I can\u2019t compliment our team enough in a way that they\u2019re able to manage a very complex ASP and add on sale sort of environment. So again, I think the question is more around ASP than multi unit sales on a ticket.","Kate McShane","Okay, great. Thank you.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Kate.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Krasik","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. A couple, so first a comment around the revolver, Lauren. Are you suggesting that you will actually be dipping into it and we should plan for that over the course of the year relative to last year? And then, just all the moving parts collectively, how much was your international comp up all together? And then just lastly, Dick, thoughts around allocations for the launch product, is it getting to be too much, would you rather have more of a scarcity factor, sellouts to drive demand? Thanks.","Lauren Peters","So, on the credit facility, no, no intention to dip into it. The former facility was in place through the beginning of next year, but we saw the opportunity to get into the new facility a little bit earlier and with that we took the opportunity to expand the amount. It just gives us flexibility and the time was right to do it.","Richard Johnson","Our international comps were up mid single-digits in the quarter, Scott. And then in terms of the allocations, we absolutely believe in the asset led scarcity model. So the brands do a good job I believe in controlling the quantities that enter the marketplace and we work with them to get the right quantities. So, there is a lot of excitement around sneakers and some of the heritage sneakers, some of the OG colorways etcetera really drive heat in the marketplace and its an important piece of the business, but again I -- we work close with our vendors to make sure that the scarcity model continues to contribute to our success.","Scott Krasik","And then just the Memorial Day launch calendar, is the Curry playoff shoe, is that as meaningful as the Jordan or is that as meaningful relative to other launches? Thanks.","Richard Johnson","Well all the launches have some meaning, Scott. I think when you get a shoe like the flu game shoe that launches, that\u2019s -- it doesn\u2019t happen often. It is special. I don\u2019t think Lauren is going to buy a pair, but it is special. Just the Curry launch is special, I mean the MVP, the championship whatever units they launch across the year. So I\u2019m not going to really compare the relative strength. That\u2019s for the consumer to ultimately decide. But both of those launches are important to us.","Scott Krasik","Okay. Thanks. Good luck.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Sam Poser from Sterne Agee CRT. Please go ahead.","Sam Poser","Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I just got a couple. Number one, is this really -- is this a basketball problem with the signature basketball or is this just a specific item problem where those shoes that happen to be signature basketball shoes aren\u2019t as sought after as they were some time ago, while the Roshe and the tubular and various other things are just more sought after than they were a year-ago?","Richard Johnson","Well, I think as I said in my comments, Sam, we saw a great up take in the Kyrie Irving shoe and the Steph Curry shoe big significant signature product. The challenge that we faced was really around the two athletes, LeBron and KD were the kid just didn\u2019t see the price value relationship in those offerings in the quarter that they\u2019ve seen in the past. So, I think the kid is multifaceted. Our core consumer changes their preferences sometimes multiple times during a day. So, I think that they certainly are after things like the Roshe and the Boost product and the Huarache, the Presto from Nike and all sorts of great products. So, it\u2019s a price value relationship around a couple of key athlete shoes that I think is being addressed appropriately going forward.","Sam Poser","Okay. Thank you. And then, secondly, I mean, given the progress or what progress you are making, with SIX:02 and I guess, I\u2019m going to ask the same thing about the Runners Point and Sidestep businesses, do you foresee that you are going to be rolling those out next year? How do you foresee the store opening plans for both as we look ahead based on the progress you are making right now?","Richard Johnson","Well as we talked about Sam, SIX:02 we took a little bit of a slower track this year just because we got these two big flagship stores that will be very important to the SIX:02 brand, as well as it is relaunching and updating the six:02.com site, which is really important when you only have 30 doors, it is important that your dot-com or your digital site really represents that brand well. So, that that\u2019s what 2016 is about and we expect to continue to accelerate the rollout as we get into 2017 with SIX:02. Runners Point and Sidestep, we detailed a little bit about where the challenges are. The rollout there will probably take a little bit slower track until we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve got the assortment right and that running store specifically around Runners Point are the right formula on the high street in Western Europe. So, we opened in Vienna last year, so as we take Runners Point slowly out of Germany, we will measure the results there. Sites that we\u2019ve got some work going on in terms of store format, we just have to get those things right. We take a pretty pragmatic approach to build a prototype, see the results of the prototype, test it, tweak it, evaluate it again before we go into a full-blown rollout. That hasn't changed nor will change as we go forward. We invest -- we are going to spend $297 million this year. We want to be confident that we\u2019re going to get the right ROIC on those investments.","Sam Poser","Thank you very much. Good luck.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Sam.","Lauren Peters","Thanks, Sam.","John Maurer","Carlos, I think we\u2019ve got time for just one more question.","Operator","All right, sir. Our last question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Richard Johnson","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Trussell","Hey, Dick. So you all have certainly emphasized the diversification of the mix today, with the footwear business still being up mid single digits despite basketball being down. But perhaps you can just give us a little bit of color on overall demand, if your outlook has changed at all on the sneaker business, just given that trend line did decelerate a bit from what you produced last year, and whether there were any other factors in the quarter that you think impacted those results, or was it just specifically the deceleration in signature basketball?","Richard Johnson","I will take the question, Paul. I think you might have directed it to Lauren, but we\u2019re as optimistic, if not more optimistic about the sneaker culture, the casualization of the world than we\u2019ve ever been. Again, we managed through if we would have been on this call 18 months ago, and had a business where signature basketball was down or basketball was down mid single-digit, we would not have had positive results. Our business wasn\u2019t strong on the other legs as strong on the other legs of the stool, but the team has strengthened across all of those legs and able to drive a comp gain in a very difficult retail environment with the bears out there saying that we\u2019re simply a basketball brand and we can\u2019t survive if basketball struggles. I think we\u2019ve proved that wrong in this quarter.","Lauren Peters","Maybe that\u2019s testimony to how close our organization is to their customer to understand their product preferences and make sure that we\u2019re really bringing them the cool stuff. And I\u2019d point to the fact that we had traffic growth in the quarter as indicating how strong that customer is feeling about the category.","Paul Trussell","And then just lastly, I think that it would be helpful if you can give some context on how you think the basketball category trend line may be as we exit 2016 and maybe get through some of these near-term hurdles. And then on the other side, from a category standpoint, do you get similar exclusives from Nike on the running and casual side as you do in basketball? And then is adidas and Under Armour putting out enough inventory in the marketplace to keep up with demand on their new launches?","Richard Johnson","There is a whole bunch of questions in one there, Paul. So, we think that the basketball trend line improves, but we also think that the customer is very flexible in their foot covering choices, their sneaker choices these days. So, wherever there is a cool sneaker, they\u2019re going to find it at Foot Locker and they\u2019re going to choose the category. They don\u2019t -- it\u2019s little bit like them not thinking about channels, they don\u2019t really think about categories that much. They think about coolness. And if the sneakers got the cool factor for whatever they want to do, that\u2019s the sneaker that they will buy. So, again, we see strength, we\u2019ve certain level of exclusives across all categories, but the -- one of the real advantages we\u2019ve got and we called it out in our prepared remarks is that we see things happening all around the globe. So, our European business maybe on something quicker than our U.S business or quicker than our vendor partners bring it to the U.S marketplace. Its one of the things that happened with this great turn that we\u2019ve seen with adidas. Our European team called it out, our U.S team was able to get on some of the sneakers sooner than we probably would have had we not had that European business. So, again the strength of the portfolio goes cross categories, it goes across geographies, it goes across contact points with the consumer. And I guess, your last question on is there enough of the hot product in the marketplace? There is never enough of the hot product in the marketplace and that\u2019s what the scarcity model is all about. So, we see -- I mean, you all saw the adidas results, you see the Under Armour results, that they\u2019re having success, but we want some more of their key products, absolutely. But again the scarcity model is what fuels our sneaker industry. So, again, my hats off to all of our suppliers as they\u2019ve manage the marketplaces that we do business in.","Paul Trussell","Thanks and good luck.","Richard Johnson","All right. Thanks, Paul.","Lauren Peters","Thanks, Paul.","John Maurer","Thanks, everybody for your great questions today. If we didn\u2019t get your question or you have a follow-up, I will be back in my desk in a few minutes. Meanwhile, thanks again for your participation. Please join us on our next call which we anticipate will take place at 9 on Friday August 19, following the release of our second quarter results earlier that morning.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views for future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on many assumptions and factors, including the effects of currency fluctuations, customer preferences, economic and market conditions worldwide and other risks and uncertainties described in the company's press release and SEC filings.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John Maurer","Thank you, Chris [ph], and welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As reported earlier this morning, Foot Locker, Inc. sustained its operating momentum in the third quarter by posting an 8.7% comparable sale gain. Non-GAAP net income was $141 million, equating to earnings of an even one dollar per share, a 20% increase over the $0.83 per share the company earned in the same quarter last year.","Included in our GAAP results this quarter was a $100 million pre-tax charge related to pension plan litigation. Including this expense, which was $61 million after-tax, or $0.43 per share, our GAAP EPS was $0.57 in the third quarter. In September, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in this case, which was initiated in 2007. The case relates to the communications to plan participants 20 years ago around changes to the benefits under Woolworths pension plan in 1996.","As noted in our press release of September 30, the company disagrees with the court's decision and has filed a notice of appeal. Lauren will provide some context to the case a bit later, but because this litigation is pending, we will not be able to provide any additional information about the case in response to questions after our prepared remarks.","A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the press release issued earlier today. For the first nine months of the year, the company has generated record net income of $440 million - $444 million or $3.14 per share on a non-GAAP basis. This EPS figure is 22% higher than the $2.58 per share earned in the first three quarters of 2014.","Lauren Peters, Foot Locker's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dick Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are with me here this morning and will now provide the details of our operating performance during the third quarter.","Lauren?","Lauren Peters","Thank you, John, and let me thank all of you for joining us on our call this morning in New York. We are very pleased to be reporting such strong sales and earnings for our third quarter. As we continue to build on our successful model of delivering to our customers the most innovative athletically-inspired footwear and apparel in the market. Our success has been remarkably consistent across multiple geographies, banners, families of business, and product categories. We drove strong top and bottom line performance in both our stores and digital segments. Demonstrating once again the importance of connecting with, and serving our customers however they choose to shop.","As mentioned during our previous call in August, the back-to-school season shifted later this year. Our comps were running at mid-single digits at the time of our call, which is where August landed in total. As many kids held back shopping until later in the season, our September sales accelerated nicely to low double-digits and are momentum carried over into October which increased just shy of double-digits. We've continued to drive solid comparable sales gains since then with our November and month-to-date cop gains towards the high end of mid-single digits.","Let's start our review of the third quarter with our store segment which in total posted an 8% comparable sales increase. The gains were led by Foot Locker Europe which generated an outstanding increase in the high teens. Foot Locker Europe generated double-digit gains in almost all countries and in all major categories, including men's, women's, and kids, footwear, apparel, and accessories, and in running, basketball, and classic styles. Runners [indiscernible] and sidestep, however, did not participate in the strength experience by Foot Locker in Europe with comp sales declining low double digits. Dick will provide more color on the dynamics behind this result during his comments.","The rest of our international business was strong with a high single digit come again in Canada and yet an even stronger result in Asia-Pacific where comp sales increased low teens. Our domestic stores executed very well too, with Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker both up high single digit. Champs sports and Lady Foot Locker 602 were both up low single digits. While Footaction ended the quarter with a slight comp decline. Footaction actually posted a mid-single-digit overall sales increase, but its comp and traffic were negatively impacted by some big stores that were temporarily closed for remodeling.","Footaction as of the same early stage of remodeling its store fleets that the Foot Locker and Champs sports banners were a couple of years ago but not enough remodeled scores experiencing a sales lift to compensate for several weeks that certain key stores start remodeling. Those Footaction stores that have been remodeled are, in fact, doing quite well. Our direct to customer segment posted another fine performance in the third quarter with an overall comparable sales gain of 13.4%, Eastbay was up mid-single digits while our domestic store banner.com businesses collectively increased almost 30%. Our international direct businesses, which are much smaller than the U.S., were also up close to 30% with strong gains in Foot Locker Europe and Canada partially offset by weakness in runners client. Direct to customer sales increased to 12.4% of total sales, up from 12.1% a year ago.","Overall, footwear continued to be our strongest category posting another low double-digit sales increase, while apparel maintained its pace of the mid-single-digit sales increase, partially offset by certain accessory categories which continued to face difficult comps. Within footwear, running was the strongest category with a mid-teens gain, while basketball was up mid-single digits. The other leg of my footwear stool, including boots and classics, was also very strong. Dick will provide more details about all of these categories in a few minutes. Comparable sales of men's and women's footwear were both up high single digits and kids footwear sales increased in the teens.","Similar to the prior quarters of 2015, reported sales were reduced by about $90 million in Q3 due to the impact of weaker FX rates this year compared to rates in effect a year ago. Thus our 8.9% total sales gain translated into a reported sales increase of 3.6%. Our strong third quarter sales results were joined by a strong gross margin performance with the rate improving 60 basis points to 33.8% of sales from 33.2% a year ago.","Of note, this quarter was the first in a long time that our initial market rate did not decline as spender and category mix have stabilized. Merchandise margin improved about 70 basis points on a constant currency basis. A bit of the gain related to the final liquidation of CCS inventory in our results last year, although the bigger contributor was an incrementally lower markdown rate. Fixed cost leverage also contributed 10 basis points to our improved gross margin rate while FX rates took away 20 basis points.","Effectively leveraging our shared service model for most support functions, we continue to be very disciplined in managing our expenses. Helped by FX, our reported SG&A dollars were again down slightly in the quarter with our expense rate improving 80 basis points to 19.6% of sales from 20.4% last year. Our income tax expense rate landed better than planned on a non-GAAP basis, due primarily to releasing reserve in a jurisdiction where a statute of limitation expired. On a GAAP basis, our tax rate was lowered significantly due to the fact that the litigation charge reduced our U.S. income where our tax rates are highest.","Our inventory continued to be very well positioned at the end of October with a year-over-year increase of just 0.9% compared to our 3.6% reported sales increase. On a constant currency basis, inventory was up 4.5% compared to our 8.9% sales increase. Our inventory is very fresh heading into the holiday season, and we are excited to get going on this year's best ever Week of Greatness that starts tomorrow.","We also maintained our balanced capital allocation strategy during the quarter. First, we invested $57 million of capital into our business, bringing our total year-to-date capital expenditures to $173 million. Second, we paid another $0.25 dividend, totaling $35 million. And finally, we spent just shy of $111 million to repurchase 1.56 million shares of our stock. That brought our year-to-date total share repurchase to $316 million, a reduction in shares outstanding of more than 3%. And we did all of that while still ending the quarter with $878 million of balance sheet cash, down a bit from a year ago.","The story with traffic this quarter was the same as last quarter, with a modest decline in U.S. traffic offsetting strong traffic trends internationally, producing a small overall increase in traffic. As mentioned in Q2, we believe that the different traffic patterns here and abroad relate to the significantly stronger dollar this year, which has led, in particular, to less tourist traffic in the U.S.","Average selling prices continued to increase both in footwear and apparel. Unit sales were also up in footwear but down in apparel as we continue to transition our assortments towards more premium styles. Conversion also ticked up as the investments we are making in exciting store environments, merchandise systems, training programs for associates, and really terrific marketing programs all have combined to increase the chances of our shoppers leaving our stores with a bag or two full of the innovative shoes and apparel that our vendors continue to deliver. So as we head into the holidays, we still see Q4 potentially shaping up as follows: a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain, perhaps at the high end of that range. 30-40 basis points of improvement in both gross margin and SG&A, and a double-digit EPS gain.","Before I hand the call to Dick for a product and strategy review, I want to put in perspective the litigation charge that John mentioned that the beginning of this call. Most importantly, I want to emphasize that we have a very strong balance sheet and a well-funded pension plan. The company's reasonable estimate of the litigation expense is a range between $100 million and $200 million with no amount within that range more probable than any other. In accordance with U.S. GAAP therefore, we recorded a $100 million accrual. We believe our pension plan is sufficiently well-funded today to absorb a liability of $100 million or more, without requiring any cash contributions by the company to the plan in the near term. Thus discharge does not change our ability to invest in the business to reach the 2020 goals we laid out at the beginning of the year, and to return cash to shareholders just as we intended to before this litigation charge.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Lauren. That's a very important point to make as we focus on the future. Good morning, everyone. We really appreciate your interest in our company, which has now generated 23 consecutive quarters of meaningful sales and profit growth. We've talked a lot over the last several years about how we have diversified the business. The strength of our different banners and channels, the global reach of our footprint, strong businesses in men's, women's, and kids, and the multiple legs to our product category store. Basketball, running, and classic sneakers along with apparel.","This quarter, and in fact the entire year to date, represents a perfect illustration of how building that diversity has helped us sustain record-setting growth over multiple quarters and years. True, not every one of our initiatives has performed up to our expectations, and I will touch on those. But we have so many outstanding examples of success that I could easily fill up this entire call talking about them. But I know you'll have plenty of questions, so I'll make sure to leave the usual time for those at the end.","First, Europe. The Foot Locker banner there turned in an exceptional performance with strong double-digit gains in both running, and basketball footwear as well as in classic sneakers. Running was led by lifestyle products such as Huarache and Roshe and Nike, and Max Air from Nike and ZX Flux from Adidas. White Basketball was driven by Jordan. Classic styles were highlighted by superstars in Stan Smiths from Audi and Air Force ones from Nike. Boots, led by Timberland, were also up double-digit.","Apparel in Europe was even stronger than footwear, with both Nike and Audi doing quite well along with our own private label business. As proud as we are of the success Foot Locker is having in Europe right now, we're certainly not satisfied. First, we are still below the peak productivity levels we reached before the great recession. Second, we believe that the systems, remodeling, and associate training initiatives we have put in place globally in the recent years can lift our European results to new record productivity levels in the future. On top of that, our Kids Foot Locker business in Europe is doing very well with growth opportunities both in terms of cap gains and adding productive new Kids Foot Locker stores.","Finally, Foot Locker's online business in Europe is still quite under penetrated, so as we enhance the digital connections with our customers there, we see tremendous opportunity for even better performance. Right now, our runners point and sidestep banners are not participating in the momentum seen at Foot Locker. We're still working through our market segmentation strategy in Germany. The initial tests last year of that strategy, which was to take Runners Point back to its roots of being all things running and positioning Sidestep as a true lifestyle banner, were very encouraging.","However, the athletic market in Germany has set it a bit, reviewing in hindsight an overreliance on a few key styles that are no longer as relevant for those banners' consumers. We still believe in our segmentation strategy, but we have work to do to build enough diversity into that product assortment at both banners to ensure that we can respond to fashion shifts more nimbly than we have so far this year.","Now turning to the U.S., our Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker banners both turned in excellent quarters. Here's a perfect example of how the product diversity that we have developed, really a focus on delivery the coolest premium sneakers to our customers across categories, helps us ensure we can generate strong results despite fashion shifts that in the past may have caused our products to [indiscernible].","Because what led the performance this quarter was running, court classics, and boots. We have developed a leadership position in lifestyle running in the U.S., and in fact, all of our markets, including Max Air, Roshe, and Huarache from Nike, ZX Flux from Adidas. Meanwhile, we continued to build bigger lifestyle programs with Puma, New Balance, Sockany, and ASICS. As in Europe, exciting new executions of classic court shoes such as Air Force Ones, Superstars and Jordans also performed very well in the U.S. Recognizing that our boot business is more about fashion than the weather, we brought in bigger quantities and more styles of Timberland and Nike boots for back-to-school, and the results were terrific.","Finally, let's not forget about the U.S. basketball business because we have an increase there, too. Signature basketball witnessed a shift with gains in [indiscernible] at Nike and Steph Curry at Under Armour, not to mention strong gains in Jordan, creating a solid marquee basketball business overall despite what we believe is a temporary slowdown in sales of the more established player shoes.","Meanwhile, lifestyle basketball styles sold very well and some of the performance business has also shifted into the court classic styles I just mentioned. The end result of all the shifts in footwear in the U.S. we believe is more balanced product portfolio and vendor mix. It helps keep the legs of our product stool steady, positioned for consistent sales growth.","Our kids business continues to perform very well, not just in Kids Foot Locker but in virtually all our banners that sell children's product. The merchandise highlights here were mostly the same as at the Big Brother Foot Locker banner as we capitalized on the same trends. We also continue to open new Kids Foot Locker stores both in the U.S. and overseas as we look to solidify our leadership position in kids in our key geographic markets.","Lauren mentioned a couple of reasons why Footaction's comp was down slightly. What drove Footaction's total sales to actually be up mid-single digits was the opening of several new power stores this year such as the one in Del Amo Fashion Center south of L.A. and of course the new flagship store on State Street in Chicago. This exciting new Footaction store also includes a Nike Kicks lounge and a Flight 23 shop, creating the premier Jordan brand experience.","Lady Foot Locker 602 produced a sixth consecutive comparable sales gain, a solid achievement as we continue our work to develop 602 into our primary women's brand. Just this week, we are opening our 28th and 29th 602 stores, and last week we conducted our second annual It's Your Time 602 6K race in Dallas, a fun event that combined a competitive 6K race with special post-race style events.","Footwear was strong at Lady Foot Locker 602, led by several lifestyle running celebs. The Nike Flyknit performed well as did the PUMA Creeper, a good example of an active lifestyle fashion success story. Apparel, on the other hand, was a bit challenging this quarter. A nice pickup in Adi and Nike lifestyle apparel was not enough to offset declines in some of the more basic branded performance shorts and bras. We're working with our key vendors, all of whom have called out women's athletics apparel as an important focus for them to develop special programs and styles for our athletically active customers in 602.","In the meantime, our women's business and our other banners continued to be strong with sales of women's footwear up low double-digits. We have heightened our focus on the female uses for each banner, a process we went through much earlier with our men's businesses, leading to having more of the right product assortments for her in the different banners in which she chooses to shop.","Turning to our digital business, it remains very robust and is on pace to be our next billion dollar business. Better yet, we have tremendous opportunity to accelerate growth, especially in our international markets where our digital penetration remains low. We have in place our new digital platform in Europe that we're just beginning to take full advantage of and a relatively new website gaining traction in Canada. We have created excellent connections with are core customers online, connections that start well in advance of their developing an intention to buy anything from us.","Whether that is our Foot Locker app with innovative shoe emojis, the lunch calendar feature on Champs sports, links to our outstanding ads on YouTube, or simply the store locator function on all of our sites, our customers are interacting with us 24\/7. Although roughly 80% of transactions start with some sort of digital interaction, 88% are still completed at a store, demonstrating how critical it is to have both great digital content and exciting places to actually go touch, feel, and try on the product and experience our brand. We will continue to invest meaningfully in both digital and bricks and mortar.","Let me stop the business review there, because we want to get to your questions. But before we do, one last thing. One dollar per share of earnings in the quarter was another outstanding effort and performance by everyone on the Foot Locker Inc. team. Yes, it's a tough retail environment out there. We hear that all the time. But in my experience, retail is a challenging game even at the best of times. But by focusing on the customer, creating exciting places to shop and buy, investing in our people and processes, living by our core values, and partnering with the best suppliers in the world, we have a very real chance of continuing to have a lot of happy customers and to win every day.","I want to thank all of our associates here and around the world who once again pulled together to set a new standard of excellence in our financial and operational performance in Q3. I can't wait to see it happen again this quarter. As we head into the holiday season, we want to wish all of you the very best and remember every holiday outfit looks best with a brand-new pair of sneakers.","Chris [ph], please open the call to questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question comes from the line of Mitch Kummetz [ph] with B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. I want to start, Dick, on the basketball side. It declined sequentially from where it had been the prior quarter. And forgive me, but I think Lauren said it was either a low or mid-single, I am not sure which one. But if you could talk a little bit about what's happening, particular with some of the signature shoes from some of the more established players and why you think that that business comes back?","Richard Johnson","It was up mid singles is what Lauren said in her comment, and we look at the basketball category in total, and certainly there's a lot of excitement around somebody players with Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, was Hardigg going over to Adidas, we believe that there will continue to be a lot of excitement around the signature player shoes. We also look at some of the more established players and the customers voted a little bit said we like the excitement with some of these new guys, and we continue to work with our key vendors to make sure that there's excitement across their entire basketball range and across the entire set of price points. So I'm confident that as we roll into 2016, the established players will continue to sell well and probably get back to where they have been in the past.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Then just a second question on runners point, sidestep, you mentioned that some styles were no longer as relevant there. Could you just elaborate on that and what changes are you making to adjust to that? Is there any really change in strategy to kind of the segmentation that you are doing in those stores?","Richard Johnson","There is no change to the strategy. We're working hard on the segmentation strategy to make sure that runners point is positioned as the destination for all things running, from the lifestyle running to the performance running. And that sidestep is really more of a casual lifestyle fashion led footwear destination. The fact is we fired some customers when we moved to bulk shoes and the boots et cetera out of runners point, and as we looked at the test results, there were a couple of running silhouettes that were very dependent - that runners point was very dependent on, in the German market in particular, and those have softened a little bit with Nike FREE being one of them in that particular market. So the merchant team and wrecking housing is working hard to find replacements for those silhouettes, they are working hard with our vendor partners again to make sure that we've got the right mix of product and that we can react quickly when we do see some of those trends start to change.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it.","Richard Johnson","The runners point team is hard at work establishing a connection with the runner in the local communities and seeing success with that. We've opened up a couple of flagship stores that have really resonated well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks. Good luck.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Mitch.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Svezia with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Christopher Svezia","Good morning, everyone, thanks for taking my question, and nice job in the quarter.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Chris.","Christopher Svezia","Sure. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on Europe for a moment just given the sustainability and the momentum there as you see it playing out. Maybe how much you really think is being driven by tourism versus just sort of the product momentum. And also I'm just curious when you mentioned bringing some styles that are working in Europe like I think superstar and something you are doing with the Air Force One et cetera. How is that helping you to drive the U.S. business to a degree to bring some those more casual lifestyles products to the U.S.?","Richard Johnson","Sure. Well, we certainly think that the business in Europe is sustainable, Chris. I think that the team there has done a great job of maximizing product trends, working with Thunder partners to create excitement in the stores. Our remodels over there are having a tremendous effect, the website platform that we referenced in our prepared comments, we have now got the Runners Point team and the Foot Locker Europe team on the same platform, so we're leveraging that digital content and that experience.","So we think that there is great opportunities to continue to grow the business in Western Europe, both through comp gains and store expansion. We haven't got to the point of really taking Runners Point and sidestep very far outside the German unit. One of the stores that Lauren mentioned with Runners Point is in Vienna, so we are starting to expand that, but we haven't really begun the march across Europe with that yet.","So as they look and identify styles, we have the benefit of seeing what's going on style-wise in Western Europe. Our teams are on a video call every Monday morning talking about what's working around the globe. And as we see things working, we can work with our vendor partners to make sure that those styles get adopted into the North American range if they are not, or vice versa, when things are working in the U.S. that they get adopted into the Western Europe branch.","One of the classic examples is the Teropant from Adidas that the Europeans started selling between two and three years ago and had a pretty good run with it. We brought it over to the U.S. at that time, the cuff bottomed pant, and really, the U.S. market wasn't ready for it. But the Europeans continued to have great success with it. We bought it back over about 12, 14 months ago. It was the hottest item over the last year. So our global reach, that global penetration really allows us to see what's working in other markets and allows us to adopt those products across geographies in a much quicker fashion.","Christopher Svezia","And, Lauren, just a question for you. It looks like from a long-term goal perspective based on the guidance you will be roughly at that 12.5% operating profit goal potentially at the end of this fiscal year, just several years ahead of plan. Any thoughts in and around that and the ability to go above and beyond that?","Lauren Peters","I suspect we're going to get a few I told you so. There's just no doubt. We've done a terrific job on getting after the gross margin improvement, levering the fix there, and just done an excellent job of managing the expenses in line with the top line growth. So I have confidence in this team that we will continue to focus on that kind of productivity and flow-through. I guess that's a long way of me signing that [indiscernible] I think there's still upward potential.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. All the best on the holiday. Thanks.","Lauren Peters","Thank you.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Omar Saad","Thanks. Good morning. Great job again, of course. Wanted to ask a question on the ASPs. I know it's been a benefit to you guys and some of the vendors in the space. I don't know. You guys have a better insight probably into the future product pipeline than we do, of course. Do you think that innovation is there, the product is there, the technology that is there to continue that positive AUR ASP trend that has been benefiting you and others in the sector? And that I have one follow-up. Thanks.","Richard Johnson","Yeah, the ASPs will continue to rise. I think there's a study innovation pipeline that continues to bring excitement to the product mix. And going into 2016, we're looking at an Olympic year where innovation becomes very important across many, many footwear categories, certainly, and apparel categories. One of the other things that's changing is we're creating a more premium apparel assortment, so as we look at total ticket, our apparel prices are rising as well. So there is certainly the opportunity to continue to increase ASPs.","Lauren Peters","[indiscernible] also controlling markdowns and we have some less commercial and that has the effect of increasing ASPs.","Omar Saad","Yeah, definitely. No, absolutely. You guys have done a great job at that. And then on the inventory real quick, you guys have been running so lean, really well-controlled. Do you feel like you're missing sales at all? Or is it, are you really happy to kind of keep this very lean level of inventory and manage the markdowns, as you mentioned? Or do you think there's an opportunity to boost the inventory level given the demand for the products you're selling?","Richard Johnson","I'm looking across the table at Lauren and she's got a big smile on her face. One of the things that we have to do is continue to increase our turns. So it's about the flow of product. And we installed a new merchandise allocation system which is helping us flow the product into our stores on a more timely basis. We're giving the benefit of that. Operating inventory, clean is one of the objectives that we've had internally for a long time. I think the work is paying off. Our inventory is fresh, it's clean, and I don't believe that we're missing sales. I think our store managers are surprised that right as they're selling out of product, the next product shipment is getting there, which is the way that it's supposed to work.","Omar Saad","That's great. Thanks a lot. Have a happy Thanksgiving.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti","Hey. Good morning, guys. Let me add my congrats. Great job on tough quarter.","Richard Johnson","Thank you.","Michael Binetti","Lauren, a question for you. Buying and occupancy, I think you said was maybe 10 basis points of leverage. Obviously, a little bit below what we would've expected on a nine comp. Maybe, I don't want to lead you to an answer but it reminds me of when you guys started accelerating the remodel program a few years ago in the U.S. and that upside slowed a little bit. Would you mind just letting me know if I'm wrong a right on that, or if there's something you could point to as to whether there's a change in the leverage point there?","Lauren Peters","I can confirm that you're absolutely right on that analysis [indiscernible] we had in the third quarter as opposed to the first half more dark rent periods with [indiscernible] stores closed for remods. Yeah, so no top line while that's happening. So [indiscernible] we think it's anomaly to the third quarter.","Michael Binetti","Contained to the third quarter, hopefully?","Lauren Peters","Yes.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Then help me marry two comments together please. You're been talking about mid-single digits for a while but delivering high single-digits pretty easily. But then as we think about how important you are to the basketball customer, the slowdown you talked about there, if the slowdown to mid-single digits in basketball doesn't end up being temporary, excluding any other changes, do you think at this point your position in the other categories to continuing delivering the upside to that mid-single-digit range?","Richard Johnson","Yes, we are. And I think the third quarter was a classic example of that where our job isn't to be the number one basketball seller in the world. That's one category that we drive. And I know that some folks have us pegged as the basketball guy, but we're far more than that. And this quarter proved that with a really strong quarter in running, a strong quarter in casual shoes, our merchant team taking a risk bringing boots in early and having great success through the back-to-school period, and selling an awful lot of basketball shoes.","So the work that we've done to diversify the business across product categories to create and a strong solid stool doesn't mean that every leg of the stool is going to work every quarter. And our merchant team is like a money manager; they move the money around to make sure that we are bringing the best product assortment to the customers and appealing to the customers' needs based on trends. And historically, when basketball was a much bigger chunk of our business, the stool was very uneven. Right now, our stool has four very powerful legs between basketball, running, casual shoes, and as our apparel business continues to get better, that's the fourth solid leg of the stools.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot, guys. Congrats again on a great quarter.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Camilo Lyon","Thanks. Great job, guys. My question is going to center around apparel. The first part is if you could just update us on how the apparel transition is unfolding at the Champs banner, and when you expect that to fully kind of cycle and see more traction there on the sell throughs. And then just broadly speaking on apparel, you talked about a mix to more premium product. We've noticed a greater proportion of higher end Nike sportswear in the stores, particularly at Foot Locker. Could you just help us understand r give us some insights as to is the consumer responding to that more premium product and how you think about evolving that product across more of those banners?","Richard Johnson","Sure. The Champs business, apparel continues to get better. We're still rationalizing against a much bigger licensed product business a year ago. So while the business wasn't positive at Champs for the quarter, they continue to make progress, and as we get into Q4 and then on the Q1 of 20 16, we should have cycled through most of the licensed changeover. Their private label business has been fantastic. So again, it's making sure that we've got the right branded mix, the right private label mix, the right mix of licensed to be appropriate in Champs, and then to get all of the accessories categories working as well.","And as a relates to the second question, Camilo, on the mix, the change to premium, the customer is definitely responding positively. The [indiscernible] from Nike, the Teropants from Adi, and some of the Under Armour product that we've got in stores, customers around the globe are responding to the product mix that we've got. I think it's a great step that our merchant team has taken. We sold a lot of cotton by the pound in the past, and as we continue the transition away from $9.99 T-shirts to $24.99 T-shirts with great graphics on them, the customer is responding very positively with, I would say, Europe sort of serving as the flagship right now. The business there has done a complete turn and the merchant team in Western Europe has got the right mix of branded, controlled brands and private label, and a little bit of licensed product that really is working. And they were double digits in apparel for the quarter.","In the U.S., you see the premium apparel certainly led by Tech Fleece and all of our banners, but each of the banners has a little bit different diversification of product to make that piece of their puzzle in each assortment puzzle in each store be unique. Some of the work that the Footaction team is doing with what they call the seventh avenue garmentals where they can get in and out a product very quickly because it's fashion right has really changed the dynamic in the Footaction apparel as well.","Lauren Peters","The customer is looking for something special from us, and that's what we're trying to deliver with the apparel mix changes.","Camilo Lyon","So, Lauren, with that momentum across the different manners in apparel, does that mean that 2016 could finally be the year where apparel margins succeed those footwear margins and trend to where they normally should be?","Lauren Peters","We continue to believe that ultimately the apparel margins go ahead of the footwear margins. I can tell you that we narrowed the gap in the third quarter, but we still have this case of a chase going on where we are improving margins and footwear and apparel and they haven't kept - those apparel margins of not yet gone ahead. So, yes, we still believe that, that will longer term, be a boost to the margin rate.","Camilo Lyon","Okay. All the best during the holiday season. Thanks, guys.","Lauren Peters","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Good morning, guys.","Richard Johnson","Morning, Paul.","Paul Trussell","Great quarter.","Richard Johnson","Thank you.","Paul Trussell","You checked all the boxes, frankly, this third quarter with good product and vendor diversity. You sound confident headed into the week of greatness and the holidays, and as you mentioned, next year is an Olympic year which may bring on some innovation. But stepping back from all of that, Dick, if you can just really remind us what is driving the strength overall in sneaker sales? It's gone on for a number of years, and your guidance suggested it can't continue throughout the next few years. Just put a little bit of context on us on what is driving this sustained, robust growth?","Richard Johnson","Sure. The younger generation is definitely above casualization, and they are perfectly comfortable wearing sneakers all the time. I was on train the other day and a young gentleman that doesn't work for Foot Locker was sitting on the train in a suit, suit and tie, dressed to the nines, with a beautiful pair of Nike air Max 2015's on. And I looked at him and said you were sneakers every day? He says, I wear sneakers every day because they are more comfortable than anything else I could wear. And that's really the attitude. There is a generation of dads that have grown up during the sneaker revolution, if you will. They're comfortable with their kids in sneakers, as are moms comfortable their kids in sneakers, that's going to continue.","I don't see kids putting leather shoes back on, dress shoes back on, to go to the office, to go to work, to go anywhere. So there is this generation and this feeling of comfort in a casual environment with sneakers, and using sneakers as dress sneakers. Now have dress sneakers and casual sneakers in that they're comfortable all the time. So I'm an advocate of that. I'm a believer of that. I wear sneakers every day no matter where I am. It's part of my job of course but I think that the young generation, even getting into the middle-aged folks, are finding out that sneakers are really, really comfortable.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And if we can just touch on some of the banners actually just to get a little more detail on kind of updated thoughts of where we are, specifically Footaction, if you could just help us understand what are the changes going on with the remodels, with 602 just in terms of the outlook for future growth and then just Champs, as that did underperform the core Foot Locker banner. Thanks.","Richard Johnson","Sure. Well, Footaction is relatively new in its remodel process. We've got the garden state format is what we call their new format, and where we've opened the doors, they're really performing well as Lauren mentioned in her comments. And it was a little bit of a leap of faith. We took footwear off the sidewalls and we put footwear along the back with some real highlight fixtures that call out the great footwear that the team buys, but in order to get to the footwear, we have our core consumer then walking through a lot of really fantastic apparel. And one of the biggest changes in foot action is the apparel mix that we've seen. And that's made a big difference to that consumer.","Also, the partnership spaces that we've got with Nike, we've got Nike kicks lounges, we've got Flight 23 shops that are connected to several of our Footaction GSP remodels. So good progress being made there. But as Lauren mentioned, they've got some dark days. It takes a number of weeks to get these stores completely remodeled, so as we ramp up and get more of them open, we would expect to see that performance moderate a bit.","602, as I mentioned, we opened our 28th and 29th stores. I think we've got one more to go this year, so we should end the year at 30. We're looking at the opportunities for next year. We've got a couple of flagship stores that will open here in New York, one next year on 34 Street and one early in 2017 up on Times Square. 602 will be a significant part of that. We continue to work with our vendor partners as we mentioned in the prepared remarks to get that something special on the apparel front to really drive that consumer. And we are seeing where we attach the right assets, if you well, the right people to product, much like the support that Rihanna gave to the Creeper from PUMA.","We are seeing real success. So she response to that active lifestyle fashion led environment. And we've been straight up all along that we are going to make sure that we've got 602 right before we press the full acceleration and we see that in late 2016, beginning of 2017.","So comfortable where we are at, continue to get better with 602, and Champs actually while it underperformed the Foot Locker banner, it actually over performed where it's been sequentially the last couple of quarters. So they were up low single digits, the apparel mix there is really important as we get through some of this licensed product challenge. It's funny, we haven't talked about Major League Baseball, but as we got into sort of the league finals, we had four teams, and they all produced great sales results for the Champs banner and a little bit of licensed headwear and some T-shirts, et cetera. Of the four, we would have certainly have preferred to see Toronto win because we have a great Toronto following at Champs, but that didn't happen, and we took advantage of the Kansas City win. So they are making a lot of steps forward, Paul, with Champs, and the fact that they were part of it in and up low single digits this quarter shows that there got a strong footwear business and an improving apparel business.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. Best of luck, guys.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Komp","Yeah, hi. Thanks. Dick, I wanted to follow up on some your comments. I know you talked about a lot of factors you think are driving your own fact strength for the Foot Locker banner. And maybe want to ask more on a relative basis, it looks like your relative performance gap continues to improve recently. I just want to ask if you have any high-level thoughts on maybe why that might be. If it's the strength of your relationship with the vendors, if it's the - really the broader view of the consumer and the different styles of footwear that you're offering or if it's the merchandising initiatives, or any thoughts of what's driving the relative performance?","Richard Johnson","The thing I really like, Jonathan, is when guys answer their own questions. So you hit on a lot of the real keys to what I think is driving our performance. And we really worry about what we do, we focus on what we do. We've developed great relationships with our vendor partners around the globe. We've got a global view, as I mentioned earlier, which I think really helps us. So as we see something start to work in one of our geographies, we can pass that information around all of our banners, all of our geographies and see how we can leverage that while remaining diversified in each of our U.S. and European banners. So I think that really helps our positioning across the marketplaces.","The vendor relationships are important. I think our global reach is important. I think just the strength of our team is really what drives it home. We've got people that are driven to win. They really do worry about winning every single day, and it's a testament to their resolve. Every morning they get up and they know that the scorecard is reset overnight at 0-0, and they've got to go out and win. Our team does that better than any in the Mall. And we're not afraid to invest in that business. Lauren talked about the amount of capital, something over $170 million that we've spent on our stores this year alone. So we invest, we've got a great team, we've got great relationships. And that drives our relative performance I think in the marketplace.","Lauren Peters","And all of this absolutely riveted on our customer with a very clear understanding of who the customer is for each of our banners. Great store environment for them, great merchandise for them, and a digital experience that makes sense for us, all of that with great marketing that keeps our brands at the forefront.","Jonathan Komp","Great. And maybe just a follow up on the customer portion, thinking specifically about the basketball business and some of the discussion about the established basketball marquee platforms, maybe seeing a little less momentum recently. Do you have any signs when you look at your data for that customer who was buying the LeBron or the KD, are they shifting their purchases to some of the newer styles, or is that customer just slowing down their frequency altogether and you're seeing a newer customer buy some of the younger-players styles or any thoughts on based on the data you see?","Richard Johnson","It's really a mix, I think, Jonathan, where the excitement right now, the customer happens to be in Kyrie and Steph Curry and they're really responding to that. They're looking at some of the other shoes on the shelf and saying that we need a little bit more innovation, we need a little bit better price\/value relationship, we need a little bit more out of a couple of the other signature players that you mentioned. But the fact that our basketball business in totality continues to be up tells me that the basketball consumer and the basketball silhouette is still very relevant to our core consumers. And as I mentioned earlier, I look at our merchant team really as money managers and making sure that they get they're open to buy dollars invested in absolutely the right categories to motivate this customer to be excited about the product assortment and do business with us.","Jonathan Komp","Great. Thanks. If I could just sneak one more, Lauren, any thoughts on any SG&A pressures from wages going forward? Much appreciated. Thank you.","Lauren Peters","Yes. We've talked about before, and we have for our sales associates a base plus commission structure. So they get to determine their wage and the better sales they are, the higher their wage, the higher their take-home pay. And that has worked well for us. So we're very much as we're focused on sales per square foot, we're focused on sales per payroll hour and making sure that that compensation structure rewards really great salespeople. So we're feeling good about our ability to navigate what's happening in the U.S. on wages and we'll make sure that we remain competitive.","Jonathan Komp","Great. Thanks again.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi. Please go ahead.","Katharine McShane","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","Richard Johnson","Good morning, Kate.","Katharine McShane","You had mentioned that you'd start getting the benefit of entering into an Olympic year next year. Can you just remind us how the Olympics works for Foot Locker in terms of some of the product maybe that's introduced pre-the Olympics or during the Olympics? When you start to see that in the store? And how much of a preview to that do you have?","Richard Johnson","Our vendor partners are all focused on the Olympics and the product pipeline to support the Olympics and probably the first place that gets a taste of real Olympic product is our Eastbay banner where some of the early track and field shoes, some the football cleats that will be used on the soccer picture are debuted there, actually pre or just pre or just post-Olympics, so right around that timeframe. Some of the other technologies flow into the commercial lines a little bit later, right? Flyknit was the innovation in conjunction with Lunar when you go back and look at 2012 in London, we see Flyknit, it's taken a while to get commercialized, but now it's one of the hottest things that we've got going in our stores. So there's a little bit of a curve with it, Kate, but we expect to start to see Olympic color waves, Olympic connections going into the second quarter, and then the commercialization more so after the Olympics.","Katharine McShane","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then my second question was I think mentioned before by Nike and by Under Armour, Nike is pursuing an initiative with Jordan sportswear, and Under Armour has the ARMOURY in one of your Champs stores. Can you update us on those two initiatives?","Richard Johnson","Sure. We're opening Flight 23 shops in conjunction with Footaction across a number of stores. So as we remodel Footaction, some of them - like 34th Street here in New York, certainly Del Amo out in California, State Street in Chicago have fantastic Jordan shops that open up along with Nike Kicks lounges as well. So we'll continue to expand that with Nike as we roll out more - and brand Jordan as we roll out more of our Footaction remodels. The ARMOURY is a one store buildout in the Champs doors right now but we've got plans to expand that in 2016. We've also taken some of the - we've taken it down to some wall units inside the store. So we've got a number of stores with units that look different on the wall to take some of the elements the Armory and bring it into more Champs stores. And that effort will also continue as we roll into 2016.","We operate, Kate, we have a prototype and we test some things. We test different geographies. We test different size stores. We test different markets. And once we get a level of confidence with our vendor partners, we accelerate the rollouts. But both of those are great initiatives with two really important partners.","Katharine McShane","Thank you.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Kate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Poser with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Sam Poser","Thank you for taking my question. Good morning. I've got a few here still. One, where are you - you mentioned the allocations - can you hear me?","Richard Johnson","Yeah, we're already at 10:00. So make it short.","Sam Poser","All right. Just real quick, where are you with the allocation systems? The U.S. brick-and-mortar business sounds like it was up mid-single digits. Want to confirm that. And then, Dick, when you look at your consumer, I think you're just sort of saying this, you're sort of totally ambivalent. You don't care if you're selling a basketball shoe, a running shoe, a casual shoe. You're just trying to get the right stuff for your consumer. Is that a fair point? And lastly, when you look into the holiday season with the big Jordan launches post-Thanksgiving and right before Christmas, how you feel about those two shoes relative to what happened to the big shoes you had last year?","Richard Johnson","Well, Sam, I get to be a little bit ambivalent in that the categories are somewhat driven by our consumer, not driven by me. So I really have a tremendous amount of respect for the work that our merchants do to get the right product to our consumers. and one of our strengths is that we are so laser focused on that consumer by banner and as the consumer moves a little bit, as some of those lifestyle preferences change a little bit, as the bottoms that they're choosing to wear, whether it be a [indiscernible] pant or a denim jean, that drives a lot of the sneaker choices. Sometimes basketball is the perfect silhouette, sometimes running is the perfect silhouette. But our team does a really, really good job of getting those categories and those products merchandised appropriately. So I like to drive sales. I like the customer to wear what they're most comfortable wearing. We don't have a bounty on any specific category, to say the least. We want to drive them all.","I look at our Week of Greatness, which starts tomorrow, Sam, and I know you talked about some of the launches that are upcoming. I like the way the calendar lines up for us. The Week of Greatness has got some fantastic shoes that actually start today with the Curry 2 and then roll out significantly over the next week. Great shoes across our markets each day of the season or of the Week of Greatness, I should say. And then when we get to the pre-Christmas launches, again, I like the way the calendar lines up and the way the shoes line up. So we have a degree of confidence certainly going into the holiday season.","Sam Poser","And then about the allocation?","Lauren Peters","Yeah, [indiscernible] the allocation is [indiscernible] is up and running and has been for the better part of a year for the North American business and Europe. The next phase of it is the order of planning module that lets us impact the orders that we write, and that is an early 2016 pilot.","Sam Poser","Thank you very much. Continued success.","Richard Johnson","Thank you.","John Maurer","Okay. Operator, I think that's all we have time for today. We appreciate everybody's participation on our call today, and we look forward to having you join us on our next call which we currently expect with take place at 9:00 a.m. on Friday, February 26, following the release of our fourth quarter and full year earnings results earlier that morning.

Thank you for joining us. We have a lot to cover today and will follow our usual format with Lauren Peters, Foot Locker's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, starting us off with a detailed review of our financial results for the quarter and the year; followed by Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will update you on some of the key initiatives we are executing now to drive future business performance as well as some of the big picture industry trends affecting the business.","Our prepared remarks will conclude with an overview by Lauren of our current annual and quarterly expectations for fiscal 2018.","Before we get to that though, let me orient everyone on a fourth quarter that included many moving parts. As reported, our loss for the quarter was $0.40 per share. However, this result was heavily impacted by several significant onetime charges. Starting first with our tax-specific items, we recorded incremental U.S. tax expense of $99 million in the quarter, related to what is commonly described as the toll charge or the deemed repatriation of offshore earnings.","Second, we recorded $2 million of tax expense in the fourth quarter related to a tax rate change in France. And third, we incurred an $8 million tax valuation allowance related to the Runners Point Group, primarily due to the fact that our ability to utilize the tax laws carry-forwards we had previously recorded is no longer considered likely.","These tax items totaled $109 million or $0.90 per share. Without them, non-GAAP EPS would have been a positive $0.50. Turning to some pre-tax items, we impaired $4 million of mostly store assets at Runners Point and Sidestep. And we booked a pre-tax charge of $16 million, $10 million after tax to impair certain store assets of SIX:02. These banners are underperforming relative to the financial standards we set for all of our businesses.","Finally, we also recorded an incremental $128 million pre-tax charge or $81 million after-tax for pension litigation based on the Supreme Court's recent decision not to consider our appeal of a lower court's decision against the company. Taken together, these additional charges were $148 million pre-tax and $95 million after tax or an incremental $0.76 per share.","Adding this back to the $0.50 per share just noted, brings non-GAAP EPS to a $1.26. This EPS figure is comparable to the most recent facts that consensus earnings projection of $1.25. 2017 also contained an extra week and as expected this 53rd week produced $0.12 per share of earnings, but the 13-week non-GAAP earnings for Q4 to which we will be referring today and next year is the $1.14","A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided via reference in the press release issued earlier this morning. The $1.14 of Q4 earnings brought our full year 52-week non-GAAP earnings to $3.99. Again, this is the 2017 earnings base against which we will be comparing our performance throughout fiscal 2018.","One last point before I turn the call over to Lauren. Since our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than usual today. We have included a table in the press release that provides some of the items Lauren typically discloses in her commentary. That way she and Dick can focus their comments on today's most important matters. Lauren?","Lauren Peters","Thanks for the detailed recap, John. And thank you all for joining us this morning. As noted on our press release, comparable sales declined 3.7%, within but towards the lower end of our expectations going into the quarter. When we gave comp guidance for Q4 on our previous call, we were tracking November comp that were running up low-single-digits, which encouraged us to slightly improve our expected comp range for the quarter.","December comp is down low-mid-single digits, within our expectation. However, with few big shopping moments in January, product heat fell off a bit, as did traffic, leading to a low double-digit cost decline in that month that was below our expectation.","Total sales on a 13-week basis were essentially flat, but the impact of stronger foreign currencies, contributing approximately $50 million to the top line. The 53rd week also added $95 million of sale.","In terms of segments or direct-to-customer businesses collectively produced an overall comparable sales gain of 4.3%. As a percent of total sales, DTC increased to 16.1% for the quarter, up from 15.3% a year ago.","As a group, our store division posted a 5.1% comparable sales decline. Similar to the results we experienced in the third quarter, apparel was a highlight, delivering a comparable sales gain at the high-end of mid-single-digits, its 7th consecutive quarter with positive comp growth. Results were driven by branded fleece and big logo T-shirts, which remains very much on trend, as well as the new NBA apparels from Nike.","Footwear remains challenged, declining mid-single-digits. Footwear comps were down low-single-digits in men's, mid-single-digits in kids', and double-digits in women. By category, men's running was again the strongest component of Footwear and posted a high-single-digit comp gain, while men's basketball was down high-single-digits.","Finally, sales of casual styles in men's footwear dropped off by double-digits. A strong sales of Vans' classic style were more than offset by declines in Timberland boots, certain Adi styles and Converse.","In terms of the rest of the income statement, gross margin declined 230 basis points to 31.4% of sales on a 14-week basis. The lower rate was driven by a 210 basis point decrease in our merchandise margin rate and 20 basis points of deleverage of our occupancy and buyers' compensation expenses.","The lower-than-expected merchandise rate was driven by higher markdowns on Footwear, both in stores and online, as we work diligently to clear slow-moving products and maintain a healthy inventory position going into 2018.","Across most of our geographies and channels, markdowns were heaviest in court classics and select casual running silhouettes. Despite the higher markdown, overall average selling prices were up in the quarter, with units down mid-single-digits. Our SG&A expense rate increased to 19.1% of sales, also on a 14-week basis from 18.7% of sales a year ago.","Although our teams managed expenses tightly in the quarter and throughout the year, the deleverage reflects some of the investments we are making to drive the business forward over the long term, which Dick will be talking about in a moment, as well as continuing wage pressures and higher healthcare cost. Higher FX rates also added 10 basis points to our SG&A rate in the quarter.","Our fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 31.7%, below last year's 35.1%, much of which was due to the impact of U.S. tax reform, which enabled us to apply a tax rate to our full year net income that was a blend of pre and post-tax reform rates.","Turning to capital allocation, we invested approximately $270 million of capital in the business in 2017, reflecting management's and the board's confidence in our ability to fund and execute initiatives to drive improved business results in the future.","At the same time, we spent $105 million to repurchase 2.8 million shares during the quarter, bringing the full year outlay to $467 million to repurchase 12.4 million shares or close to 10% of the shares outstanding at the start of the year. We also returned a $157 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends during 2017, which brought our total return to shareholders for the year to $624 million.","As we announced last week, our board declared 11% increase to our quarterly dividend payout rate to $0.345 per share. And at yearend, we had $758 million remaining on the $1.2 billion share repurchase program that was authorized a year ago.","We ended the quarter with $849 million of cash and cash equivalents, down $197 million from the end of Q4 last year. Much of the reduction was due to the prefunding of $150 million of our pension litigation liability. That cash is still on our balance sheet, but because it is now restricted, it shows up in other assets.","We already repatriated some cash from overseas before yearend. And given U.S. tax reform, we now have much greater flexibility to deploy our cash to the highest value opportunities for our business. As John mentioned, the pension liability increased by another $128 million in the quarter, bringing the total to $278 million. We expect to fund this incremental $128 million during 2018 from available cash.","Before I hand the call over to Dick, I'll just briefly on inventory. That actual FX rate inventory ended the quarter down 2.2% or $29 million from a year-ago. Using constant currencies inventory decreased 5.2% compared to total sales, which as I mentioned were essentially flat on a 13-week basis. This excellent inventory performance allowed us to actually increased inventory turns slightly for the year, despite the top line challenges.","As we were to ensure that we begin 2018 with the flexibility to flow in the depth and variety of exciting product assortments we see coming from our key vendor partners as the year unfold. I'll be back in a bit to give more specific guidance for 2018, but first, I'll turn the call over to Dick to provide more detail on the key initiatives we are undertaking across our business.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate having you on the call today to discuss both our performance in the quarter and how we see the year ahead shaping up. Last quarter, I've outlined several key initiatives we are executing to rapidly and proactively transform our business, in order to stay engaged with our customers at the center of an exceptionally dynamic youth culture.","Connecting with our customers is the foundation of what we do as a company. As a reminder, our general managers now have fully integrated sales and profit responsibility regardless of channel. We have created North American product to marketing strategy team to leverage the power of our portfolio of banners to scale ideas and stories that resonate powerfully with our consumers.","We are concentrating and accelerating a greater proportion of our capital and operating expenditures on a variety of digital initiatives. We are enhancing our supply chain capabilities, not only as it relates to our primary distribution centers, but also to test mini hub distribution functionality.","And we are continuing to invest in our store fleet, as we execute our remodel program across most banners adding key new doors, which typically include one or more dedicated vendor spaces and testing off-mall retail formats to reduce our exposure to deteriorating malls, even though we remain profitable and almost all of them. We continue to move forward and all of these long-term initiatives, which are proceeding broadly in line with our expectations, so I won't go into them in any more detail today.","We are doing everything we can to accelerate not just our digital initiatives, but every facet of our business. It's critical for each of us in the business to move faster and embrace the inevitable change that is affecting retail. Only by doing so can we continue to create meaningful engagement with our customers on their quest for self-expression and fulfill their passion for personalized connections to the people, experiences and products that are important to them.","One additional initiative for 2018, which we expect to begin moving forward on later this year, it's the Foot Locker banners expansion into Asia. We intend to enter the region with an integrated store and e-commerce strategy in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, and possibly also with the platform partner Mainland China by the end of the year.","While, we are excited about the potential this expansion affords, I would add that for 2018, the sales and P&L estimates are not material with just the few million dollars of capital allocated to get us started. We expect the opportunity to increase significantly as we get into 2019 and 2020, and we'll keep you updated as we get this initiative up and running.","Another initiative, one that took place during the fourth quarter was investing a $15 million stack in Carbon38. This exciting, vibrant early stage company has quickly become the go-to site for women who value both a luxury experience and beautiful apparel that simultaneously serves her fitness and fashion needs. The core customer of Carbon38 is quite a bit different from SIX:02s customer base. For one thing, Carbon38's price points tend to be meaningfully higher than SIX:02's. However, there are certainly enough overall similarities between them that we believe there are opportunities to learn a lot from each other to elevate our respective businesses.","The investment is a minority stake, we are not contemplating any cross-selling of owned brands, at least in the near-term. With Lauren now in the Carbon38 Board of Directors, however, there will undoubtedly be a lot of constructive dialogue between us, about how we lever the best of both teams.","We're definitely excited about what this new approach to investing may bring Foot Locker. While, this was just one relatively small investment for us, we've recognized that there may be additional opportunities to tap into capabilities and talent through partnerships, investments or perhaps acquisitions as we pursue ways to transform our business in serving and increasingly demanding youth culture. That said, let me add that we don't have any other such details to talk about today, nor will we speculate about any particular potential opportunities.","One important external item that happened during the fourth quarter was certainly U.S. tax reform. While, it took quite a chunk out of our profits in Q4, quite a chunk as a technical accounting finance term that Lauren has taught me over time. It will also increase our future earnings significantly.","The extra cash flow certainly gives us good options, although, as we have said, we haven't really been capital constrained in the past. We made productive investments in the business globally across our stores, supply chain, digital platforms, and other infrastructure.","As Lauren just mentioned, we have also returned a lot of cash to our shareholders. What we don't always talk about as much as we should is the investments that we have made in our people. Over the past couple of years, we have made multimillion dollar investments, in additional compensation for our people. Positively affecting more than 30,000 store associates globally, and keeping us competitive in the marketplace.","We will be making additional multimillion dollar investments in our compensation plans in 2018, especially for our system store managers, recognizing how important these associates are in connecting with our customers and enhancing their experiences within our banners. And we will continue to make investments in our talents in the years ahead. While, Lauren will give you the details of our outlook for 2018 in just a moment, let me prep her remarks by discussing some of the big picture industry trends as we see them today.","First, the disruption that has characterized the retail industry recently is not going away. Consumers want experiences, they want cool product, and they want it all, fast. As I pointed out, we are working diligently on our own strategies to adapt to the evolving customer, and we are also working in close collaboration with our key vendors, such as Nike and Adidas, and their initiatives to increase the speed at which athletic footwear and apparel are brought to market.","The partnership to capture speed is a multiyear imperative for all of us in the athletic industry. In the overall relationship with our top vendors continues to be just that, a true partnership in serving sneaker-obsessed consumers. While, our suppliers all have a growing direct-to-customer business component of their business, they are just as importantly concentrating their much larger wholesale business on the handful of retail partners like us who not only share their vision of connecting and engaging with customers on a personal and exponential basis, but also have the wherewithal to execute that vision effectively.","For our part, we will continue to transform our business to remain the premier destination for the most premium sneakers, apparel and accessories in the market across multiple brands. We are collaborating with all of our top vendors, Nike, Jordan, Adidas, Puma, Timberland, Under Armour, Vans, New Balance, ASICS and Converse, to name just a few, to cultivate, develop and implement unique product platforms and stories, which we alone have the capabilities and retail footprint to scale globally.","But we are doing more than that. We are redefining our vision statement to move beyond simply being a retailer of shoes and apparel, to truly inspiring and empowering youth culture. We are also creating a new framework to guide and prioritize our strategies.","Our work on this effort is not quite finished though, thus we are not ready to unveil the details today. However, we do expect that later this year we'll be able to gather our investors and analysts together to discuss our ideas for propelling the business successfully into the future. We'll certainly keep you posted on our progress.","Before I turn the call back to Lauren, let me conclude my remarks by saying that most of the challenges we faced in 2017 were not unique to us. The dramatic shifts influencing the expectations and behaviors of our customers affected all of retail. And while our sales and profit results were not what we expected going into the year, I believe the efforts, passion, intensity, of our global team of associates was every bit as strong this year as it was in recent years of record financial performance, perhaps even more so.","I can't turn the page on 2017 without thanking every one of our associates for their dedication and perseverance in the face of such fundamental changes and challenges as the year brought. I believe they worked hard to successfully position our company for better results in 2018. And more importantly, they continued that vital work to create a business that will be inspiring and serving youth culture for multiple generations to come.","With that summary, I'll let Lauren describe in more detail what that means for next year.","Lauren Peters","Thanks again, Dick. Let's start again with the top-line. We believe that we will inflect back to comparable sales gains during 2018. While we expect the year to start off challenged with comp decline in Q1, similar to or perhaps even higher than our experience in the second half of 2017, we do believe that the much anticipated inflection point should come with a significantly improved product flow in the summer and back-to-school.","Q2 comps should be flat to up slightly. We are planning for a low-single-digit comparable sales increase in Q3 and Q4, with strengthening within that range likely as we progress through the year. Altogether, we expect a flat to low-single-digit comp sales gain for the year. With foreign currency stronger now relative to the U.S. dollar than they were at the same time last year, our total sales should get a slight incremental boost in the first half of the year, provided exchange rates stay close to where they are now with the euro above $1.20 and the Canadian and Australian dollars above $0.75.","Product margins should also recover as the year progresses. Although, with promotional activity still high in the first quarter and occupancy delevering on the negative comp, gross margin could fall 150 to 175 basis points in Q1. After that, the depth of premium product should improve more substantially and markdown pressure should lessen as we go through the rest of the year. With occupancy rates up slightly for the full year, overall gross margin should improve 30 to 40 basis points in total for the year.","With the substantial investments we are making in our digital operation, which come with both a capital and operating expense impact, our SG&A expense rate is expected to be up approximately 100 basis points year over year. Depreciation and amortization expense will increase from the $173 million we recorded for 2017 to approximately $180 million in 2018.","A $230 million capital program for 2018 includes about 40 new stores, down from recent years in which we've approached 100 new stores a year, and approximately 110 stores, which are expected to close.","We continue to prune the fleet of underproductive stores and open a few select high-profile stores, among which is just a couple of weeks, our new Champs Sports flagship store in Times Square, opposite that our other new Times Square property that houses a Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and SIX:02. Footaction, in partnership with Jordan, will soon open the latest Jumpman store in LA.","And finally, we will open two exciting new power stores in the UK in early summer, one in Liverpool and the other on Oxford Street in London. Included in the total of new stores is also a handful of Foot Locker locations in Asia, as Dick described earlier.","Interest income in 2017 was $2 million. Interest will likely still be income in 2018, but the amount may be somewhat lower than last year depending on the timing of paying the pension litigation liability, we now have on the balance sheet. That brings me to our income tax rate. In recent years, our non-GAAP effective tax rate has been in the neighborhood of 35%, give or take a few tens of basis points.","Starting next year we estimate our effective tax rate will be approximately 27.5%. State and local taxes as well as foreign tax rates that are now higher on average than the U.S. push up the rate from the base federal rate of 21%. Adding it all up, we expect earnings per share to increase at a solid double-digit percentage pace in 2018 compared to the $3.99, we earned in 2017 on the non-GAAP 52-week basis that John walked you through at the beginning of the call.","Without the effective tax reform, we believe earnings would be up at a mid-single-digit pace in 2018. While this is below the pace, we have been routinely achieving prior to 2017, the overhang of a highly promotional marketplace early in the coming year, and expected comp decline in Q1, and our elevated investments in digital capabilities factor into our expectations for earnings growth this year.","This growth includes a benefit of a few cents per share and stronger foreign currency rates in the first half of the year. It also assumes a lower share count based on the continued execution of the $1.2 billion share repurchase program we started in 2017. As always the pace and timing of repurchases will be opportunistic based on a variety of factors, so we can't give you more specific guidance than that on share count.","Last but not least, I want to address the inevitable question about the 53rd week shift. As I'm sure, most of you know we use the Standard National Retail Federation 4-5-4 calendar. In the 53rd week of 2017 shifts the week to keep them comparable year-over-year for that comp store sales statistic. However, please note, for your modeling that reported annual and quarterly sales and profits are not shifted. And as a result there will be a significant variation in total sales and profits by quarter relative to comp.","For example, with most U.S. income tax refund checks no longer getting into people's hands in late January, early February, the week spanning the February 1, which fell out of Q1 into the 53rd week generated about $10 million less on sales than we expect the first week of May will. That week of May is now in our first fiscal quarter.","Even more significantly, the first week of August, which is an early back-to-school week now falls in Q2, and historically does about $50 million more in sales than the first week of May, I just mentioned.","In other words, total sales in these first two quarters will be higher than suggested by the comp results. In contrast, the opposite happens in the third quarter, as we trade that significant back-to-school week in August for a relatively light week at the end of October. We expect this trade to negatively affect total sales in Q3 by around $60 million.","Finally, that relatively light October week, still generates about $20 million more in sales than the last week of January. So to recap: plus $10 million, plus $50 million, minus $60 million, minus $20 million, for a net minus $20 million impact on sales for the year.","What's important to remember about these shifts, of course, is that leverage of occupancy and SG&A or deleverage as the case may be, is based on total sales volume in the quarter. So these rates will be affected by these 53rd week shift. In addition, of course, to FX rates and the store count changes.","Another change for 2018 relates to our segment reporting. With Dick reviewing the business on the basis of integrated sales channel and the General Managers of each of our banners having sales and profit responsibility for all sales channels combined, it no longer makes sense for us to do separate reporting for a stores segment and a direct-to-consumer segment.","Going forward, we will report just one segment. While we will continue to disclose sales by those channels, we will no longer provide operating profit detail. One last item, before we get to your questions. We'll be changing responsibility for Investor Relations over the coming months. We are in the process of transitioning IR to Jim Lance, our recently appointed Vice President Corporate Finance.","Jim has been with the company almost 30 years, serving in a variety of roles, most recently as the CFO of all of our North American banners and responsible for the field organization as well as finance. In addition to Investor Relations, Jim will also be in charge of the company's financial planning and analysis function, and our field audit team.","You will enjoy getting to know Jim. And his deep knowledge of our business and customers will be especially useful for investors.","John, who has been our primary Investor Relations Officer for the past seven years, will continue as Vice President and Treasurer, and is adding significant new risk management responsibilities to his existing portfolio. The transition will not be sudden. It will take place over the next few months. But it will get started right after this call, when Jim will be with John as he answers whatever questions we can't get to in the next several minutes.","Let me end there, and ask Dorothy to open up the call for your question now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Mitch Kummetz with Pivotal Research is online with a question.","Mitch Kummetz","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I guess a couple things. First of all, just in terms of the guidance, Lauren the way you kind of laid out the year, it doesn't sound like you expect the comps to go positive until the back-half. I'm a little surprised by that.","I mean, Q2 is your easiest comparison, like what are you guys seeing terms of the product pipeline that gives you confidence, that you get to a positive comp in the back-half? And what's happening currently? There seems to be a fair amount of newness out there, but that newness isn't driving better results, particularly against a pretty easy Q2 comparison?","Richard Johnson","Well, Mitch - and this is Richard - there is no easy comparison quite honestly. So it's - I understand what your numbers saying, what your math says, but when you have to deliver against it, it's an entirely different equation. So there is some newness and freshness. And we believe that the depth in that newness and freshness will continue to ramp up throughout this quarter, second quarter and into the back-half.","But one of those things you have to remember is that our company makes, places big bets on products, right? So we have some overhang from the fourth quarter. The marketplace continues to be fairly promotional. As we monitor and drive against our comp in the first quarter, we're trying to make sure that we manage our inventory appropriately, manage your markdowns appropriately and stay fresh for one week. Have the more depth of this heat that we talked about coming to us.","Lauren Peters","Let me just share - clarify. We're looking for Q2 to be flat, up slightly, as that product flow increases over the year.","Mitch Kummetz","And then, Dick, this is a follow-up to that. Some of it obviously or a lot of it obviously is in terms of the new product and your ability to get more of that. But how much of it is also a function of - and you talked about a couple of brands that weren't great for you in the quarter. How much of it is a function of that there are certain franchises or products that that have been in decline now for the last few quarters and that it just takes some time before you start to sort of fully lap some of those declines?","And I don't know if you can even - ever hit this point. You have the visibility to kind of know when some of those things bottom out. But I guess you have more confidence that you will be past some of that by back-half versus kind of what your visibility shows you for the first half? Is that - how much of it is a function of that as well?","Richard Johnson","Yeah, that's certainly a part of it, Mitch. The fact that we just placed these big bets means that if something slows down quicker than we anticipated, we have to work our way through that inventory. And we've talked about some of the slower moving silhouettes in the past. We're getting through some of that remaining inventory and we're managing the flow.","So we have the clarity. We don't always know when things are going to slow down as quickly as some of them did in 2017. But we react accordingly and one of the challenges is just the size of the inventory that we have in some of the silhouettes that we have to move through. So you've got the picture painted absolutely correctly.","Mitch Kummetz","Okay, all right, thank you.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Mitch.","Operator","Randy Konik with Jefferies is online with the question.","Randy Konik","Hey, just want to kind of elaborate. I think in the press release you talked about flat traffic in the quarter. So is - these footwear comps, is that - were the units actually up in all the mid-single-digit decline and the comp was driven by ASP reduction? And I think you made also a comment around increasing the depth of premium products I think in the back-half of 2018.","So give us maybe some perspective on the markdown differentiation or differential between the premium product? I'm assuming that the markdown rates there are pretty healthy and low. And how does that compare to a depth of markdown rates that are going on in the, I guess, the non-premium part of the scale or the spectrum.","Richard Johnson","Well, to be clear, we - Lauren commented a bit, that ASPs were actually up in the quarter. Units were down, but ASPs were up. So even in the markdown realm - markdown world that we were operating in, the mix of our product, the mix of our categories allow the ASPs to be up in the quarter. So, again, the team does a great job of managing the flow of markdowns against the flow of premium product.","And we continue to have a leadership position across the premium product and we will see depth and certain packages continue to expand as we get into the second quarter and certainly in the back-to-school in the back-half.","Randy Konik","And then, when give us some perspective on the elevated SG&A related to digital investment, how should we be thinking about the physical footprint, not just in the United States, but if we have over 3,000 stores across 20 plus countries? What do we supposed to be thinking about from the marriage of what's the physical branch should look like versus the digital story over the next couple years? How should we think that changes with the organization over the next three to five years?","Richard Johnson","I think we were clear about the 2018 plan. We've about 40 doors that will open in exciting new places and new doors in new countries even. We're going to close - right now, it looks like about 110.","Again, we're very opportunistic. Our store development and real estate team does a great job of working with landlords. The question is on where does the sale take place, where does the transaction take place, because it's going to take place wherever our consumer wants it take place.","We want to provide exciting engaging opportunities for the consumer on their digital device, because that's where they first start interacting with us, and culminate that wherever they choose to buy. If they want to select the buy-now button while they're on our app or on the site, that's great. If we can motivate them to come to the store and experience the environment there with our associates and the energy that exists in our stores, that's great as well.","And that's one of the reasons that the investment in digital is far more than a just commerce platform. It's about our ability to communicate effectively and create great engagement with our core customers.","Lauren Peters","Right. It is intended to make that experience, both digitally and in the store, better. To make that experience hang together well across those channels, if you will, and to have a more personalized communication with our customer. We know what's important to them. To be able to communicate with them down there what's important to them as an individual is really going to be a very powerful thing.","Randy Konik","Thanks. Just lastly, the guidance on the comp for the first quarter, is that reflective of some sudden change in trend that you noted? I think, you said the word was drop-off, when you described the cash flow business being down double-digits in the - I guess, the men's in the footwear in the fourth quarter? Is that kind of where we get a little bit more of the - a lot of the driver if you will of the comp guidance for the - and the margin guidance maybe as well for the first quarter? Is that a big driver the drop-off in the casual business?","Richard Johnson","The continuation, Randy, what we saw in Q4, we expected that some of this markdown pressure and promotional pressure in the marketplace might recede. But it clearly hasn't, so we're working to remain competitive in the marketplace and make sure that our inventory is fresh and clean, but it's not a sudden change. It's truly just a continuation of some of the activity that we saw in Q4.","Randy Konik","Understood. I appreciate the answers. Thank you.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Randy.","Operator","Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank is online with a question.","Paul Trussell","Yeah. Good morning.","Richard Johnson","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Trussell","The U.S. Foot Locker and Champs Sport businesses according to your table were down just low-single-digits, I believe. But the European business was down double-digits. What's the reason for that wide variance? And how long should we expect those weak European trends to continue? And while, I know you guide on a consolidated basis, perhaps, just touch a bit more on your expectations for the U.S. marketplace and in terms of moving it a top line that's in positive territory and cleaner margin trends.","Richard Johnson","Yeah. There's been some traffic challenges in - across Europe, Paul, and we saw that manifest itself certainly in the back half of the year and a little bit more in Q4. Obviously, the weather that's there right now is not helping their start of fiscal 2018, but weather passes. In that traffic is somewhat driven by the changing trends. The brand heat and the relative nature of certain product categories is different in Europe.","So we see a little bit of a traffic difference that the team there is certainly working to get the assortment right and speak loudly to their core consumers. And a lot of the digital work that we are talking about a lot of the investments that we're making will certainly benefit the European market as well. And we don't really provide guidance by geography or by banner, it's important for us to look at the business from a consolidated point of view.","And as we look at the European business specifically, we know that there are assortment shifts, as we get into the second quarter back-to-school. We see an improving Nike business there. We see depth coming in some of the Adidas product that's been strong for them. So that's why we feel a little bit like we'll see an improving trend there.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And then just maybe touch on SG&A then a bit more in detail. Last quarter, you made a number of reductions, I believe, across your infrastructure. You're also highlighting this morning some elevated and accelerated digital investments, just discuss a bit more the puts and takes there?","Lauren Peters","Yeah, Paul, the - the reorg restructure that we did in Q3, those savings are contemplated in the guidance that we've given. And indeed, part of the reason for doing that was to make sure that we have the right skill set to drive the initiatives going forward. And our digital investment is significant as we think about that future potential. So all of that contemplated in the guidance that we gave on SG&A, that and further investments in our field org.","Paul Trussell","All right, best of luck.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Sam Poser with Susquehanna Financial is online with a question.","Sam Poser","Thank you for taking my question. Good morning.","Richard Johnson","Good morning.","Sam Poser","Just a quick follow-up on the trends by - in the - that sort of divergence between the international business and the majority of the U.S. business, production was down significantly as well as the international markets with the exception of RPG Group. So could you give us some more color as to what's working or working better at, let's say, Foot Locker, Champs and Kid versus what's going on in the other stores?","Richard Johnson","A lot of the same product is working, Sam, and it's how quickly each of the banners get into the product and how much depth they get as they prioritize things with our vendor partners. So we saw - we've had a really nice run with Vans. And some of our brands, we're able to get on Vans a little bit sooner than other of our banners.","Champion Fleece is another great example, where we were able to see some success in the European market with that, and some of the U.S. banners were able to jump on that very quickly. So we have an independent merchant group for each of our banners, obviously, and we have different muses and target consumers for the banner. So they don't all move in perfect sync. Some have a higher dependency on basketball. Some have a higher dependency on running.","And as there are puts and takes across those product categories, you'll see banners that perform or outperform others. And that's just - that's the nature of the beast that I don't believe we've always - that we've ever had every banner moving in exact synced step.","Sam Poser","Okay. And then, you sort of hinted, I mean, the consumer - the speed, you brought up speed earlier, the speed of change, is how do you sort of - scales when the kids attention span might be or the sneaker enthusiast's attention span may be used to be a month, and now it might be two weeks. How do you - have enough - not too much of product before the kid gets off of it, and then move out of the next thing more quickly? Or is that all the stuff that's about to happen as we look ahead into, I would assume, like you Q1 into Q2 and beyond?","Richard Johnson","Well, that's the transition of the entire industry is going through, Sam. We have a very long planning cycles, we have very long production cycles, and we have consumers whose attention span to your point is shortening quickly. So with our vendor partners and their speed initiatives and our ability to learn from other divisions around the globe, we really are well positioned to move quicker.","But our industry still does move too slow, and I think that our vendor partners are certainly addressing that with their efforts around speed, their developmental cycles are shortening, their ability to produce product is getting quicker. So as we - and we've sort of started to understand that as well that the big bets that we place have to be bets that are going to disappear on a much quicker product lifecycle.","Lauren's got a great visual that she uses that shows the old bell shaped curve of how products sold and how that peak gets really steep at this point. So our merchant team is learning how to quickly adapt to that speed of the consumer. But we are in an industry that still moves a bit slower than the consumer in the efforts that we've got going on with ourselves and with our vendor partners are really designed to try to get after this customer quicker.","Sam Poser","But I guess the question is aren't the big bets going to be - aren't you going to need like the bigger bets are going to get smaller, but you're going to need more of them? So for instance, if you had a shoe that you thought you could sell 100,000 pairs of over 10 weeks, maybe now that shoe only lasts four weeks, and you only need 50,000 pairs. And then you need the next thing of 50,000 pairs. I mean, isn't that what it's going to require for the definition of big bets has to change just because the lifecycle of the shoes is less?","Richard Johnson","Well, in some cases that maybe true, Sam, right. But I don't think in general, right, I mean, our job is to drive the intensity around the peak and make sure that we've got enough to satisfy that peak. And then be willing to move on to the next, whether, that's a factor of two, like you talked about or factor of a half. That's what our merchant team - that's what the data analytics that we're using to study the consumer behavior will help inform us about. But I don't believe, it's as simple as an old big bet was 100, the new big is 50 and you move on. The consumer's demand is - we have to satisfy that demand in the moment.","Sam Poser","But - one last thing, real quick. Is it better to satisfy the demand or leave a little demand on the table, and then so you think of theirs demand for x, you should have x minus something. So people are still hungry and ready to go to the next thing, because if you satisfied demand there's a risk that you could end up with excess inventory and have to cleanup on your end?","Richard Johnson","Yeah. Don't misunderstand. We believe that there should be demand left on the table, right. We're not going to satisfy the last customer with the last unit. That just simply will not happen.","Lauren Peters","Our positioning is premium product on the front end. So, yes, we would agree that there should be in that category, demand left on the table.","Richard Johnson","Absolutely.","Sam Poser","Great. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Sam. Thank you.","Operator","Kate McShane with Citi Research is online with a question.","Kate McShane","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My question is on the basketball category. Just with price points having come down, the fact that there has been a new product, the fact that the NBA is still pretty popular, what brings that category back? And what can we expect with regards to the mix of that business within the Foot Locker banners over the - over 2018?","Richard Johnson","Yeah, Kate, I think the excitement always emanates from product, right. I mean, Lauren talked about the NBA apparel that Nike is doing as being more exciting than that apparel have been in the past. And we've seen our customer sort of move that direction.","On the Footwear side, it's not necessarily the big game shoe that's driving the excitement. It's some of the specific player additions that are much smaller hits that are driving the heat. But we certainly are seeing some energy around the LeBron shoe. We're seeing some energy around Kyrie. I think that as the storytelling around some of the Jordan Retro product gets cleaner and closer to the base consumer that product will continue to resonate as Jordan does a great job of controlling the marketplace with that.","So it's - I'm - we're less worried about what the category percentages are, as we've said many times. We're concentrating on making sure that we've got the right depth and the right heat for the product regardless of what category it falls in. But we do see some heat coming in basketball.","Kate McShane","Okay. And when we think about the comp cadence throughout this year, how should we think about it unit versus price?","Lauren Peters","Yeah. We have had this trend of stronger ASPs and our unit challenge for a while now. So as you think about first quarter and - being challenged, second quarter being challenged, but a bit less and improvement in the back half. I don't see a change in the ASP direction, but units would improve.","Kate McShane","Okay. Okay, great. And if I can just sneak in one more question about stores, you had mentioned, Dick, in your prepared comments about the door closures and maybe focusing a little bit more on off-mall versus mall. I just wondered, if you could expand on that a little bit more and any indication of what that mix has currently in the U.S. off-mall versus mall?","Richard Johnson","Well, as we see mall starting to deteriorate, we know that even though the mall goes downhill, the customer doesn't leave that neighborhood and wants to be served. So we're testing some off-mall power stores. We're testing some off-mall formats that we see as great opportunities to stay very relevant and hyper local to that customer, while we try to connect with them digitally, obviously. But again, we have a fair amount of transactions that are done in cash that - the consumer loves to engage with us digitally, but they want to transact with us in stores. So we continue to test and will evolve that. And we haven't really talked about our mall versus street percentages.","Lauren Peters","Yeah, we're about - so this is really a U.S. conversation around the mall. We're about 15% off-mall in the U.S. today, 85% mall. But as you look back at our store closure, opening cadence by geography, we've been net closers in the U.S. for quite some time as we have been trimming the underperformers in the fleet.","So we find ourselves at this place, where we still had good traffic in what would be lower-rated malls in the U.S. But we - so, clearly, the customers still want to shop in store. If the mall goes away he's still going to want to shop in his neighborhood. So that's off-mall strategy, to find that property and the format mix that works. And the profit dynamics off-mall should be attractive.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Operator","Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities is online with the question.","Robert Drbul","Hi, good morning. Actually, I have two questions. The first one is when you - again, the decision on Asia, how many stores will be added, I guess, and when you think about the marketplace there sort of many - mono-brand stores versus multi-branded stores, can you just elaborate on the opportunity there?","And the second question is more of a bigger picture question, Dick. Do you think, in terms of the industry today, are the direct to consumer efforts by some of the big brands impacting the market more and do you think that similar question on like the resale market that's sort of expanding in the marketplace, is that also becoming a bigger factor? Thanks very much.","Richard Johnson","Well, thanks, Bob. I'll start with Asia and we're not going to get into the door-count. As we said in the prepared remarks, we've got a few million dollars in capital to get us started. And it really is a fully integrated model that we're going to open with, so both stores and digital engagement with the consumers.","And I think if you track historically our industry, markets get full of mono-branded stores and there's a tremendous opportunity to bring a multi-braded store like Foot Locker to bear in those markets. So we believe the timing is right. We believe the market is right. And we think that there's certainly opportunity based on the sneaker obsession that many of these consumers have. So we're optimistic, but again, we'll bring you along with some results as we start to see them later in this year.","And certainly then shifting to your second question, certainly, the vendors all have a DTC component of their business. We understand that. But I think one of the things that we've been clear about and they have been clear about as well is that that we can both exist in this environment. We both live to serve sneaker obsessed consumers and people that are driven by athletics and fitness and fashion.","And we bring a different formula to the table than a consumer that may be interested in a singular brand today, but may want a different brand tomorrow. So, obviously, we believe that that we can be profitable and successful working with our vendor partners to create great experiences, and localized and personalized experiences for our consumers.","And the aftermarket certainly is an important part of what it is that we do, right? I mean - but you can't have an aftermarket if you don't have the original market, right? So we see a lot of the things that are going on in the aftermarket. We stay very close to it and it's certainly an important part of keeping sneaker obsession relevant with these core consumers. The hype that it brings is certainly a positive for us.","Robert Drbul","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","John Maurer","All right, Dorothy, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Christopher Svezia with Wedbush.","Christopher Svezia","Thanks for taking my questions. So, first, I just want to go back to the thought process regarding the comp inflection that you expect for the second quarter. I guess there can you maybe just talk about what specifically from a product or category perspective do you see that that gives you that confident that you would see that inflection? Maybe certain categories that are difficult, yet, less bad, but just is it something in basketballs or vendors or product, is it in running?","Just what gives you that confidence to see that level of inflection? What do you see right now that gives you that confidence? That's my first question.","Richard Johnson","Chris, it's mostly around the depth of the product that we're starting to introduce right now. So if you think about the Air Max 270, if you think about VaporMax and VaporMax Plus, all very hot. When you think about a lot of the Jordan business getting a little bit better, certainly as they work hard to control the marketplace we're starting to see some positives there.","We got the Epic React from Nike that certainly is going to bring some more heat. You got Ultra Boost and certain NMD product from Adidas that will have the right amount of depth or better depth. Then you got the [Drocks Run] [ph] from Adidas that we hold high hopes for. So it's a combination of certain categories getting less bad.","As we see some things in basketball starting to have a little bit of resonance and we'll get some depth with those. And then, it really is depth around some of these products that are just starting to launch now or just making their way into the marketplace now.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. And then, with regard to Europe, is that just a function of just traffic or is there also a dynamic between certain types of products or brands that are creating a headwind that some of it to the U.S. but a greater order of magnitude in terms of depth, you're waiting for new product to hit? Just give us some reference or perspective and in terms of maybe when you can see that elements to your business start to show some level of improvement?","Richard Johnson","Well, there's a different vendor mix and different category mix there, right? Adidas has a bigger percentage of their business. Some of the things that we've talked about in the past slowing down and Adidas have had a much bigger impact there than necessarily North America where the brand heat is still growing.","But Adidas has done a great job with their Creators campaign and we're really starting to see some product turn. So there is some optimism there. I don't want to get into pointing specifically to when we believe there will be an inflection in Europe, as we really only guide the overall comp. But I think the team there is well aware of the challenges and as they shift their product mix and they shift their assortment, they're optimistic that the traffic will return.","So again, it's all factored into the comp that Lauren talked about in Q2 and then an increasing comp and improving comp in Qs 3 and 4.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. And a last question, Lauren, for you. Just when you think about the business model and maybe some of the changes that you're making, in the past you've always talked to you need I think low to maybe the high end of mid-single to lever the business. Maybe as you look at it today how is that changing or how is that evolving or any color you can give us about that, about that leverage point of the business?","Lauren Peters","Well, I mean, the mid-single-digit is still the right way to think about it and the product margin is a key component to that. All right, so that was our biggest hit to the rate in 2017. But we certainly think that with the investments that we're making in the business, things that we've got going on that digital side and that product depth, that those things come together to improve the rate performance.","Christopher Svezia","Okay. Thank you very much and all the best. I appreciate it.","Richard Johnson","Thanks, Chris.","John Maurer","All right, thank you all for participating on today's call. That's all we have time for today. Please join us on our next earnings call, which we anticipate will take place at 9:00 AM on Friday, May 25th, following the release of our first quarter results earlier that morning.","Jim and I will be at my desk shortly if we didn't get your question and to answer any follow-up questions you may have. In the meantime, thanks again and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Mr. Lance, you may begin.","James Lance","Thank you, Dorothy. And welcome everyone to Foot Locker Inc.\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. As reported in this morning\u2019s press release, the company reported net income of $165 million in the first quarter compared to $180 million in the first quarter of last year. ","On a GAAP basis, this year\u2019s net income was $1.38 per share compared to $1.36 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Included in these results is an incremental $12 million charge related to the pension litigation we have spoken about in the past. Excluding this item, on a non-GAAP basis, first quarter earnings were $1.45 per share, a 7% increase compared to $1.36 last year. Unless otherwise noted, the figures and rates mentioned during our call today will be based on non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in this morning\u2019s press release. ","We will begin our prepared remarks with Lauren Peters, Foot Locker\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide details on our first quarter financial results along with our financial outlook for the balance of the year. Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who then will review the key drivers of our first quarter performance along with a progress report on our 2018 real estate and digital initiatives. Lauren?","Lauren Peters","Thank you, Jim. Good morning to all of you. As you may recall, when we last spoke to you in March, we expected 2018 to start off challenge with comparable sales similar to or slightly worse than we experienced in the second half of 2017. I am pleased to report that while we faced many of the challenges we anticipated, a 2.8% comparable sales decline in the first quarter was an improvement over the second half of 2017. And there are encouraging signs as Dick and I will tell you about as we move through 2018.","Keeping to the first quarter for now, by month, February comparable sales were down high single-digits. March benefited from a shift in Easter and comp slightly positive, whereas April was negatively impacted by the shift and was down low-single digits. Total sales were up 1.2% with the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar contributing about $55 million to the top-line. ","Before we continue, I want to remind you that beginning this quarter, we are reviewing the business on the basis of integrated sales channels, both brick and mortar and digital. So, all of our commentary about our banners will be on an omnichannel basis. ","Moving on to the details of our results. There were some solid performances that stood out above the rest. Other areas where it will take some more time to improve our footings. Starting on a positive side of the ledger. Kids Foot Locker led our banners with a high-single digit comparable sales increase. Based on an improved availability of premium styles and kid sizes versus the year ago. Kids Foot Locker was followed by Foot Locker in the U.S. and East Bay both of which posted low-single digit comp gains. ","On the other side of the ledge, Foot Action, Champ Sports, Foot Locker Canada and Foot Locker Asia Pacific were each down mid-single digits. Foot Locker Europe posted a low-double digit comp decrease while Runners Point and Sidestep were both down double digits. ","Women's footwear was again adversely impacted by a lack of new on trend offering to offset last year's strong demand for Puma FENTY product and select Adidas silhouettes. The weaker footwear sales have the biggest impact of 602 which led to a double-digit comp decline for that banner. ","Breaking our comparable sales by channel. Our stores collectively posted a 3.1% decline, while comp sales at our direct-to-customer channel were essentially flat. As a percent of total sales, DTC was 13.9% for the quarter flat to last year. Overall store traffic was down low-single digits for the quarter with our U.S. banners experiencing stronger traffic than our international banners. By family of business, Footwear was down low-single digit. Apparel was an especially bright spot up double digits with gains across all genders, while accessories was down double digit due to weakness in socks, hats and insoles.","Within footwear, men's and kids' comparable sales were down low-single digits. While women's footwear declined low double digits. Average selling prices in footwear were up while units were down. In apparel, both ASP and units were up reflecting our customers' steadily increasing demand for our more premium assortment. ","Turning now to the balance of the income statement. Our gross margin came in at 32.9% in the first quarter, down 110 basis points from last year's 34%. The lower rate reflects a 60 basis points decline in our merchandize margin rates and a 50 basis points of deleverage of our occupancy and buyers' compensation. The lower merchandise rates were primarily the result of higher markdowns as we continue to proactively manage our inventory. We are in slower moving styles, while maintaining a strong inventory position in new and exciting products. Despite the higher markdowns our overall gross margin came in better than the guidance we provided on our last call, which reflects our customer\u2019s positive response to our improving position in more on trend styles, which Dick will be talking about in a moment. ","The progress in our margins was most evident in the U.S. Whereas I mentioned, Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker posted positive comp sales. However, we did feel some additional pressure from Foot Locker Europe, where our merchants had to rely on increased promotions to move through from slower selling styles. Our SG&A expense rate rose in the quarter by 50 basis points to 19% of sales with higher FX rate contributing 20 basis points of that increase. The further 30 basis points of deleverage was attributable to the significant investments we are making to our digital operations, as well as wage pressures and legal settlement costs partially offset by about $5 million of Hurricane Maria related insurance proceeds. ","Depreciation expense increased to $45 million from $41 million in the prior year. This expected increase reflects the investments we have made and continue to make to elevate the customer experience in our stores and across our various digital channels as well as improvements in our logistics network and other infrastructure related project. First quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 28%, 500 basis points lower than last year and close to our expectations. Noted on our last calls, the lower rate reflects the new 21% rate on our federal income taxes combined with the impact from state, local and foreign taxes.","Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.29 billion of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $20 million from the end of Q1 last year. During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $112 million and paid out $41 million through our quarterly dividend. We also invested $64 million of capital in our business, which includes the opening of new Champs Sports flagship store in Times Square. Overall, we remain on track to spend the planned $230 million of capital in 2018. We ended the quarter with 3,284 company-owned stores, down 26 from the beginning of the year. This includes the opening of 11 new stores remodeling or relocating 43 stores and closing 37 stores. ","We continue to proactively manage our inventory hosting a 5.4% decrease in the quarter, compared to 1.2% increase in total sales. Using constant currencies, inventory decreased 7.1%, compared to a 1.5% sales decrease. Our inventory discipline, which included the use of markdown leaves us well positioned to flow in fresh and exciting products throughout the balance of the year. In terms of our financial outlook for the remainder of 2018, we see the top line aligned with the guidance we provided on our prior call. Beginning with the second quarter, we still anticipate comparable sales to be flat to up slightly and we are still planning for a low single digit comparable sales increase in Q3 and Q4 strengthening within that low single digit range as we progressed through the year. ","For the full year, we still expect a flat to low single digit comp sales gain. Second quarter gross margin is likely to improve by about 20 to 50 basis points driven by improved product flow we expect merchandised margins to begin to recover in the second quarter along with less deleverage in our occupancy cost due to the shift of about $50 million of sales into Q2 related to the impact of last year\u2019s 53rd week.","We expect our Q2 SG&A expense rate to increase as a percent of sales by 110 to 140 basis points which reflects the increased digital investments I discussed which is still ramping up. Our incentive compensation expense is also higher this year versus 2017. As you may recall, in Q2 2017 we reduced our bonus accruals in line with our updated outlook. For the full year, we continue to believe we can achieve solid double-digit EPS growth over the $3.99 we earned in 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week basis.","Gross margin also on a non-GAAP 52-week basis, is now likely to improve 10 to 30 basis points. Compared to last year\u2019s 53-week growth margin rate, the range was plus 10 to minus 10 basis points. Our gross margin expectation reflects the improving performance in the US partially offset by the additional markdown pressure in Europe.","SG&A is still projected to delever by 100 basis points for the full year. As a reminder, we are modeling due to the 53rd week shift around $60 million of sales will shift out of Q3 at about $20 million will shift out of Q4. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Dick to cover the product highlight in more depth along with an update on our 2018 real estate and digital initiatives. Dick?","Dick Johnson","Thank you, Lauren. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As I noted during our last earnings call consumers want new experiences, they want cool product with connected storage and they wanted of pack. Now this may be due to disruptive to the retail industry it is served to reaffirm and accelerate our efforts around connecting with youth culture in more relevant and powerful ways. These efforts include the significant investments we are making to elevate the digital experience across our brands as well as the ongoing in our store fleet testing innovative off mall retail formats and leveraging our vendor partnerships to create truly differentiated retail destinations. Furthermore, we remain confident in our strengths and positioning at the premium end of athletically inspired footwear and apparel.","Taking a look at our first quarter comp performance through the product lens, men's footwear was down low single digits. This result was the combination of a growing running category, a somewhat improving but still down basketball category and a slight decrease in casual styles. Looking at these category results in depth, men's basketball was down low single digits as we are starting to see some of the benefits of Nike's tighter distribution of the Jordan brand across the marketplace along with improved full price sell through of Jordan Retros. As we have previously discussed the reduced allocations will continue to be top line headwinds over the next few quarters, but it will sequentially lessen as we progress through the year. While signature basketball was down overall, we continue to see strength in the Lebron business led by both the game shoe and the Soldier, additionally the PG posted healthy gains.","Running continued its momentum with a low single digit comp increase, where we saw an influx of new innovative platforms through Nike such as the Air Max 270, VaporMax 2.0 and the Epic React as well as the Explorer Endura from Adidas. We also experienced solid gains in Nike Tuned Air, which as many of you know is exclusive to Foot Locker Incorporated. Within our casual business which was down slightly, there was a lot of heat around Vans Classic styles and Fila Disruptor but this was offset by softness in select styles from Adidas, Puma and Converse. A clear bright spot in the quarter was apparel which continues to benefit from a shift to more premium assortments. The strength in our apparel business was relatively broad base with gains across most of our geographies, channels and genders. These strong results were led by branded assortments from Nike and Adidas as well as through resurgence of 90s influence brands like Champion and Fila.","In terms of our omni banner comp performance as Lauren mentioned, sales at Foot Locker in the U.S. were up low single digits. The positive results were fueled by the Nike Air Max platforms, Jordan Retro, Air Force Ones and Vans in footwear. Adidas, Nike NBA, Nike Tees and Jordan led the way in apparel. Given this performance, we are feeling good about how our league banners positioned for the remainder of the year. Another positive development was in our Kids Foot Locker banner which produced a high single digit comp gain. This was driven by strong double-digit gains in apparel and a mid-single digit increase in footwear. Kids Foot Locker benefited from many of the same trends that drove our men's business including strong Jordan Retro sell-throughs and the Air Max platforms.","In apparel Champion was the standout amongst several brands that performed very well. The primary drivers of these solid results in apparel include tees, fleece, shorts and infant sets. Champs Sports and Footaction were both down mid-single digits. Both banners benefited from strong performance styles from Nike including Max Air and the Air Force Ones. Conversely, both banners were impacted by difficult Jordan Retro comparisons. On a positive note, both banners posted strong high single digit comp gains in apparel.","Taking a look at Foot Locker Europe, sales were down low double-digits with footwear down low double-digits and apparel down low single-digits. As you may recall, Foot Locker Europe has historically experienced a higher penetration of Adidas than its US brothers. Furthermore, Adidas has been highly sought after over the past few years with Foot Locker Europe being the first to capture that increased demand. While Adidas is still a vibrant and exciting brand, the demand from our fast-moving consumer has come off that peak, which has led to a more promotional environment. Looking forward, Adidas has recently put some new listing to the marketplace like the Deerupt and we have seen some improving demand from this platform as we shifted into warmer weather. ","Foot Locker Europe also faced some headwinds in Puma, due in large part to the tough footwear comparisons against last year\u2019s platforms and baskets programs. In line with our US banners, Foot Locker Europe has also seen growing excitement from other brand offerings, including the various iterations of Nike Air Max, Vans and Fila. ","While we expect these new offerings will drive more full price selling, we still have some work to do in Europe near term in order to clear through some of the slower moving styles. We anticipate that the Foot Locker Europe business will progress in the back half of the year as we improve the depth of upcoming styles from Nike, Adidas, Champion, Vans and Fila just to name a few. ","Next, I want to update you on our 2018 real estate initiatives, which support our commitment to elevating the customer experience and enhancing our footprint across the globe. In the US, Champs Sports opened its newest flagship store at 10 Times Square in March. This multi-level space celebrates sneaker culture and brings an immersive retail experience, combining prominent digital elements that showcase the best brand stories from our leading vendor partners. ","Across some of our key geographies, we will begin testing Power Stores, a new retail concept to inspire, build community and provide a seamless shopping experience for our customer. This concept is all about community with a hyper local approach. We believe the design and programming of the space will provide inspiration to our customers through premium product and experiences presented in unexpected ways. The first of these test concepts will open during the second quarter in London and Liverpool with plans to expand the test in US market later this year. ","Our two European Power Stores will be delivering enhanced customer experiences and engagement through various initiatives. ","Lastly, we are excited to be expanding into Asia. In the third quarter, we plan to open our first Power Store in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Later in the year, three stores are slated to open in Singapore, along with one store opening in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. ","In terms of building out our digital capabilities, we are being pragmatic in our efforts to convert our websites to our new platform. Several sites have already been upgraded to the new platform with the others scheduled to come on later this year. The new platform will provide brand specific features and functionality and allow for future updates to be rolled out seamlessly across all of our banner platforms. ","We also recently launched a new mobile app for Kids Foot Locker. We are now working to launch or relaunch other banner apps within the next few months. There is also a lot of work underway regarding our new loyalty program, which will be focused on maximizing our portfolio of brands. We currently anticipate rolling out the new program in the U.S. later this year. Longer term, we believe the power of these digital initiatives will position us to become even more connected with our customers while engaging and creating increased loyalty with them and enhancing our top and bottom line performance in an always connected omni world. ","In terms of the outlook for the balance of the year, we believe the product flow and depth in key styles will continue to progressively strengthen. The Air Max platforms are prime example of the innovative product coming from Nike which is driving a lot of the excitement and demand across our banners. Additionally, we will have depth in key brands like Adidas, Vans, Champion, Fila and Balance not to match them some of the exclusive offerings that should resonate with our customers. It is the combination of our outstanding product pipeline and our continued strategic focus on elevating the customer experience that gives us confidence that we can deliver on the top-line and bottom line results, to which we have guided throughout the balance of the year. ","In closing, I want to thank our outstanding team of associates for their continued focus, passion and the energy around the business as we continue to build upon and strengthen our position centered on inspiring and empowering youth culture. ","Doherty, please open up the line for questions now. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. ","Camilo Lyon","Thanks, good morning guys. Dick, you've talked a lot about the product improving. And you clearly are making strides on working down the slower turning skews that\u2019s out. I'm wondering if you could just articulate how do you feel about the receipt that you have coming through the pipeline. If we should expect to see continued pressure on the product if you don't have on hand, but you expect to see and you talked about that a little bit happening in Europe, but how does the U.S. market look from that perspective?","Dick Johnson","Thanks for the question. We feel good about the product pipeline. As we've talked about in the fourth quarter and now on this call, the outlook of the product the things that are driving excitement, there is a breadth and it is combining with the depth that we've talked about earlier, that we feel good about the U.S. marketplace. We feel good about the European marketplace as well, but we do have some overhang there that we still have to clear through. So again, I think the strength of the product lies in the things that we mentioned earlier on the call and getting an increased depth across those key silhouettes.","Camilo Lyon","Great. And then my follow up question is for Lauren. Specifically, it relates to gross margin and your commentary around Q2 gross margin. You have clearly the easiest comparison in Q2 from last year. You're only looking for a fairly modest assumption of gross margin recovery. Could you just help us understand the puts and takes around that especially given the incremental benefit on the top-line from the $50 million of the shift in the weeks. Which is I would have thought that they would been a little bit strong over gross margin recovery in the second quarter?","Lauren Peters","No. I think it\u2019s relates to what just took us to around the product puts and takes by geography. So, we\u2019ve got disability in to how that product flows across the period and we factor all of that into that guidance. ","Camilo Lyon","And then just finally for me, just on the digital platform you spoke about, new platforms coming online later this year. Any sense as to which platforms you expect and the timing of those launches?","Dick Johnson","We\u2019re moving all of our websites, our digital sites to a common platform. We\u2019ve been on a legacy platform in to this project that we\u2019ve been working on. We\u2019ve been very pragmatic about moving the sites over to the new platform and making sure that it functions and does everything that we expect it to. So that will continue throughout this year. Well then have everybody on the common platform, the newer platform and that will allow us to make subsequent changes more effectively and efficiently across the coming platforms. So again, some of the banners have already moved over, other banners are in progress as we speak today and some of them will be a little bit later in the year. ","Camilo Lyon","So, customer facing changes won\u2019t happen until next year. Is that the right way to think about it?","Dick Johnson","Some of the customer facing changes are happening as we speak, right. Ideally, it's a listing shift over to the new platform. But we\u2019re adding functionality, we\u2019re adding some look and feel differences that KFL that I mentioned this brand new. So, there is constantly both legacy backend things that are being updated as well as the customer facing front end.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Svezia with Wedbush.","Christopher Svezia ","I guess, first just look back on the gross margin, specifically Lauren for you. The 20 to 50 basis points improvement in Q2, maybe more specifically how much of that is actually merchandise margin improvement? You mentioned an inflection, that you're expecting that to actually turn positive. And I think for the year, I mean on the last call, you called out 30 to 40 basis points in total for the year. I think here you said 10 to 30 and then something about the 50, on a 52 and 53-week basis. Maybe a bit of a clarity about that on the annual, maybe why it\u2019s a little bit different than before?","Lauren Peters","Okay. Why don\u2019t I take it again through the full year guidance? Because models, we want to make sure that you are understanding 52-week non-GAAP versus 53 depending upon how your model works. So, on a 52-week basis full year, we\u2019re looking for 10 to 30 basis points of improvements. If you\u2019re doing your modeling off of a full 53-week last year, it looks like a range of plus 10, minus 10 around that foothold last year. And so that would intend to give you some clarity. ","Christopher Svezia ","And the second quarter between merchandise margin and occupancy cost? ","Lauren Peters","I don\u2019t want to parse that out but we are thinking through that as we obviously get a little bit leverage out of that topline shift impact and we\u2019ve got this situation with the merged margins of improving US full price sale through, we\u2019ve got challenges in the international as we work through our slower-moving styles. ","Dick Johnson","And just a reminder, in Europe most of the sale period falls in the second quarter so from a mark down perspective it\u2019s an opportunity for us to push some of the slower moving products so we can get them into a fresher inventory position. ","Christopher Svezia ","Okay. And just on Western Europe I know in the second quarter I think you are up against negative high single and then it turns to negative low double digits for the back half of the year from a comp perspective. Where comp by region or geographic region but would you anticipate at all significantly now in the GAAP you seen a turn to positive in North America which is encouraging for Foot Locker but maybe give us some timeline or thought process as to how we think about where that inflection can take place maybe in Western Europe and is it just strictly products driven at this point?","Dick Johnson","As I talked about in our remarks the we see the Western Europe business progressing through the back half of the year and there are some headwinds against some of the slower moving products that we have to get through the flow of new innovative products and in depth that we talked about is improving in the back half. I\u2019m not going to call out a specific inflection point other than to say that we do see it getting better in the back half of the year. ","Christopher Svezia ","Okay, final question just on apparel. We had good momentum in apparel, it seems like it's accelerating a little bit here just sort of your thoughts about how you think about for the balance of the year relative to the kind of flat to low single digit comp for the total company. ","Dick Johnson","Our apparel I think this is seven quarters in a row that we\u2019ve had comp positive gains in apparels. So, our apparel team has done a really, really go job in terms of turning the inventory and giving it fresh with the consumers. So, there is a tremendous buzz around some of this 90s influence so Champions has been out in a great run, Fila has been on a great run, we expect that to continue and as we work with those vendor partners to get increased depth so that we can cover a broader store base we feel good about our apparel business in the back half and it had a great first quarter and as the inventory I know the inventory is in great shape. So, we have some time for the apparel in the back half. ","That\u2019s offset by a continuing weakness in our accessories business and we usually lump those together in a lot of cases and we\u2019re continuing to trying to get the sack business right sized. Headwear's become less important to our customer. So, we\u2019ve got to keep that in balance but feel good about the actual apparel side of the business. ","Christopher Svezia ","Okay, sounds good. Thank you and all the best. ","Dick Johnson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird. ","Jonathan Komp","Yeah, hi thank you. Lauren I was hoping that maybe first just to clarify on the gross margin guidance for the year you gave kind of that two different ways. Did that change versus the prior view and I\u2019m just wondering, I know you over delivered in Q1 and it sounds like a lot of US is improving. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand any moving parts there?","Lauren Peters","Yes, it does reflect an update when we gave our guidance in March, really looking to 40 basis points to 60 basis points. Yeah, we didn\u2019t call out at that point 53 versus 52. Hence our desire to make sure that you understood with that additional week last year, how we were thinking about it, GAAP and non-GAAP about the 53rd week.","Jonathan Komp","Okay, great. Thank you for clarifying. And then a bigger picture question going back to looking at trends in Europe versus the U.S. and I guess maybe a little different question, but I'm wondering how much of the divergence is, a sign that some of what's starting to work in the U.S. is working or not over there versus some of the issues that you're facing in Europe, getting worse, I'm wondering if you can give me more clarity on where you're seeing it, specifically I\u2019m wondering if the new Nike product where you're getting more depths that expect to is, is having any varying degrees of success here versus in Europe?","Dick Johnson","Well, the consumer these days Jonathan that once they see if they want it. So, the things that are working here are beginning to work in Europe as well. The difficulty that Western Europe faces is that they have a historically had a much bigger penetration of Adidas products, they were the first to catch that wave on the way up, the road is hard, you got to be a big part of the business. And as certain silhouettes have slowdown, they\u2019re facing some headwinds from it and as they reposition, some of that product as they get the right amount of Nike receipts that's why I have some confidence that it will get somewhat better in the back half, but again the things that work generally speaking work all over, if we have access to it, you have to remember that assortments vary by geographies from our vendor partners as well.","Jonathan Komp","Okay, great. And maybe one other question as you look at the pipeline coming out. Would you characterize it more as broadening depths of what we currently see in the marketplace in terms of the new styles or are you expecting more new releases that are obviously that you\u2019ve had in the marketplace and I guess that's a global question kind of across brands what you're seeing?","Dick Johnson","It\u2019s combination of both, Jonathan, right, I mean we\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of calls but we see the depth of key styles, increasing as we get to the back half of the year, so whether that be scaling VaporMax, celebrating the 20th anniversary of Tuned Air, some really exciting things that we see going on, it maybe new color ways, it maybe new compilations of materials on the upper and that may be new silhouettes but we feel good about the product heat from a lot of our key vendors, lot of our top vendors.","Jonathan Komp","Okay, great. Thank you","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Nikic with Wells Fargo.","Tom Nikic","Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, Lauren, I believe you said that the DTC comps were only flat in the quarter, I guess was a little bit surprise even late last year when you\u2019re comping worse overall, you still sort of had positive DTC comps, I was kind of wondering, what exactly happened there?","Dick Johnson","Well, I'll take the question, Tom. A lot of things that impacted, certainly the stores impacted even to a greater degree than the digital business. So, some of the pullback in the Jordan brand, had a huge impact to our digital business because we sold and sell a lot of launch product through the digital sites. And while they may not have sold out day of the year ago, we have a long tail that we were able to sell online. So, as we saw some of the allocations, difficult back, but it certainly had a disproportionate impact on our digital business. ","As we look to move through some of the slower-moving silhouettes, where we're very channel agnostic with that and try to leverage the power of the digital business. So, we were fairly aggressive in situations in terms of moving through some of those -- the markdown products. So, while you get some impact, you don\u2019t get the same top-lines if you were selling full priced products. So, there is -- structurally the team has done a great job of taking on the omni-channel work. Our GMs are responsible for their brands now in their entirety and are very channel agnostic. So, it\u2019s about driving excitement with the consumer. So, we see that accelerating as we get through some of the allocation challenges and we get through some of this markdown issues. ","Lauren Peters","And we get some of the benefit from the investments that we are making in the capabilities. ","Dick Johnson","Absolutely. ","Tom Nikic","And just a quick follow up on real estate. I think on the Q4 call you called for 40 openings, up to 10 closures this year, and we still sort of think that that\u2019s the general framework. Just bigger picture, I mean you\u2019ve been a long-term net closer of stores in the US I think something like 11 years in a row, do you have any sense as to sort of how long that continues, what your sort of ultimate store opening looks like, anything like that would be helpful?","Dick Johnson","Well the anticipation is we will probably have the opportunity to close a few more stores than we guided to originally. I would tell you we\u2019d likely be in the 120 plus sort of range. We look for opportunistic times to close those stores and some of its mall demise, some of it\u2019s our choice to move. The openings will be about where we talked about around the 40 mark. And over time this concept of Power Stores bigger square footage really locally connected to the community will sort of alter the portfolio a bit. So, I am really excited to get a chance to test these out in London and in Liverpool and then in the US market later this year. So, we will see a continued management of the portfolio. And we look at it long-term. Our real estate team and our lease team has done a great job of building flexibility in. So, we have the opportunity to extract some lower rents in some cases and to build flexibility into our ability to get out of some of the stores that we need to get out of. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Poser from Susquehanna.","Sam Poser","First of all, on loyalty program, you talked about a change there. Can you give us some details as to what that is?","Richard Johnson","Sorry Sam not ready to give any details yet other than to tell you that we are completely reimagining our loyalty program and it will leverage the power of our portfolio as we think about loyalty in the future. But not ready to talk about it in detail yet. ","Sam Poser","I mean to just follow real quick, if that implied the Champs loyalty program will be intertwined with Foot Locker loyalty program. Is that the good way to think about it?","Dick Johnson","That's certainly one scenario that you could think about it in. The portfolio is a powerful, powerful thing with all of the digital sites and the brands that we got. And we'll have more to talk about later this year. ","Lauren Peters","Our customers are really enamored as this category look to our different brands for different shopping indication. You know that they do cross brand shopping. And we want to make sure that we're recognizing and reporting that. ","Sam Poser","Thank you. And then secondly, I mean, could you talk a little bit about Nike, Adidas and others have talked about the flow of their product and how they're going in the shorter time frame. With what you see? How are you -- I guess are you buying product with for less weeks of supply so you can move from one thing to the other more in step with how quickly many of your core customers are evolving their pace I guess. ","Dick Johnson","We're certainly trying to adapt to way our consumer moves and the way that our vendors move product into the marketplace. There are some things that you continue to buy very much the way that you've always brought a White Air Force One for example, which you have great marketability and is very consistent. There is a pattern with how we buy that. When you think about some of the excitement that comes in and pops and then goes away quickly, we do buy as aggressively as we can but we know that we're going to be out of that. We've talked for long time about how the peak of product receptivity of our consumers is much, much faster from the old days of seed to scale. We need to go see the scale quicker and we're working with our vendor partners to do that. Ultimately you have across the assortments and we have fewer weeks of coverage so that you can get into the next thing quicker. ","Sam Poser","Thank you. And then lastly, it looks as if based on your guidance and based on your inventory levels and the accordance accounts payable. It looks like your accounts payable is up disproportionately. Does that mean that a lot of the change a lot of the influx of the new product really showed up right towards the end of the quarter? And that due products what's gives you confidence of the improvement in same store sales relative to the old stuff that you were working on clearing. I realized just are still clearing goods in Europe. But is that sort of generally the right way to think about that?","Lauren Peters","There was some impact of products flow and again with a 53rd week shift or a little bit of that too. But the bigger impact on that '18 number was that a year they would have been more credit for RTVs in that number reducing the APs and -- this year. So that's the bigger difference. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Citi. ","Kate McShane","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to check in on a couple of tests that you're running. I think last quarter, you've told us about a test in 9 stores that you're looking at with athletes and then also the power stores that you mentioned on this call. Just wondering what the expectations are for this cash been. Will it be something that replaces current formats and will it be lower off mall?","Dick Johnson","We continue to work with Nike and bringing Nike athletes in and working on the in-store experience with Nike and our other vendor partners. So, we\u2019ve seen positive results, we continue to expand that out a bit. And obviously for our core consumer today, it\u2019s all about the in-store experience. So, power stores that we\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times will provide us an opportunity in some cases to pivot off mall, right. It\u2019s the locations, where we know that the customer is there. We want to provide great excitement in the store and we haven\u2019t been able to necessarily get the right flexibility in the malls, so the malls happen to be going away. ","So, it could be strip mall, it could be a power mall, it could be off the pad. But it will allow us the opportunity to do more on the street if you will. Of course, in Western Europe, we\u2019ve got about half of our fleet at high street base. So, it\u2019s not a truly new concept for us to be off mall or on the high street but taking some bigger spaces and creating experiential sort of retail is where we\u2019re really talking this power store concept.","Kate McShane","And then my second question is on women\u2019s footwear. I just wondered in terms of the guidance, the overall comp guidance what your views on any improvement within women\u2019s footwear for the year?","Dick Johnson","Well, we feel better about women's going into the back half space. Some of the miss on the women's side is really very, very high-level launch specific from last year. The fancy product from Puma last year, the Rihanna product was phenomenal. And they\u2019re just as nothing, there is replacing in the marketplace right now. But that exposure goes down as we get later in the year and with some of the great Max Air platforms that are coming with some of the Adidas product that\u2019s coming, she is very much into Vans these days. So, we feel very good about the women\u2019s footwear business getting better in the back half. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy with Buckingham Research.","Eric Tracy","I guess Dick for you. Just a little bit bigger picture as you think about exclusivity. And exclusives here in in-store or digital in this ever-evolving sort of landscape. You\u2019re confidence around Foot Locker participating be it basketball or running. Just around the lost schedule. We\u2019ve seen, not only the brands going direct, but using social media platforms now some exclusives. Just big picture wanted to talk through your confidence level and Foot Locker maintaining is not increasing on the exclusive side?","Dick Johnson","Well, we know that\u2019s what motivates are consumer Eric, right. They want what\u2019s cool, they won\u2019t what we\u2019re able to work on with our vendor partners. There is a lot of collabs that are out there, that, there is not always a ton of product available, but they drive a tremendous amount of heap. And our team is focused and working with our vendor partners to continue to create exclusives and it's not shop a lot of different ways right I mean a kind will response to a great colorway but it's really more about creating a concept around the product, it's about engaging that -- connecting that product with an engaging stories that our customers understands and then driving that to a scalable model and that I think is really the key that for us you know we\u2019ve had a lot of customers that shop a lot of different ways and we have to work with our vendor partners to bring this heat to a scalable level. And that\u2019s the work that goes on, our team spends an awful lot of time with vendor partners to get that accomplished. But we do believe that that exclusivity and unique connectivity sometimes it's very hyper local things that we want to do but our team is absolutely focused on that. ","Lauren Peters","That\u2019s really a competitive advantage of ours because we can\u2019t beat a strategic partner to our suppliers on developing this unique product and doing it at a scale that makes sense for them to produce it forth. ","Eric Tracy","Yeah, and then just shifting a little bit more in for years, we think about SG&A certainly depreciate, if comps inflect positively fixed cost leverage but as you think about the investments behind digital as we move though the year and even bigger than next year just the opportunity to better leverage and or you know moderation of some of that spend?","Dick Johnson","Yeah, well this customer is connected 24x7 so I\u2019m making sure that our digital offering is complimentary to that bench of there is a very, very important hence the investment. But you know it's certainly as you\u2019ve seen when we look back at our history we are very responsible stewards of the expense and when we get to comp positive, we can really lever that topline results. ","Eric Tracy","Okay. Thank you all, best of luck. ","Dick Johnson","Thanks Eric. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erin Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Eric Johnson","Hi guys it's Eric for Erin and thanks for taking our question. I just want to ask around digital priorities in terms of what you\u2019ve been most impactful in your view for your key customers whether that\u2019s -- and how do you prioritize between shipping speed, web interface, checkout speed, supply chain systems, free shipping threshold. What are your biggest focus areas that have kind of investments that you guys are taking on this year?","Dick Johnson","Well we\u2019re tracking on it all quite honestly, the consumer really won\u2019t let us sort of peace meal without, so we\u2019re doing some really heavy lifting around the foundational work that\u2019s going to be done, so the pipes have to be made bigger, the plumbings got to be in place and we\u2019re doing all that and we\u2019re improving our apps and we\u2019re building the digital business a direct to consumer business for 20 plus years. So, we understand free shipping thresholds and we understand what free shipping does to the model our financial model the model is different for some pure plays. We have great experiences in stores, so being able to leverage the store business with the digital business is one of the competitive advantages that we bring along consumers to pick products up in the store making all of our inventory readily available to wherever the consumer happens to be browsing and shopping and engaging with us. So, we\u2019ve got work streams behind it all and it will mature at different levels, the platform work as I said is in progress today with the platform -- with some of our sites already on the new platform, the digital work from an apps perspective, the team is doing some really heavy lifting there as well. So, it's all really interconnected.","Eric Johnson","Great, thanks. And then just one more on, it looks like, rent expense was up almost $50 million year-on-year last year, I\u2019m just curious how much of that was sort of dark rent for new headquarter or new flagships and what is the kind of underlying core kind of rent run rate we should be thinking about and is there any opportunity for reductions or getting more aggressive on that line?","Lauren Peters","I think you hit on it, in regard to that some of the bigger properties that we've invested and we\u2019ve had some flagship openings over the recent period. The dynamics of accounting for the rent is on a straight-line basis, so it\u2019s moves that over the period of the lease. All right. So that\u2019s been part of that dynamic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","So, the first quarter showed good execution and progress from the second half of \u201917, just want to push you guys a little bit, going from 1Q, there\u2019s still a negative comp to the second quarter guidance, there\u2019s still a little bit of a leap forward as we now have our eye set on positive comps. So, could you just give us a little bit maybe more clarity or color around what is driving that sequential progression, for example, how should we think about the Europe business and the ability to show any improvement quarter-over-quarter, has the U.S. store business already showcased an acceleration quarter-to-date, is there any expectation of the Jordan headwinds to alleviate or is this all about additional SKUs of 270s another innovation, just looking for clarity there. Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Well, we hit on a lot of it, Paul. I think it\u2019s clear that we're improving in the big foot banner in the U.S. that we talked about, right. We don't give quarter-to-date guidance. So, I\u2019m not going to go there, but as I think Lauren mentioned in her commentary that reaffirmed in mind, we're seeing some real progress in North America. So, there is certainly a bit of headwind around the Jordan allocation numbers, but we\u2019re seeing better sell throughs and nobody does, market allocation better than that brand and they is doing what's right for the market place. So, we see that improving in the back half.","The depth of the SKUs, some of SKUs that you mentioned whether it be 270s, whether it be selling VaporMax access to better quantities and some of the apparel brands that we mentioned from Champion and Fila, our relationship with Vans continues to improve. So, there's more depth coming across key and that\u2019s really what we see power in the U.S. The same things will be going on in Western Europe. The issue with Western Europe is a little bit of the overhang that they\u2019ve got from getting through some of the slower moving silhouettes. They go into their sale period across many of the countries in the second quarter which they'll be able to take advantage of and move through some of that product, that\u2019s why I see it getting better in the back half. So absolutely we feel that the sequential improvement based on the things that we have talked about, based on some of the things that you called out, we definitely see as very possible in the back half.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And then just quick follow ups, just what is the ASP outlook for the balance of the year and what was it in the first quarter? And then also obviously the apparel business is doing well, if you can just discuss the margin profile of that business today?","Richard Johnson","Well ASPs were up in Q1. We continue to see the ability especially at this premium apparel and footwear mix that we\u2019ve got for ASPs to continue to improve throughout the year. Some of that really is being driven by the apparel business that you called out. As we up our assortments and we sell more premium apparel, that certainly has a very positive impact on our overall ASPs. We still do some private label business which is also beneficial for a lot of our customers but we have seen our customers migrating to a much more premium apparel position. As we get through some of this markdown pressure, it also is additive to the ASP calculation. So, we see that as being positive and we see ASPs able to grow throughout the year. ","From a margin perspective, we are certainly seeing margin improvement on the apparel front. I think that\u2019s -- we have been talking about it for a long time. We want the apparel margins to get ahead of footwear. We are getting closer but we are not there yet but definitely moving in the right direction Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. ","Michael Binetti","Continuing on Paul\u2019s question on the composition of the footwear comps, is that interesting to look back at your commentary on ASPs and how it\u2019s positive, I think all of last year has moved through much high clear sell rolls and negative total comps, you said that ASPs were higher this quarter and units were lower again. But can you talk us through that, is that intuitive to that ASPs remained positive last year and do you think there\u2019s a path back to positive units as you build towards the positive sales growth in the back half?","Richard Johnson","Well ASPs we\u2019ve talked about it many times, Michael, it\u2019s a pretty complex calculation, right. I mean we have a lot of things going on across a lot of categories. So, the price of T-shirts going up, going from X for Y sort of offer to $25 $35 each sort of T-shirts. Premium fleas certainly drives things up. Is it intuitive that even during the markdown period ASPs went up? Not completely intuitive but again I think that shows you some of the complexity of the ASP model. So certainly, as we see traffic improvements, as we see our ability to utilize our digital sites better, I\u2019d love to see units go up as well. That certainly is an objective. But we can be successful with this accelerating ASP growth in everything that we do on, the increase on the unit side of things, should just be incremental positives. ","Michael Binetti","And then could you just -- I know we beat up Europe up a little bit, but maybe I could ask it a little bit in different way. Can you speak to I guess the slow-moving inventory in Europe? Lauren, it looks like you ratcheted down the gross margin for the year. I'm looking at about roughly 30 basis points. If you saw something in first quarter that didn't away side in Europe. Can you help us understand it sounds like from Dick's comments, that there is going to be a big focus on promotion in the second quarter and then it clears out? Is that really -- you saw in the first quarter the product we had in stores was not working and we're going rip the band aid off so quickly as you through most of that merchandize inventories in Europe and through the much cleaner position into the second half as well?","Lauren Peters","So, Michael thank you for asking one more time at the gross margin for the full year as you gave me the opportunity to correct to myself. When we gave the guidance in March for the full year it was 30 to 40 basis points. And we updated it on a 52-week basis now to 10 to 30. So that gives you a feel for the incremental difference that we're talking about. And yes, we've got to deal with the inventory in Europe and taking advantage as Dick described of the sale period that happened here in Q2 a great opportunity to do that. So, as we see the flow of product and getting the breadth and depth into the stuff that the customers responding to both in the U.S. and Europe that's why we're encouraged in the back half of the situation will look a little different and be improved.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John A. Maurer","Thank you, Dawn. Good morning. Thank you very much for joining us today to discuss Foot Locker, Inc.'s results for the second quarter of 2014. In this morning's press release, we reported an increase in second quarter net income to $92 million or $0.63 per share on a GAAP basis. This EPS figure represents a 43% increase over our second quarter earnings in 2013 of $0.44 per share. Year-to-date, our net income has reached $254 million or $1.73 per share on a GAAP basis, an increase of 25% over net income in the comparable 6-month period last year.","As noted in our release, we incurred an impairment charge of approximately $2 million pretax related to the CCS trade name as we transitioned our online skate business to Eastbay. Excluding this one-time expense, second quarter non-GAAP EPS was a $0.01 higher at $0.64, a 39% increase over the $0.46 per share we earned on a non-GAAP basis last year.","A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release, and except as noted otherwise, the numbers mentioned during our remarks today will be based on the non-GAAP results.","Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will start us off this morning with a summary of our second quarter and year-to-date financial results. Dick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will provide additional insight into the business drivers in the quarter. And finally, Ken Hicks, Chairman and CEO, will highlight our progress on several of the key initiatives leading us on the path towards achieving our current long-term objectives. After Ken's prepared remarks, we will open up the call for you to ask questions.","So let's jump right in. Lauren, shall we?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, John, let's. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. I am very pleased to share with you the details of how we achieved the excellent overall results that John just highlighted. We had strong top line growth, as well as very strong performance in gross margin, SG&A and the balance sheet.","Our quarterly comparable sales gain of 7% is a clear indication that the momentum we have felt in our business in recent years has continued so far into 2014, and it's helped propel our financial results to new record highs. With the strength of a full quarter of Runners Point Group sales, our overall top line increased 12.9% compared to the second quarter of 2013. Recall that last year, RPG sales were included only for the month of July.","Comparable sales increased high single digits in May, mid-single digits in June and in July, were strong mid-single digits. By segment, our athletic store sales were up 6.1%, while sales in our direct-to-customer segment increased 14.9%. We believe these results demonstrate the importance of having a strong and consistent focus across all channels of distribution, since our customer expects a fresh and exciting store environment and an engaging and flexible digital experience.","Within our store divisions, we drove low double-digit comparable sales gains in both our U.S. Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker stores. Our next strongest store banner, I'm pleased to report, was Lady Foot Locker, with a gain in the high-mid-single digits. Dick will address Lady Foot Locker's progress during his remarks.","Our international divisions of Footaction were each up in the mid-single-digit range. Foot Locker Europe, in fact, posted a comparable store sales gain in all 19 countries in which it operates.","In addition, the Runners Point and Sidestep banners both posted strong mid-single-digit comparable sales gains, although recall that their comps will not be included in our consolidated comp numbers until October.","Foot Locker Canada's mid-single-digit gain this quarter was a nice improvement from the sales decline that posted in the first quarter when winter seemed unwilling to loosen its grip.","And although it is our smallest division by store count, our Foot Locker Asia Pacific team has done a terrific job driving both top line results and our bottom line productivity, which is now among the highest in our company. The only store division which did not post a comparable sales gain was Champs Sports, which missed by less than 1%. The biggest challenge at Champs was in apparel and accessories, which is a bigger percentage of their business than it is in our other divisions.","Within our direct-to-customer segment, our U.S. store banner.com business continues to be our fastest-growing business, with sales increasing at close to a 40% clip. Eastbay was up low-single digits in the quarter, while CCS was down low-single digits. The transition of our skate business from the CCS banner to Eastbay is proceeding in line with our plans and should be complete this fall.","With the growth in top line sales, our gross margin improved at a very strong 80 basis points to 32%. The gain was driven primarily by operating leverage on our relatively fixed occupancy and volume costs. We improved our markdown rates in the quarter to offset ongoing pressure from lower initial market rates and lower shipping and handling income, leaving our merchandise margin flat to last year.","Our expense management and store operations team did an exceptional job in the quarter, with our SG&A rate decreasing 70 basis points to 20.9%. Some of the improvement from last year's second quarter rate was due to enhancing store associate productivity through enhanced training, as well as utilization of hiring and scheduling tools being implemented in the last several quarters.","We also took a disciplined pay-as-you-go approach to marketing expenses, which in Q2 actually came in below last year. However, due to the timing of certain back-to-school campaigns, some of the marketing expense dollars are shifting from Q2 into Q3.","Depreciation expense increased to $36 million, an increase of $5 million compared to last year. This increase reflects the incremental investments we are making in our store fleet, our digital businesses and technology to drive efficiencies in our operation, as well as the addition of RPG to our asset base.","Our tax rate came in very close to our expectations at 36.3%. Our rate was 140 basis points lower than last year's second quarter rate when tax expense was pressured up by an additional state tax provision and Runners Point acquisition costs, which were not tax deductible.","The overall result was net income on a non-GAAP basis of $93 million or $0.64 per share, an excellent 35% increase over last year. We are proud to expect yet another record for our quarterly and year-to-date earnings results.","We also had a very strong inventory performance, as we posted an increase of just 2% compared to a total sales increase of almost 13%. We are working hard to improve our inventory turns, and we are making good progress, especially in footwear. This inventory discipline enables us to keep solid flow of fresh receipts coming into the business, and we feel our inventory is well positioned for the back-to-school and fall seasons.","We had strong cash flow during the quarter and in a period with a cash balance of $957 million. This performance has enabled us to continue investing in the business as we track towards our annual plan of $220 million in capital expenditures.","We returned $98 million to our shareholders in the quarter through our $0.22 dividend, which we increased by 10% at the beginning of this year and the repurchase of 1.33 million shares of our common stock for $66 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $136 million of our stock, reducing outstanding shares by almost 2.9 million. In total, we have returned $200 million of cash to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs so far this year.","Turning to a brief real estate summary. We ended the second quarter with 3,460 company-operated stores, a decrease of 4 from the end of the first quarter. We are still on track to close just over 100 stores this year, although some of the closures have been pushed back into the second half of the year. We are currently projecting to open approximately 80 stores this year, mostly in Europe and Kids Foot Locker, up from our initial projection of about 60.","I will finish by updating our guidance for the balance of the year: Mid-single-digit comparable sales gains, 20 to 40 basis points of leverage gains in gross margin, 30 to 50 basis points of SG&A rate improvement, and a double-digit increase in EPS. We performed even better than that in Q2, as we're off to a solid top line start to back-to-school, with a high-single-digit comparable sales gain so far in August.","However, I have mentioned a few timing factors, such as the final liquidation of CCS merchandise this fall, marketing expenses that shifted into Q3 and additional store closing expenses, which will lead -- which will yield more leverage opportunity in the fourth quarter than the third.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Dick to review the merchandise highlights in the quarter.","Richard A. Johnson","Thanks, Lauren. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my thanks to everyone on the team at Foot Locker, Inc. It was an outstanding team effort that led to the results Lauren just detailed.","I'll start my remarks with our families of business. Footwear was once again our strongest area, with a comp gain in the high-single digits, while apparel and accessories were down mid-single digits. Within footwear, basketball continued to be the leader, with a gain in the teens. We had good strength in our running business as well, which is -- was also up in the teens with very strong double-digit growth internationally, where running is our biggest category, and mid-single-digit growth in the U.S.","In basketball, and I know I'm starting to sound like a broken record on these calls, but Jordan continues to be the strongest area of the category, which fortunately has many others strengths as well. Jordan was strong across all its components. The Jordan player shoes, including CP and Melo, had solid sell-throughs, as did some of the classic off-court styles, such as the True Flight and the Flight Future. And of course, the Jordan Retro releases continue to drive sales and traffic into our stores.","Our key player shoes were another bright spot in basketball, with gains in Lebron, Kobe and KD. While traditional mid- and high-top silhouettes were strong, some of the strength in basketball also relates to the proliferation of low-cut styles within all of those player franchises.","These shoes are categorized as basketball, although a year ago, the same customer may have been buying a running shoe, since he's not necessarily buying the shoes to play basketball or run in. It's also about the look. In fact, I think John here, with this Kobe Phenomenons, is leading that fashion trend.","Turning to running. Max Air from Nike, with models such as the Max 90, the Thea for women and Finger Trap Max, was a consistent winner across our banners and geographies. The Roshe Run has also become a global success, producing significant gains in dollars and units. The ZX Flux from adidas was certainly a popular choice in running, especially in Europe, but also in the U.S. where we expect it to continue to build. We're also seeing gains out of New Balance, particularly in the 574 program. Within lifestyle footwear, the Air Force 1 franchise continues to perform well, as do classic styles in PUMA and Vans.","Switching over to apparel. Our U.S. Locker division, which includes Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker and Footaction, generated a comparable sales gain in the mid-single digits. The improvement was led by branded tank tops, t-shirts, shorts and hats that all coordinated with footwear. Socks continue to sell well, especially Nike multipacks, stamps and NBA socks, which are offsetting a slowdown in Elite Socks.","The areas of the biggest apparel challenge were Foot Locker Europe, with a double-digit decline; and Champs Sports, which was down mid-single digits. Both divisions were impacted by a fashion shift away from certain programs that had helped drive their results in the past, and both divisions are working diligently to adjust their apparel assortments and work with our key vendors to revitalize and refresh programs that we believe will resonate with our customers in the future.","In the case of Foot Locker Europe, that division successfully drove a strong double-digit footwear gain to produce the solid mid-single-digit overall comp gain that Lauren mentioned.","Champs Sports, on the other hand, had strong footwear sales in the quarter. But with apparel being a more important component of their total merchandise assortment, it wasn't sufficient to produce an overall comp gain. That said, Champs Sports remains a very productive chain and a strong profit producer for our company.","We've had a great deal of success differentiating our banners over the past few years. Champs has been a leader in that effort and has had many quarters of double-digit comp gains during that time. With additional remodels, which are outperforming the balance of the chain, enhanced vendor partnerships and select assortment and presentation changes, we believe that we have the capability for Champs Sports to get back to be a strong contributor to our comp growth and increase its profits to even higher levels.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to conclude my remarks by touching on our women's business. We are all very pleased to be reporting the high-mid-single-digit comp gain that the Lady Foot Locker chain, which includes our 9 SIX -- at the Lady Foot Locker chain, which includes the 9 SIX:02 doors.","Our women's business, in fact, was up in most of the banners we sell in this product. Within the Lady Foot Locker division itself, footwear was up mid-singles, while apparel was up in the teens.","In short, the customers are finding us. They like the new performance-oriented assortments we offer in both SIX:02 and most Lady Foot Locker stores, and we're clearly on the right track. We're encouraged enough by our test results so far and the comp trends to expand our tests and remodels to drive the turnaround in this business. However, we still need a bit more time to finalize the model before we commit to a large-scale rollout plan.","We'll be sure to keep you updated as our plans solidify over the coming months. Anything you'd like to add on the women's business, Ken?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, Dick, I would. But first, let me add my thanks to all our associates for producing the outstanding results we're privileged to be reporting today, and let me also thank all of you who are participating on the call this morning. I really appreciate the confidence and support you all give us, whether it's in analyzing and writing about the Foot Locker story or investing directly in our company. Thank you all very much.","In terms of our women's business, I recently described the status as being in a green fuzz stage. When you plant a lawn, you go from seeing a barren-looking patch of ground, which is that discomfort thing that happens when you fire your previous customers, to seeing a few green shoots, which is what happens when your new target customer first starts to find your new assortment.","At the green fuzz stage, you can finally begin to see that you're actually going to get a full lawn, but you have to keep watering and fertilizing it diligently to make it healthy and sustainable. We can't let the football team run around on it quite yet.","The comp gain we achieved at Lady Foot Locker in the second quarter was a beautiful thing and was especially gratifying for the team that's been working so hard to make our women's business a success we believe it will be. However, we're still in the nurture and development stage, and the team is doing a great job. I give them all the credit in the world.","Turning to the overall business, as Lauren and Dick have described, the momentum we've built remains intact. We've achieved 18 consecutive quarters of meaningful sales and profit growth, and the team continues to set records in the key financial and operating metrics we track.","The even better news is that we continue to have multiple opportunities to improve our business even further. We have many strengths upon which we're building, including the store banner.com business, which is up more than 40% year-to-date; the children's business, which continues to grow at a double-digit pace; strong vendor relationships, as seen in the variety of shop-in-shop partnerships we're rolling out or testing and in the very significant portion of exclusive product in our assortments; our geographic diversity, which allows us to spot, capitalize on and even develop trends around the world; our multiple banners, which in the U.S., have already allowed us to broaden our customer set through thoughtful differentiation and which is the same playbook we're drawing from in Germany with the Runners Point, Sidestep and Foot Locker banners; our creative marketing programs, which continue to reach millions of customers and bring fun and humor to our business and our strong capital structure, which allows us to invest in the business, return cash to our shareholders and retain our financial stability and flexibility.","I could go on with examples of initiatives that we're working on that are already contributing to our strong results. Apparel is a growth opportunity as we expected, that's taking longer to gain consistent traction. We're working hard with our key brands to build on the programs that have been successful, get other important programs back on track and develop new programs with vendors, big and small.","We plan to capitalize on the exciting store environments we're creating through our extensive remodel initiatives. For example, we're working closely with Nike on Jordan and women's apparel and closely with Under Armour as we're exploring opportunities to bolster both of our businesses. We're also continuing to push our private brands such as Sneaker Freak, Champs Sports Gear and Actra to become even more relevant parts of our assortments.","And finally, we're driving our apparel results in those banners in which apparel was previously underpenetrated, particularly in kids and women's. Overall, we still believe in our ability to boost our apparel penetration over time back closer to the 30% level it was a decade ago.","I touched briefly before on our remodel program, which, overall, continues to exceed our expectations. Let me give you a few statistics. We remodeled almost 100 stores in the second quarter, the most of any quarter so far and doubled the number in the first quarter. The second quarter, sandwiched as it is between Easter and back-to-school, gives us the largest window to let our excellent construction teams work their magic on the stores. We're on a planned pace to have remodeled 20% of the Foot Locker stores in the U.S. and close to 30% of the Champ Stores by yearend. At the same time, we're testing additional Footaction remodel locations, as Dick mentioned, and testing more SIX:02 stores and rolling out more Bridgewater format remodels in Lady Foot Locker.","Meanwhile, we're testing our remodel formats in international markets, as well as expanding banners and shop-in-shop concepts there. For example, we have 17 Kids Foot Locker stores outside the U.S., as well as 16 House of Hoops shops in 10 other countries around the globe. We're being thoughtful as we execute all of these remodel programs both in the U.S. and internationally, making adjustments, where appropriate, to maximize their potential. These fresh remodels are an important element along with other factors, such as strong marketing programs, and of course, a great pipeline of products from our world-class vendor partners.","That has been -- that has contributed to our ability to buck the declining traffic trends in much of retail. Most of our banners, in fact, have experienced increased traffic this year to last.","In Footwear, both units and average selling prices were up in the second quarter. We're working hard to be able to say the same thing about apparel in the future.","With that, let me just sum it up by saying again that I'm extremely proud of the team at Foot Locker, which produced these outstanding results. At the same time, that the team is delivering record results like this, we're planning for the future, not just by having thoughtful operating strategies and initiatives to build the business, but also by developing leaders across the organization. In fact, just last week, we had the entire senior management team from around the globe together in New York to test drive a new leadership model that we developed specifically for Foot Locker.","It's a powerful model, which can be applied throughout all layers of the store and support organizations, and which I believe can help us take full advantage of all the opportunities the company has in the near, intermediate and longer terms to reach even greater heights of financial and operating performance in the future.","Thank you, all, very much. Let's get to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mitch Kummetz from Robert W. Baird.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess I was just hoping to get even more color on the women's business. I mean, great performance in the quarter, both footwear and apparel. How much of that was the Bridgewater rollout? I mean, where are you guys in that process? Just any more color on this sequential improvement in women's would be very helpful.","Richard A. Johnson","We've said next to -- this is Dick, by the way. We've got 9 SIX:02s, we've got about 60 doors that are Bridgewater. Most of that Bridgewater work happened very -- at the very end of Q2, so a lot of this success in the quarter was driven by the big stores before the Bridgewater remodel. So again, we continue to test and develop the plan, and we're feeling good about the footwear and apparel and accessories business across our women's chain.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then maybe on the margins, Lauren, could you just give us a little more detail? I mean, obviously, you did really well both gross margin, SG&A in the quarter. Just kind of run through the puts and takes on gross margin in terms of the basis point impact on the quarter.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, again, it was 80 basis points of improvement that really came from leveraging the fixed occupancy and buying cost elements. We lowered markdowns in the quarter. And as we've described before, that helps us offset the IMU pressure that is ongoing, primarily from a mix of vendor and category performance. So the underlying merchandise margins ended up flat.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And I know you said more margin or more margin opportunity I think in Q4 than in Q3. Is there any way you can just kind of talk about those puts and takes as they -- you expect them to flow over the balance of the year?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, you're correct, Mitch. So as we're looking at the back half, Q3 has some timing issues in it, right, of the CCS inventory that we're working our way through, and that's putting the additional pressure on merchandise margins. And then in Q3 in particular, as we've described, some of the marketing campaigns for back-to-school are more skewed towards Q3 than early -- than late Q2 as they were last year. And we've got a bit more store closing costs, so that's going to be in Q3.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Lauren, just one more quick follow-up, just for our models on the liquidation of the CCS merchandise this fall. I think that that's finalizing this fall, so maybe a temporary headwind to gross margins, but could you tell us when that CCS drag started on the merch margins for you guys?","Lauren B. Peters","Well, it really started with the announcement that we were going to transition that business to Eastbay, so that was in Q2.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then could you just talk -- Ken, would you be able to talk us a little bit through the apparel trends at Champs? I felt like you were getting pretty comfortable with the overall shift to branded apparel. And then, can you help us think about the crosscurrents that are there today and if there's any -- and maybe some of the details on the strategy in the back half, as well as whether -- you've obviously got crosscurrents from a lift from remodeling these stores, but it sounds like across several of the banners, a drag from the apparel program. Can you help us try to sort out how you look at those heading into the second half?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, Champs has a higher penetration of apparel, as Dick mentioned. One of the challenges is -- challenges are that some of the larger programs that they've had in the past have not been as productive, for example, the licensed business has been more challenging. They had a pretty good-sized license business. We are rightsizing that and focusing them more on performance and training. Some of the brands that they've had, if they have some ups and downs, and we're balancing those out, and the brands are working hard to update what they have. So because of some of the shifts have more of a negative impact on them than the other brands, that said, we've got increases in most of our banners in apparel, and so we think, based upon the work we're doing at Champs, is a shift from some of the down-trending elements into these up-trending elements. And as we remodel and update the stores, which are performing better than the chain, we will see the improvement in Champs, along with the continued improvement in the other divisions.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So is it safe to assume that the remodeled Champs are still in positive territory even though we've got some temporary apparel stuff to work through here?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, overall, they are. Like anything else, there's an outlier on both sides.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess I'd like to -- for Ken, for you on Europe. It looks like footwear up double digits. We're in the early stages, I think, on sort of how that product is being seeded in the market. Maybe just talk to thoughts there relative to the overall macro environment. And it looks like, stepping up the door count, I'm assuming that's mostly Europe, is that core Foot Locker doors? Is that Runners Point? Maybe just some color on Europe today.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. Well, we feel very good about Europe. In fact, we just came back from a board meeting there and let the board see what is happening there and why we feel bullish on it. As Lauren said, all of the countries are positive. That doesn't mean that the economies are great in Europe. There are still challenges, some of which we've now anniversary-ed, but we've learned and have developed our assortments to better fit the environment. We continue to see some strength in running, and we've had some very good results on items like the ZX from Adi, and so we feel good about that. We've also seen a growth in basketball, and so we're working with Nike on their product in basketball and what we're doing there. We've opened up a number of House of Hoops, and that business continues to grow. We're getting -- working on the apparel, again, a bigger apparel concentration in Europe, and so they were impacted more on some of the shifts in apparel. We think that working with the vendors, we're going to be in a better position there. Our expansion, because of just the timing, we have -- we are continuing to expand Foot Lockers in underpenetrated markets and where we see opportunities. And we are also stepping up some of the Foot Lockers by putting in things like House of Hoops, adding Kids Foot Lockers in markets, and so we're developing there. We also had in the pipeline some Runners Point and Sidestep stores, and so we continue to build those. We are, at this time, primarily doing that in Germany, but we see, at some point in the foreseeable future, the ability to expand Sidestep and Runners Point outside of the German market.","Richard A. Johnson","We're also in the test mode with the remodels in Europe. We've got a handful of Willowbrooks that we're making sure that the floor fixtures are dimensionalized appropriately because a lot of the stores have a smaller selling floor than they do in the U.S.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So real quick, Dick, on that, to follow, could you say what percentage is sort of being in the remodel of those European doors?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes. We're just very much in the test on this. So we've got -- it's a small number.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then if I could switch gears, and I'm going to try to delicately ask this question. Again, I don't want you to speculate by any means, but this is important out there. Saw other reports of what's going on with the potential switch here for KD, Nike, Under Armour, maybe just walk us through the implications near term and long term in your view to Foot Locker brand.","Kenneth C. Hicks","I will tell you again, we don't comment on rumors, and I don't -- you probably know more than I do on what's happening there, so that's why we shouldn't comment. That said, we have a very strong set of vendors that have very good portfolios and work hard to make sure that we're positioned properly -- they're positioned properly and we're positioned properly with them. I think that we will have, and our vendors will have a strong portfolio of players and there possibly could be some very short-term disruption. I don't know if there was. But that said, I believe -- we're working with the vendors, and they're working very, very hard to make sure that we offer the best product from the best players all the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to go back to gross margins quickly. From the sounds of it, Lauren, I think you just reiterated the guidance of 30 to 50 bps for the year, although you guys have outperformed that kind of year-to-date. Is there anything that we should be thinking about in the second half that is mix-related or any IMU pressure that could potentially pop up in 3Q or 4Q that was not seen in the first or second quarter?","Lauren B. Peters","On the expectation line, IMU markdown, the strategy remains the same, that we still see the IMU pressure coming from just the mix vendor in category trends. But we feel good about our ability to control the promotional cadence to offset that, right, as we work to get better assortments, et cetera. It helps us with the markdowns. So the only new element, if you will, is the clearance that we need to get through with our CCS products.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just -- if you can just give us an update on Eastbay. Obviously, CCS is getting added into that online business, and the banners are what's seeing the strong growth. Just how should we think about how you're approaching kind of the marketing angle for Eastbay? What's kind of the latest update from a team sports standpoint? I thought Eastbay was going to really be the launching pad for you guys to get more aggressive on that front. Just be helpful -- any color would be helpful.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, we continue to feel good about Eastbay. It continues to run ahead. We put it as part of overall dot-com. But Eastbay is a very important brand to the young elite athlete. And we believe through the marketing of that, both in terms of online and through the catalog, the catalog still shows up in all Locker Rooms, that it's going to be a driving business. We just are coming out with a new program that highlights some of the elite high schools and how those high schools train, and it's in the online site. And I'll tell you what, it's impressive. I'm not sure I could make a team in today's day and age, but it really talks to that young kid. So we're expanding there. We also are expanding our women's, our girls business through Eastbay, and we're seeing some good success there in sports like basketball and volleyball, field hockey. We're expanding in sports like lacrosse. So Eastbay, the site continues to be a strong and important part of our business. We are having good growth in our team sports. The challenge with team sports is, as we expand to other markets, it -- we give up Nexus, and so it's a trade-off between what we do online and what we do in team sports. We want to have a place -- a selling organization in place to offset that. We have seen that when we put that in place, we really haven't had a big impact on the sales of Eastbay online in those markets. The third element of Eastbay and one that we just started, as we said in the beginning -- or in the middle of this quarter, is our new Eastbay Performance Zone in Champs. We've gotten 4 stores in Wisconsin, Milwaukee, California and Florida, and they're off to a very good start, receiving great customer and associate reaction. We've used them for team selling events. And I believe taking that idea to a -- to the market where you take a virtual store and put it in a real store and kids can try on the shoes and see all the different colors that it's -- that's going to be a game-changer for Eastbay, too. So we feel good about Eastbay. We've got what you would consider the traditional initiatives, and we continue to update those, the team sports and sales and now, the Eastbay Performance Zone in Champs that will continue to step it up.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just quickly, there has been maybe a surprising shift away from a trend standpoint of some of the apparel products. What is it that gives you the confidence, in terms of what you're seeing from a vendor pipeline or what the customers are telling you, that gives you the confidence that the footwear aspect will continue to see this type of strength throughout the balance of the year?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, we continue to see great product coming down the pipeline, Paul, from all of our vendors, both on the footwear and apparel side. I think, as Ken mentioned a little bit earlier, as we balance some of the apparel categories, they're really there to help us support our footwear sales. And we want to sell more apparel because we believe it helps us drive footwear sales. But as we look forward from our vendors, both on the apparel pipeline and the footwear pipeline, we see a lot of innovation, we see a lot of freshness and newness from a variety of suppliers. So we have the confidence that both the footwear trend is going to -- we're going to continue to roll in footwear and that the apparel will support that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dick, I was hoping to just follow up on your vendor support commentary. Can you give us -- I know you can't give us a lot of detail for competitive reasons. But could you maybe give us a little more help, as you look at the basketball trend and you look at the launch schedule through holiday of this year and into early spring next year, how you feel about it and maybe a little color on that on the basketball side? And then, could you also maybe give us a little more detail on -- I understand that basketball may be taking some share from running. But if you look at running by itself within your business, are there any positives to call out there or things that can keep the running and your casual footwear business comping as you move against some tougher comparisons this year?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes. I'll start with the basketball and the launch question, Robbie. And launch is a part of our business, but our job is to really grow our core business, as well as working with our vendors to make sure that we've got launch increases. Now we've said many times that the launch calendar is what it is. It flexes by a week here and maybe a different player, whatever it happens to be. But we work closely with our vendors to make sure that the launch cadence is supportive of what we need to do from a business perspective and matches what they need to do. So I'm pleased with where we're at from a launch perspective, but I'm really pleased with where we're at from a core business perspective, and that goes to the running versus basketball that you talked about. And we've called out the ZX Flux, which the team over in Europe has really been having a nice run with. We're bringing that into the U.S. The Roshe Run, which is a casual shoe, obviously, but categorized when we look at running, that continues to be strong. We still sell an awful lot of Free. The Flyknit program from Nike continues to be strong. Our smaller technical brands continue to have some strength. And we look at the fall marathon season and believe that they'll continue to be strong in our business. So the balance between basketball and running, we look at running as being able to continue to sustain comps. And probably, if you look at it across all of the footwear categories, casual is probably the one that's suffering a little bit. When you look at slides and sandals, they seem to be dropping off a bit. That being said, we've got some mix changes with our vulcanized product between Converse and Vans and some of the other vendors. So the balance feels pretty good, Robbie. If we can get some retro trending and some casual pieces to work, it looks even better.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew McClintock from Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering -- you gave some really good color on Europe earlier to Eric, and I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that specific to the e-commerce business. How do you think about that business now that you had it for over a year? Are the growth rates in that business similar to what you're seeing in your dot-com banners here in the U.S.? And are there any differences between how you're thinking about that business in Europe versus thinking about the business in the U.S.?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, we feel very good about the dot-com business in Europe, and it's one of the strengths that we've got with the Runners Point, the Tredex. But we had been developing a good FootLocker.com business and we're now in 9 countries, specifically, but we got a .eu that's across all of -- or most of Europe. And so that business actually has been growing much faster than the dot-com business in the States, but it's a much smaller business, smaller penetration. But we're seeing good acceptance, and we are making the investment in many of the things that we've got in The States in terms of the site, the energy of that, in terms of delivery options. You can actually take more ways -- means of payment in Europe than we can in the States because they have more means of payments. So dot-com in Europe, that's -- it's a small business now, but it's a very fast-growing business and one that we see will become a much more significant part of their portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bernard Sosnick from Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","We're hearing from a large number of retailers that this is not a good denim year, but an active wear year. Could you discuss how this pattern is influencing your business? You've indicated Champs is having difficulty with licensing, but I'm sure that it's a big part of what's happening positively with Lady Foot Locker. And relatedly, was there a chance that with Champs, you're a little late in recognizing the development?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. I think the trend -- what you're hearing from are mainly the women's retailers because the men's retailers have not changed as much, although, there are some trends that we're seeing, for example, in the type of shorts that a guy wore this summer. And -- but in women's, you see a lot more women who are wearing tights and exercise pants and exercise tops around, and there's a benefit there. I think that there's a fashion element of that, but there's also an element that women are just working out more and so they're wearing it more, and they say, \"Okay, I'm not going to go to my workout,\" then change, and then go to Starbucks or -- and the grocery store. \"I'm going to wear my stuff that I worked out in to Starbucks. I'm going to go to Starbucks and then I'm going to go work out.\" So they just find it more convenient, and it's gotten a better look and fashionable, so she can do that. So there's some impact, but I think it's a trend versus cycle that there is a trend that women will be wearing more of this in the future than they have in the past on a continual basis.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","And what about the men's side? I mean, license weakened, but what are you seeing that's replacing it going forward at Champs?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, the actual performance where we see is the strengthening business. More guys are wearing that. Literally, coming back on the plane yesterday from Europe, I'd say half of the guys were wearing performance tops. There weren't a whole lot wearing -- even with the World Cup here, wearing World Cup tops. You thought some of the tourists might have been bringing that back. The -- so that was one. We probably stayed a little bit too long at the party with the size of our license business. There's still a license business out there, it's just not quite as big, and we're seeing more performance. We're also seeing from the -- some shifts in some of the fashion that guys are wearing in terms of the type of shorts or type of fleece bottom they're wearing, and we're making adjustments. Some of that is coming from Europe, some of that is U.S.-specific. But as Dick said, other change where they weren't just depending on some of the stuff historically, they're actually seeing some pretty good business.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","The footwear business is strong overall -- pretty much overall, you've cited certain weaknesses. But included in the weakness, you said casual shoes, and I guess Roshe is in your casual segment and yet performing well. Could you give us a sense of how Roshe is being received? You said it's doing well in Europe. Is it influencing the thought process and the fashion sense overall?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, one of the things I think that's important is, we said Roshe is doing well and it's doing well everywhere, and it's a great shoe. And the ZX is bigger in Europe. They're just now coming to the States. We think that will do well. What's happening is displacing some of the older casual or lifestyle shoes, what the industry calls classics. And so instead of buying an older-type sneaker, people are buying Roshe. I don't know if you want to add something, Dick?","Richard A. Johnson","And the thing about Roshe is that they're at a price point that is very accessible, so they may buy 2 or 3 different colors in Roshe, so that they can hook up with different things. So it's a very positive silhouette around the globe for us.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. You have a lot of stamina, Ken. You sustained 4.5 years of growth. Of course, I know it's with a terrific team, but that's overall to the credit of Foot Locker.","Operator","Our next question comes from Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So one quick follow-up for Lauren, and then a question. The margin guidance that you gave on gross margin and SG&A, is that for the full year or is that for the rest of the year?","Lauren B. Peters","That's for the balance of the year.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, so effectively, the second half of the year?","Lauren B. Peters","That's right.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then a broader question, just on your operating margins, which are obviously a very good quarter, very good last 12-month performance record highs. Can you just remind us, I know you haven't set a new goal of where your margins could or should be, but can you just remind us of the biggest buckets where you have either the greatest visibility and\/or the most room to improve? I know there are many, but I'd love to hear the ones where you see the greatest convictions.","Lauren B. Peters","We have many things that are opportunities in front of us, near term leading to long term, as Ken described in his comments during the call. And all of those add up to increased productivity, whether it's increases sales per square foot. And when you're doing that, that's driving the margin metrics. So we manage that and we pursue the gross margin opportunities that we have with investments such as the allocation system, right, which for us has yet to come online. We begin the process of bringing it online here in the fall. And what that tool does, to spend a minute on it, that it lets us improve getting the right product to the right place, the right time, all of those right, which support greater top line and better margins because you're doing less promoting to correct the places where you sent it and shouldn't have, right? So these are the things that long term will help us and make us very -- feel very good about achieving our objectives on the margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Most of my questions had been answered, but I wondered if you could just spend a few minutes telling us about your longer-term outlook and strategy for Europe. Nike has been very vocal, I think, about their efforts for more category offense in the region. I know you mentioned a few things on the call today with regards to House of Hoops in Europe as well. But overall, what do you see as the ultimate goal for Europe Foot Locker?","Richard A. Johnson","Kate, as Ken mentioned, we've got the opportunity to expand our Foot Locker base in underpenetrated countries. We see the category offense that Nike's pushing as we talked about running as the primary category -- or the lead category, I should say, in Western Europe. But the team over there is working to grow basketball as a significant part of the business as well. And then the apparel piece is one that I talked about earlier that we're working hard at and we think that there are some opportunities. Then when we get into the differentiation of our banners with Sidestep and Runners Point sharing space with Foot Locker in Germany, we believe that once we get those banners clearly defined and differentiated, we will be able to test them going outside of Germany, and that was one of the rationales behind the acquisition. So category offense will play strong, expansion in underpenetrated countries, ability to differentiate the banners and test that, and then the dot-com business that Ken just talked about. So we see opportunities out in Western Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Again, you made a nice call-out about your Asia team, and I know it's small, roughly 90 stores of 3,500 in the chain. But can you talk about -- since you talked about Europe, can you talk about the potential in Asia? Are there any possibilities of increasing the store count there? Do you see a long-term opportunity that maybe we haven't talked about so much on previous calls?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we constantly look and evaluate the opportunities in markets around the world. And at the current time, we don't see an opportunity, but we've got to be open to look and listen, and we've got a strong team in Australia, New Zealand, we've got a good franchise in Korea. And so that's our effort in the Asian market, but we have not announced or have any plans for expanding beyond that.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, Lauren, the growth in the first half of the year in terms of earnings per share has been like 28%, terrific growth. The guidance for the year is double-digit. The market is looking for 11% growth -- EPS growth, I mean, in the second half of the year. Can you maybe just define what double-digit means a little bit more, if possible? Is it closer to what is kind of already in the consensus number? Or is it closer to maybe what you've done in the first half of the year?","Lauren B. Peters","We're not going to go beyond double-digits. We're not giving guidance beyond double-digits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of things. Can you be specific on like how -- what the marketing shift was between Q2 and Q3, or is going to be between Q2 and Q3?","Lauren B. Peters","It's about $2.5 million.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Dick, when you look at the European -- the international business and the challenge in apparel, we saw some data that was saying that a little -- that the licensed apparel for the World Cup did exceptionally well. Were you involved in that business, either here or over there? And did that -- what happened with that?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, we had just a thimble full of World Cup product around the fleet, Sam. And where we had it, it worked well. Like any event merchandise when the event is over, the merchandise sales are over and we got to move on. So it certainly was not impactful to the business. In the specific stores that we featured it, the specific countries that ended up having more success, we sold the product that we had, but it was not a big investment or a big position during the World Cup.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Would that -- with the new allocation system going in 4 years from now, let's say, would that end up being something that you could be more aggressive with, having more information and so on, and being able to allocate it better?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, theoretically, it could be a little bit bigger, Sam. But again, the event stuff drives right up to the date of event and then it drops off dramatically. And with the World Cup, it drops off dramatically as your team gets knocked out in the knockout rounds.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then lastly on -- you commented -- well, on the Roshe, you commented on the 574. Are you seeing other sort of that retro running either from some of the ASICS products, Brooks and others? I mean, are you seeing that also start to gain some momentum?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, I think the ZX Flux is a great example. I mean, that's got a lot of Heritage running characteristics in it, and we're seeing that start to pick up. The team in Europe is certainly getting an awful lot of Heritage running, think about a silhouette like the Max 90 that we talked about, called out earlier, one of the classic Heritage running silhouettes.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And does that -- are you seeing a shift in that Heritage product away from very few people who shop at Foot Locker running the shoes, so they're buying it as fashion. Are you seeing that sort of that fashion look going from that more bright color performance into that more classic styling in a general sense?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, the color is important and whether it's a flash of color or a wild vibrant color or it's the OG [ph] color ways in some of the Heritage running. There's always the necessity for color and it just varies by shade, I think, Sam.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess, I mean, from that real bright flashy stuff that was out over the last year or so.","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, I think there's a bit of a tone down from what it was with the old Brooks, but that's part of just the style trend. And actually, the nice thing is that now they get a flash or one splash of color and so it's blue, and the other one they had a whole bunch of colors. Now they've got to buy some red because they're wearing red. So they got to buy another shoe, which is to Dick's point about you seeing people buying a couple of different shoes in the same style so that they can hook up better.","Operator","Our last question comes from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So first question, not to beat a dead horse here, but just on the apparel piece, particularly in Europe, maybe I missed it, but can you just explain what the specific issue is? Is it private label versus branded? I mean, what it is and what the timing is potentially on maybe seeing some light at the end of the tunnel in that business in Europe?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, so some of it is a mixed situation, Chris, but some of it is just some key silhouettes that have been very successful that have shifted a bit. There's a movement to bottoms that the team is on top of, so we expect to see some good things in Q3. Will that be enough to get the business on the plus side? Too early to tell yet. There's been a little bit of a change from a graphic tee perspective, and the graphics have changed a bit on the tables. So it's -- I think private label versus branded, getting that mix right and getting the silhouettes right, we had a bit of a miss on a short that the finish, the fabrication and the look, the style was a little bit off from what the customer wants. So those things, little things that add up to make a miss.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Is it fair to say, Dick, that it gets less bad, hopefully, in the back half of the year based on some of the changes that you're making or you don't anticipate any improvement?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, we certainly haven't just been there and seen where the assortment is in back-to-school. I'm expecting to see some improvement in Europe's apparel number.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Lauren, just on the merchandise allocation system, when exactly does it go in again? You said in the fall, and I assume it has absolutely no benefit for this year, but in theory, that should help offset the pressure [indiscernible] . Is that fair to say going to next year?","Lauren B. Peters","We'll begin to bring categories onto the tool here in the fall, so over Q3, Q4. And you're right, that the longer it's in, the more benefit we get because it influences product that sometimes, that's the right order. So the benefits grow with time.","Kenneth C. Hicks","And it's a learning system, so as it learns and develops, it gets better. But we literally, in the next couple of weeks, will start our testing, but it's a phased rollout. We're not going to put everything at risk as we introduce the new system. You guys know me well enough to know I have a tendency to -- like to do things thoughtfully, incrementally, but we keep doing them, we keep moving forward and so far, it's working.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Okay, and that certainly showed in the results. The last question I've had -- or I have here is, just for the third quarter, just for -- when you think about gross margin, does the pressure from CCS, which I assume is small, but the liquidations will be significant, does that prevent you, based on the mid-single-digit comp, from showing any gross margin improvement, or you should still see gross margin improvement based on all the other drivers to the business?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. So factoring in CCS, we are looking for the 20 to 40 over the back half.","Richard A. Johnson","We said there was more leverage opportunity in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. But it doesn't prevent you from showing some improvement in gross margin in the third quarter.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, it just makes it tougher because that's when the liquidation is.","John A. Maurer","That's all we have time for now. Thanks, again, for your participation on today's call.

Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Kathy. Greetings, everyone. Welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. As reported in this morning's press release, the company achieved net income of $189 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, up from $158 million in the fourth quarter last year. On a per share basis, we earned $1.42 this year, a 25% increase compared to the $1.14 the company earned in the same period a year ago. As also noted in our release, we had one-time items in fourth quarter both this year and last. This year, there were two large non-recurring items affecting our tax expense. We have adjusted our GAAP results for these items to drive our 2016 non-GAAP results.","The first item is a tax rate change in France that goes into effect in 2019, but which caused us to write-down the value of certain deferred tax assets by $2 million in the fourth quarter, reducing GAAP earnings by $0.02 per share. The second adjustment stems from new regulations issued under Section 987 of the U.S. Tax Code. These regulations require the company to determine the tax effects of the unrealized foreign currency gains and losses on the balance sheets of foreign businesses that are operated as branches. This resulted in a $9 million non-cash reduction in current tax expense, which increased our GAAP earnings by $0.07 per share.","Last year, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $5 million, $4 million after tax in the fourth quarter to reflect the impairment of certain Runners Point Group assets, thus reducing earnings by $0.02 per share. Excluding these items, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.37, an 18% increase over the $1.16 a share we earned on a non-GAAP basis last year.","A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release, and except as otherwise indicated, the numbers mentioned during the balance of our remarks this morning will be based on the non-GAAP results. The strong finish to the year brought our annual non-GAAP net income to $652 million, up 8% from a year ago and our sixth consecutive year achieving record annual earnings. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were $4.82 for the full year, an increase of 12% over last year's $4.29.","For a more detailed look at our fourth quarter financial performance, I'm joined this morning by Lauren Peters, Foot Locker's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. She will be followed by Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer who will touch on product trends and the progress we've made towards our long-term financial objectives as we execute our strategic initiatives.","Lauren will round out our prepared remarks with our initial outlook for 2017. Lauren?","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great performance by our company in the fourth quarter. Starting with sale, we produced a 5% comparable sales gain in the quarter bringing our two-year stacked comp gain to 12.9%. Our total sales for the year were $7.8 billion, a 4.8% increase over last year's $7.4 billion.","Our store segment posted a 4% comparable sales gain in the quarter. The top performance was by Champs Sports, which delivered a high single digit comparable sales increase, powered by a high single digit gain in footwear and a double digit gain in apparel. Foot Locker Canada finished off a stellar year with its fifth straight double digit quarterly comp sales increase. The strong results up north were broad based, with double digit gains in footwear and apparel and a mid single digit gain in accessories.","Our SIX:02 banner generated another outstanding performance, leading our store segment and comp percentage growth for the second consecutive quarter with a strong double digit gain. This encouraging result was fueled by double digit gains in both footwear and apparel, led by lifestyle offerings from PUMA, adidas and Nike. Foot Locker in the U.S. and Footaction also delivered strong sales results, with both banners up mid single digits while Foot Locker Europe comped up low single digits despite traffic challenges across much of the continent.","Kids Foot Locker's comp in the quarter was down at the low end of mid single digits. However, total sales increased low single digits, which reflects the addition of 21 net new Kids' stores in the U.S. during the year. Foot Locker Asia Pacific's comp sales were down mid single digits, largely due to the closure of its high profile George Street store in Sydney for the entire quarter. I'm happy to report that the newly remodeled store we opened in early February and introduced Foot Locker's first truly pinnacle retail experience for our Australian customers.","Comparable sales at our Runners Point and Sidestep stores continued to decline double digits, as both banners continued to face a difficult retail climate in Germany, including especially significant declines in traffic there. Overall, our direct-to-customer segment posted another solid performance in the quarter as it has all year, with a comparable sales gain of 11.3%. This enabled our direct-to-customer business to top $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. Digital sales of our store banners in the U.S. continued to post strong increases, up collectively over 20%, while our digital businesses in Europe and Canada were both up even more. On the other side of the ledger, sales at Eastbay declined mid single digits.","For the quarter, direct-to-customer sales increased to 15.3% of sales up from 14.6% a year ago, and for the year, reached 13.2% of sales compared to 12.7% in 2015. In terms of comparable sales performance for the total company, our monthly cadence was positive throughout the quarter, with November and December comps up mid single digits and January up high single digits. Average selling prices were up, and unlike what we hear from much of the retail industry, our traffic in the U.S. increased low single digits.","From the family of business perspective, both footwear and apparel posted solid mid single digit increases while accessories, which includes socks and hats, were down mid single digits. Within footwear, men's and kids were both up mid single digits while women's footwear had an exceptionally strong quarter, up in the teens. Women's footwear was led by casual styles such as PUMA Suedes and Creepers, and adidas Superstar.","By category, we continue to see many of the same trends we spoke about throughout the year. Strong demand for lifestyle running products led to a double digit gain in running overall, while casual styles and basketball were up low single digits. Dick will provide some additional color on the product trends during his remarks.","Moving down the income statement to gross margin. We produced a 10 basis point improvement in the quarter to 33.7% of sales from 33.6%. We picked up 20 basis points from an improved merchandise margin, largely by once again lowering the mark-down rates in our stores especially on apparel. Merchandise margin gain in the quarter was partially offset by occupancy deleverage. For the full year, gross margin improved 10 basis points, in line with our guidance at the beginning of 2016.","Our team did an excellent job managing expenses in the quarter. Our SG&A expense rate decreased to 18.7% of sales from 19.3% of sales a year ago. SG&A improvement came from levering our fixed expenses and carefully managing variable expenses such as store wages and marketing. For the full year, our SG&A expense rate improved to 19% from 19.1% last year, also in line with our annual guidance.","Depreciation expense increased slightly this quarter to $40 million from $39 million a year ago. For the full year, depreciation and amortization increased 7% to $158 million, due to the ongoing investment in our stores, digital sites, logistics network, and improvements in technology and other infrastructure. For the year, our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes topped $1 billion for the first time in the company's history. As a percent of sales, EBIT reached a rate of 13%, up from last year's 12.8%.","Our fourth quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.1%, slightly below last year's Q4 rate. This was primarily due to the geographic mix of our income. Altogether, the fourth quarter was another period of strong profitable growth for the company, leading to a record full year net income margin of 8.4%, just shy of our long range goal of 8.5%. We invested $284 million of capital into our business in 2016. This was down slightly from our prior expectation, due primarily to shift in the timing of expenditures on certain technology projects into 2017, although the project timelines themselves are mostly unchanged.","We also returned $147 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends during 2016, which, combined with our share repurchase program, brought the total cash return to shareholders for the year to $579 million, more than 85% of our net income. As we announced last week, our board increased our quarterly dividend payout rate by 13% to $0.31 per share, and authorized a new $1.2 billion share repurchase program. We, and the board, believe the company is well-positioned financially to continue returning a significant portion of our annual cash flow to shareholders, while we also make the necessary investments in the business that will drive the company's long-term financial performance.","Before I pause, I'd like to mention our inventory, which finished the year in solid position. At year-end, our inventory was up just 1.7% compared to the 5.3% quarterly sales increase I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks.","Let me now turn the call over to Dick, although I will be back before we get to your questions to provide you with our initial plans for 2017. Dick?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Lauren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your participation on the call this morning. In today's challenging fast-changing retail landscape, the results Lauren just described are a truly exceptional achievement. It took an incredibly talented team of associates to produce the sixth consecutive year of all-time best financial performance as an athletic specialty company. And I want to start off my remarks by sincerely thanking each of our associates for their dedicated efforts in the quarter and throughout 2016. Their work has firmly positioned our banners at the center of sneaker culture, which not only has produced strong results in recent years, but has also established a strong foundation upon which to build and shape our business in the future.","This work is an ongoing effort. We introduced a new strategic framework at the beginning of 2015, and revised the key strategic initiatives that the company has been working on diligently since 2010. These initiatives are: driving performance in the core business; expanding leadership in Kids; expanding in Europe; building our apparel business; elevating our digital business; and delivering growth in the women's business.","As I'll describe next, these initiatives have driven our recent financial success. And we intend to continue to pursue these initiatives further in 2017 to sustain our key leadership position in the athletic retail industry. First, we drove strong performance in our core business, namely our male banners in North America including Foot Locker, Champs Sports and Footaction. Coming on top of last year's outstanding results, this year's strength spans several categories, the most important of which was lifestyle running.","Nike remained the lead brand, with solid sales of Huarache and Presto, along with Air Max products, while adidas led the category's growth, with Nomad, Boost, AlphaBOUNCE, Tubular Shadow, and YEEZYs, all posting strong sell-throughs. The Jordan Retro assortments were very productive in the quarter, helping more than offset the declines in signature basketball. The overall basketball category posted a modest gain for the quarter and full year, led by the Jordan brand and Superstars.","Classic sneakers remain very much on trend in our core business, led primarily by adi and PUMA, although Nike also had successes. The opening of our flagship store on 34th Street in August really energized many of our customers, as has the grand opening of the Foot Locker in Times Square earlier this month. It's great to see the excitement that these pinnacle retail destinations generate for our brand. As Lauren mentioned, we also have reopened a key store in Sydney this month and have similar openings coming up in Chicago, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Melbourne later this year. In other words, we're cultivating that strong connection with sneaker culture in major markets not just in the U.S., but in many of our key cities around the world.","Second, our Kids business continues to generate the largest dollar sales increases among our growth pillars, driven by many of the same styles I mentioned for the core business. Our younger customers are connected digitally at a very early age and they really want the same cool sneakers that their big brother or sister or, oftentimes, their parents are wearing. And they want them now, not a few months down the road. A solid comparable sales increase of Kids footwear within our adult banners was partially offset by the sales decline Lauren mentioned at Kids Foot Locker. In part, this was a function of the fact that not all of today's hottest styles are available on the same timelines in sufficient quantity in kids' sizes. Nonetheless, total Kids Foot Locker sales in the U.S. increased and we expanded the banner's footprint outside the U.S. to 41 at year-end.","Next, our Foot Locker banner in Europe produced another strong year. Although sales did not increase as rapidly in 2016 as they had in recent years, productivity and profitability remained high, with solid momentum across categories and families of business. As we have discussed, our customers in Europe are just as engaged with sneaker culture in their own way as their American peers. We continued to strengthen our pan-European presence by opening 22 new Foot Locker stores over the course of 2016. We're also investing in pinnacle retail experiences in Europe, as evidenced by the new Jumpman store in Paris that we opened in November, in partnership with brand Jordan. We intend to continue to invest aggressively in our European business, including new stores and remodels.","As Lauren mentioned, our German-based Runners Point and Sidestep banners continued to struggle in Q4. We've recently had a management change there and we continue to work internally and with our vendors to position these banners over time with the trend-right assortments that we believe will resonate with their respective customers. We recently opened a new Sidestep store in Cologne, in a space that a Foot Locker store had outgrown and the early results from this somewhat larger space for Sidestep have been encouraging.","Our fourth strategic initiative calls for building apparel penetration and profitability. In this case, we were one out of two, as the profitability piece improved across most of our banners in both the quarter and 2016. In the U.S., the growth of adidas in footwear was mirrored by strength in apparel, whereas internationally, it was Nike that posted the best apparel growth. On the women's apparel side, PUMA also contributed significantly.","The focus on premium asset-connected, and predominantly branded apparel as opposed to the old cotton by the pound model, continues to help augment our connection with our customers beyond sneakers and push apparel margins ever closer to footwear margins. In total, apparel and accessories sales were just under 18% of our business, down a bit from the 18.5% for 2015.","The digital business, our next growth pillar, had a good year, especially encouraging progress in Europe and Canada where the proportion of digital to total banner sales is still relatively low. In the U.S., sales in our much more mature store banner dot-com businesses collectively increased almost 20%. Although we report sales on sales channels, our customers don't think in those terms. They think in terms of our brands, excuse me.","Foot Locker on their smartphone is the same to them as the Foot Locker store and they choose whether to transact with us digitally or in-store based on the variety of factors which continue to evolve. The investments we are making in our new ecommerce platform which will be rolled out by banner during the course of 2017, will provide us with tremendous capabilities to enhance and connect our customer experiences far better than we do today.","The soft spot in our digital business in 2016 was Eastbay. While that customer still loves the performance gear Eastbay is best known for, we could have done a better job than the last year or two, keeping connected with that high-school athlete. While we've been focusing on providing him and her with the latest performance styles, we somewhat lost sight of the fact that for every pair of true performance shoes in their closet or locker, there're probably a half a dozen or more casual athletic pairs in there too.","Our final growth pillar, women's, posted solid improvements in 2016. While the sale of women's footwear in our predominantly male banners was strong virtually all year, the SIX:02 results picked up especially in the second half of the year, after the new flagship store on 34th Street opened. Another key factor was the decision we made early in the year to fully integrate the SIX:02 digital and store teams, which has begun to bear fruit as seen in the substantial momentum at SIX:02.com in the fall season. As Lauren mentioned, much of that progress was driven by our relationship with PUMA and the position we were able to take in the highly sought-after FENTY product by Rihanna.","Looking ahead, the new SIX:02 store in Times Square will introduce the banner to a vast number of new customers and we plan to open a similar pinnacle store in a new Foot Locker location in Los Angeles later this year.","This brings me to the most important piece of our strategic framework; our people. I firmly believe we have the best team in retail, and I can't thank them enough for their performance in 2016. We have an enviable mix of backgrounds at Foot Locker, Inc. For example, we were recently recognized by Fortune magazine as having one of the Best Workplaces for Diversity. We have many industry veterans, people who have been with us for decades as well as some exceptional new talent that has joined us very recently. It's a diverse, inclusive, engaging, forward-thinking, and ever-changing mix of talent, that for me at least, makes everyday a fun and invigorating experience at Foot Locker, and makes Foot Locker a great place to work.","So before we get to your questions, let me turn the call back to Lauren to give you our initial read on 2017.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Dick. We continue to see many opportunities to elevate the business on our way to reaching our long-term goals. As you mentioned in the press release this morning, we are planning yet again for a mid single digit comparable sales gain and a double digit percentage EPS increase in 2017. These plans are based on a comparable 52-week year. This year includes a 53rd week, which we expect will add about $0.12 per share to our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.","While we are optimistic about the full year, the quarterly cadence is not likely to be as even as we produced in 2016: The current delay in the release of tax refunds by the IRS compared to a year ago has led to a slower than usual start in the U.S., which is likely to result in the challenging first quarter. It is our belief that our customers' fundamental appetite for the product has not changed. However, the timing of their cash flows and their ability to buy the product has been impacted.","For the full year, we are planning for a flat to slightly up gross margin rate, driven by a modest improvement in our merchandise margin rate. In terms of SG&A, we will remain disciplined in managing our expenses in 2017. Although there are minimum wage increases and higher health benefit costs, which will make achieving significant leverage a challenge, we are planning our SG&A rate to be flat for the year.","With a shift of some capital expenditures from 2016 into 2017, we are now planning this year's capital program to be $277 million. We continue to invest in the key real estate initiatives mentioned by Dick, along with our store banner remodel program. We finished 2016 having touched just over 40% of the Foot Locker fleet in the U.S., and about a third of the fleet in Europe; just under 40% of the Champs Sports fleet, and about 25% of the Footaction stores. We will make steady progress on each of those banners in 2017 and 2018.","We are also investing in technology and customer experience, including the roll out of the order-planning module of our merchandise allocation system, new ecommerce platform, and the pilot and planned rollout of our new generation point-of-sales system later in 2017. Each of these new systems will be implemented globally, giving each of our banners around the world access to the same best-in-class technology. One result of that investment is additional depreciation, which we expect to be approximately $175 million in 2017. We are planning to open 90 stores and close about 100 stores in 2017. The new stores will be concentrated in Europe, Kids Foot Locker, and Footaction, along with the high-profile Foot Locker and Champs Sports locations that Dick mentioned. In addition, we plan to open three SIX:02 stores in 2017 which includes the second New York City location inside our new Times Square flagship store.","We are planning interest expense to be relatively flat to the $2 million of expense in 2016. For taxes, we are planning for an effective rate of approximately 34% in 2017. For lower rate than past guidance reflects the change required by ASC Topic 718 and the treatment of the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Under the new rule, the tax effects of share based compensation will be recorded on the income statement, rather than equity as before. I would point out, however, that if the level of stock option exercise activity in 2017 is lower than we assumed in the plan, our tax rate will be closer to the 36% it has been in the past.","Our guidance of a double-digit percentage increase in earnings per share also assumes a lower share count, based on the execution of our newly expanded share repurchase program. As a high-performing company, we have built a lot of momentum over the years. We are continuing to make prudent investments in our people, our store fleet, our digital business and our infrastructure in order to deliver even stronger results in the future. We've a lot of really exciting initiatives ahead of us in 2017 that we believe will keep us at the center of sneaker culture, and give us the right foundation on which to succeed over the long-term.","Kathy, let's please open the call for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank Research. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Another great quarter. Congratulations.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just wanted to kind of dig into your guidance for mid single digits comps for this upcoming year despite what seems to be a tough start for broader retail this month. What's in the pipeline that gets you excited? And what is the consumer kind of telling you where they are moving towards from a category or a type of product standpoint?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, Paul, I think that the consumer is moving towards cool, right? I mean, that's what our \u2013 really drives sneaker culture and them finding the coolest sneaker at the right time is what's important. We don't believe that fundamentally, the consumer's appetite has changed at all for products. So the guidance around mid single digit comps, we know that the tax checks are going to flow and we know that our consumer likes to buy new sneakers when they get their tax refunds. So as important as the running category was in 2016, we continue to see that category being important. We see some life in basketball. There's been some sparks that certainly we saw down in New Orleans at the All-Star Game. We expect that to continue to improve throughout 2017.","Casual has sort of the life of its own and the consumer moves from silhouette to silhouette depending on their need on any given day. And then I see continued strength in apparel. So our families of business, from men's, women's, and Kids continue to have opportunity across various categories. So the confidence and our consumer still having a huge passion around sneakers is still there.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's very helpful. And then just around ASP, certainly that was up again. How do you view that to contribute in 2017?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","We expect ASP growth to continue to have some upside, Paul. We've talked about it many times that our ASP model is pretty complex. There's a shift from one silhouette to another in footwear. There's a shift amongst preschool, infant and grade school. There's more expensive apparel that's being sold rather than less expensive. So we see that there is upside in our ASP certainly in 2017.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Right. And even in the classic styles, that customer knows to come to us for unique iterations and that preference they've got tends to help support these ASPs and the growth of.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then very quick, last question just, Lauren, anything we should keep in mind from a cadence standpoint, whether it's via comps or timing of certain expenses flowing through?","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I don't know what more I would add on the top-line to what Dick has already described. We continue to believe that there's opportunity in margin, as we work on allocation, et cetera. And on SG&A, as we evidenced throughout 2016, we carefully control that, but as far as unique, I mean the only thing that's unique was our first quarter office relo that pops to mind, yeah, from a non-GAAP perspective.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the help. Best of luck to you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Marjorie Lopez Marinez - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is Marjorie Lopez on for Matt McClintock. Thank you for taking our question. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about your remodeling program, and to understand if you're going to make any changes in 2017. And also, in terms of the improvements you've made in the two New York locations for SIX:02, will you be applying these learnings and changes to your older SIX:02 stores or just the new ones going forward? Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, in terms of remodels, we've talked about an ongoing program. Lauren detailed the capital expense plans for 2017. So we'll continue certainly to upgrade the fleet. And we manage a big portfolio of stores and with our real estate and store development team continue to identify the right opportunities to upgrade those stores from a remodel perspective. So that program will continue.","And we certainly have had some great learnings with SIX:02 on Times Square and on 34th Street. And, as Lauren mentioned, or I guess I mentioned, we'll open another SIX:02 store inside a flagship Foot Locker out in Los Angeles later this year. We will continue to upgrade our current fleet from the learnings that we've got around brands, merchandising, et cetera, that we learned from these two pinnacle spaces; also take some of the learnings that we get from our online digital business. Are there brands that we've tested there that we should roll out? Those are the key learnings that we'll use to help mature that SIX:02 brand.","Marjorie Lopez Marinez - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, I wanted to get a little bit more color on the Kids Foot Locker performance. I know you mentioned differing timeline and not sufficient sizes for popular styles in Kids. How should we think about this going forward? And just in terms of looking at it from a historical perspective, was this worse than in the past? Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, Kids Foot Locker did underperform its past track record, and I think certainly the fourth quarter was in (39:33) a bit of an anomaly. We still have a lot of faith in the Kids Foot Locker banner as we continue to expand its footprint. We had some doors where we added a partnership space, the Fly Zone, so there's some learnings that go along with the right amount of space allocation between the Fly Zone product and the base Kids Foot Locker product.","So our Kids Foot Locker team is energized for 2017 and they're certainly making great decisions in terms of the products that they're flowing in. We continue to work with our vendors to help them understand that our family of muse is actually in Kids Foot Locker between the young male, the young female, and the parents that are providing the money to shop, they look for the same products as Foot Locker has, or Lady Foot Locker, SIX:02 or Champs Sports have all at the same time. And we're working with our vendors to try to ensure that deliveries line up, so that when cool hits the big brother store, it's also there for the little brother.","Marjorie Lopez Marinez - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","And that customer is really technically wired and are digitally savvy and they know as much about this product as their big brother. So they want it at the same time.","Marjorie Lopez Marinez - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you for that.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Okay, Kathy?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey good morning, guys. Great quarter in a very tough fourth quarter for most.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Dick, two topics I was hoping you could maybe help us with. One, I know it's hard to quantify, but can you give us a sense of where, when you look at the casual style percent of your business or mix of your business, where are we versus historical standards and maybe a sense of how far and how long can casual keep leading the way? I think even in basketball, you mentioned Superstars as one of the drivers, so even basketball sounds like it's leaning very casual.","And then the other topic, it sounds like, and, again, I may be wrong in this, but it sounds like the trends in Europe are very different than the U.S. in what's driving the business. And also, you called out traffic. It sounds like it might mostly be Germany, but can you also just sort of give us some color on what's going on in Europe versus the U.S.? And is it deviating more than usual in terms of what are driving those two regions? Thanks.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Robby. First, from a casual perspective, I think it's important to remember that virtually the vast majority of our shoes are sold from a casual hook-up to what I'm wearing today sort of mindset for our consumer. So again, Superstars in basketball, Huaraches in running, all of those sneakers are viewed \u2013 we put them in categories, but just the same way that our customer doesn't think in channels, they don't really think in categories.","So wherever the heat is brought by our tremendous vendor partners, the consumer is going to move there. Whether they decide to play basketball in a basketball shoe or they decide to hang out on the street with their friends, they're the ones that ultimately make the determination. So, I don't want to get into sort of the crystal-balling of how each category will respond. I have a huge amount of faith in our vendor partners and our merchant teams to move the dollars where the customer is and is going to be.","So, again, I don't worry about casual versus basketball versus running. I'm sure that there are models out there that want to understand how each of those levers move, but our kid is really concerned about the coolness of the sneaker, not the category that it comes from.","And I think the trends in Europe, just to get to your second question Robby, the trends in Europe have always been a bit different. Running was far more important to Europe from a category and coolness perspective than it is in the U.S. The team over there is trying to help the consumer understand how cool some basketball silhouettes are. The vendor mix is a little bit different, still the same group of vendors but the percentages are different continent-to-continent. So I don't see that there's been any acceleration or significant change in the trends. And I think it's just that the trends get a little more accentuated because the running silhouette is the coolest silhouette that's out there right now for most consumers.","Traffic, certainly Lauren called out the traffic in Germany as being down. We saw traffic in some other countries impacted by some of the macro events that have happened across Europe, but the consumer is still shopping. They certainly still want sneakers. As Lauren pointed out, the Foot Locker Europe comped up for the fourth quarter after being down a little bit in the third quarter. So again, good response from the consumer in Europe.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","You bet, Robby.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. And great quarter, guys.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So on the gross margin, can you just help rank the merchandise margin drivers this year? And just, Dick, what do you see as the appropriate level for the business on gross margin from 34% today? Do you still continue to see opportunity?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","We continue to believe that there's leverage. I'm not going to rank them for you, Matt. You know, we...","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","We worked on all the levers.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Exactly. And they don't necessarily move at the same pace. So, Lauren mentioned rolling out the second phase of our merchandise allocation system, the order-planning piece. And we've talked about that over the past quarters that it's a learning system and the allocation piece continues to learn, and our team continues to learn with it, to work with it. And now we'll feed that information into the order planning end of it, which again should help us order the right quantities and then the allocation piece helps us get those quantities in the right stores at the right times, so don't have to take as many markdowns or ship as many products store-to-store.","So we continue to work with our vendor partners to drive great, exciting product. As the product excitement continues to grow, we operate at the premium end of the spectrum and try to manage the markdowns. Certainly we \u2013 it's not that we don't have markdowns in the store, but we try to manage them. So each of the levers gets worked on and the teams are very aggressive to continue to get some leverage in the margin line.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","So we've continued to see improvement made in the footwear margins, and in the fourth quarter especially improvement came out of apparel. So as that growth initiative gains traction and we can continue to improve on those apparel margins, that further supports our overall merchandise margins.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then just on the SG&A front, so really nice leverage in the fourth quarter on the mid single digit comp. Lauren, can you just elaborate a little bit on some of the headwinds offsetting your ability to leverage more this year if you were to hit a similar mid single digit comp.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yeah. So the bigger components within SG&A being selling wages and then our marketing publicity. On the selling wage front, a bit of the headwind is in the U.S. We've got changes in minimum wage and health care costs, but as you've seen us do, we're very, very careful about managing the hours to make sure that we've got the hours where we've got peak traffic and that helps us manage through that. So we remain focused on having very competitive pay for our sales associates where \u2013 have a commission structure that works nicely in ensuring that as your wages change, you're also driving the top-line to help manage the rate, but it's a dynamic that we have to very closely manage.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. Okay, Kathy?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sam Poser with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Couple of things; number one, can you talk about what your thoughts are on border adjustment and on all this new tax policy going on? You've got to be paying close attention to that.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yeah. Sam, this is one place that I don't know that there's a game plan, right. So the shift is going to be a little bit hard to read. The February started with a weak difference in President's Day and the All-Star Game shift. The start of Easter is a couple of weeks later, the Easter season. So there's a lot of moving parts, probably the biggest of which is the PATH Act that required certain EITC and child care credits...","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Dick, I was asking about the border adjustments, not about the (49:29)...","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. I thought you meant the income tax.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","No.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","So, no. Sam, I think it's too early to speculate about a border adjustment tax. Certainly we know that there aren't very many sneakers made in the U.S. at this point. So obviously depending on whatever the administration ultimately ends up putting in place, we'll have to react. And we'll work with our vendor partners to understand. I think the implications and the impact to our core consumer of a border adjustment tax is it's fairly significant. So, it's...","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Across many categories of spending for them, not just our product.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","That's right.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then secondly, can you talk to \u2013 on the week 53 this year and then the take-out next year, Lauren, can you give us some idea of \u2013 you said it's $0.12, but can you give us the dollar amount for that week on how you're modeling it for how much that week is worth from a dollar amount and then how much we'll have to take out next year? And could you give us any thought as to how to think about 2018, because you're going to have week one next year up against week two this year on a comp basis. It's very dizzying, more next year than this year.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yeah. Welcome to our world.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Is it dizzying for you? $0.12, that's what our current model is on the bottom-line and tied to that. Our last 53rd week was 2012. So if you went back to that, you'd get some more color around top-line, bottom line, et cetera but we recognize as we work through the math, that we're a bit more productive than we were in 2012 and so we've factored that into the thinking.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","We haven't started looking at the quarters of 2018 and how they're going to compare to 2017 yet. That's an exercise for the future.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I was more \u2013 not about specific guidance but just to let people understand how the weeks match up because you guys generally give a comp by week guidance and then there's a variance off of the revenue because the fiscal month doesn't match up with the comp, looking into 2018.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","We don't give that kind of guidance.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","We don't give out comp week guidance. Again, I think Lauren's point is right. If you go back and look at 2012, you'll have a better understanding of the pattern, but that's the level of detail we're going to provide.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. Well, thanks very much and continued success.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Great job on the quarter.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Camilo.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I wanted just to get a little bit more clarity on what your thinking is around these tax refund delays. And if you consider them, Dick and Lauren, as loss sales or sales that will be recovered in the later weeks when those refunds do flow? And if you can give any sort of detail or guidance on how these delays are impacting the Q1 comps, just so that we have our models appropriately tuned into what's actually happening here? That'd be great.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yeah. Camilo, we're not going to go back to giving quarter-to-date comps. We stopped that a few quarters ago and we'll stay in that position. The guidance that Lauren gave for the full year is pretty clear; the mid single digit comp and double digit bottom-line that we believe that we'll achieve. The challenge will be this game plan that we don't have for the shift in tax returns that I started to explain to Sam, but was answering the wrong question.","So, the year has some shifts in it, right? The year, or the week shift of the All-Star Game, the week shift of Presidents' Day, the start of Easter being later, so Mardi Gras and Carnival all shifting and then the PATH Act that required this delay in some of the tax returns. So certainly, there have been buying opportunities that have passed when our consumer didn't have cash in their hands, but we firmly believe that the consumer still has a huge desire for the products that we have in our store. We have a huge belief that our vendors continue to bring heat in our category to our stores and websites. So, we're confident that the sales will start to flow when the tax checks start to flow.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","And is there an expectation that those sales will be recovered once those flows actually start coming through, or are they just past and will be lost and therefore you're kind of saddled with releases that were launched during that period that no one was able to buy? Just trying to understand really the dynamics that have happened and maybe there's some historical context you can reflect on?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, there is no historical context, unfortunately. We've had minor delays in tax checks being issued, but never sort of this glut that built and built. So...","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","But we're not selling lettuce that has a really short shelf life, right? So as the cash flow improves, we know we've got really cool product that the customer will find in our store.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Great. Then, if we could just shift gears a little bit towards a comment you made, Dick, about basketball seeing some life and that you would expect it to improve throughout the year. Could you just describe what you think will drive that improvement? Is it more just that it's easier comparisons or that you're actually seeing some product that's coming down the pipeline that is exciting that you think will reinvigorate the category?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, it's combination of both. We know that certainly end of 2015 and throughout 2016, basketball had some challenges, especially in the signature basketball category. And we need to sort of confine the remarks to signature basketball, because as we talked about on basketball business, in totality, when you throw in the Retro, some of the Casual things was up for the quarter and the year. So, we've seen some sparks that our team was down in New Orleans over All-Star week.","And, again, there were people lined up for basketball and basketball-related products that seemed to be indicating that when the right product is there with the right story, the right asset, there's still excitement around the category. So, as we look through 2017, we certainly see some things changing from all of the key vendors from a basketball perspective. So, we've said all along when the excitement and the price value relationship is there for our customer, they will gravitate to whatever the coolest at the time. And I envision or I see certainly some basketball product that I think will continue to excite our consumer.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, great. And then my last question, it's pretty remarkable that you're continuing to experience positive traffic when I don't think anyone else is, certainly in the mall. Could you just remind us what it is that you're doing or what it is that you have, relative to even your competitors, that allows you to continue to generate positive traffic growth in the U.S.?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, I give our team a ton of credit. I mean, they do a great job on the social media and through the digital arm to drive excitement for products that are being found in our store. I give our store associates a tremendous amount of credit, because they want to engage when the customers come in. We're focused on creating consistent, authentic and memorable experiences for our consumers, so that the striper, the person in Footaction, the guy or gal in blue at Champs, they're the resident experts. The stylists \u2013 the style associates that we've got in our SIX:02 business. Our consumers want to be there. And they see it a place where there is cool product, they're among their peers, they're among their friends. And there is an environment that they're comfortable to shop in.","Not all of our stores are like 34th Street and Times Square, but there's still a level of excitement that's brought by the product and the associates in the door. The energy level is high. They're just great places. And a lot of credit goes to the teams that make \u2013 help, I should say, not make \u2013 that help drive the excitement. But it also goes to our vendor partners who bring great products. They connect those products with great stories and assets that allow our consumer to really find them relevant and cool.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","So, our customers know. They got to come into our brands to check it out, because we're going to have the coolest stuff, and that shows up in that traffic number.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Perfect. So, just one final one on the Q1. Could you just tell us what's the largest month within the quarter? Just trying to understand the weightings of February, March and April.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, historically, February would be, but with the Easter shift, I mean, this year's a little bit of a different dynamic. But historically, February would be the largest month of the quarter.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Good luck with the year.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you, Camilo.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Okay, Kathy?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Svezia with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the quarter as well.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","I guess, just, I want to go back to this first quarter for a second. I think last year, we had somewhat of a similar slightly maybe less delay with regard to tax refunds. I think, Lauren, you called out that you expected double-digit earnings growth for the year and mid-single digit comp. However, Q1 will be hard, I think, to do that, in part maybe due to the timing of tax refund. Is that a fair characterization, maybe as we think about Q1 relative to your annual guidance for the year, just given how Q1 is starting?","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","There is a difference in the tax shift of a year ago and the delay this year. They're just different orders of magnitude.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","And if you go to the IRS, the February 10 data, they were 60% behind distributing checks. The data that's out there from February 17 has caught up a bit, but they're still significantly behind in the distribution of checks. And the distribution of checks doesn't necessarily correlate to when the money is available in accounts, et cetera. So, again, there is not a historical reference that we can use that has shifted this amount of tax money this much.","So, again, as Lauren said, and I said in my prepared remarks, the first quarter is going to be a bit more challenging, but we're highly confident that we can deliver double-digit bottom line growth and mid-single digit comps for the year.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","For the year.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","For the year? But that's when the...","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","It points back to the customers' appetite for the product hasn't changed. This is a cash flow for them with the tax refund delay.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, just to be clear, so, every quarter you expect mid-single digit comp and double-digit earnings growth, does it apply...?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","I don't think that's what we said. We expect to deliver double-digit EPS growth...","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","For the year.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","...and mid-single...","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","And mid-single digits for the year.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Year, but not necessarily for the first quarter. That's all I'm just trying to...","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","We haven't given quarter-by-quarter guidance.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","We didn't give quarter guidance. We've got this first quarter that we're dealing with.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. With regard to the gross margin and SG&A guidance that you gave flat on gross margins, up in SG&A, flattish in terms of sales, that excludes the extra week, Lauren, correct?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yeah.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yes. It does not include the 53rd week.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. And then finally, just on apparel, I guess, great to see the performance. Lifestyle apparel seems to be working. You're doing a nice job on the brand and private label side. If that were to continue to comp at the rate that it's comping, do you believe you'll start to cross-over footwear relative to merchandise margins, potentially in 2017? In other words, any update on where we are on that?","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, we would describe it as the chase on gross margin rate is back on between footwear and apparel. We have, over the years, continued to make progress on footwear margins. That was true in 2016. But, we had good improvement in the productivity of those apparel margins in 2016. So the chase is back on, if you will. We think, long-term, the finish apparel margins can be meaningfully ahead of footwear margins. And again, it's about lowering overall markdown rates on that apparel.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. All right. That's all I had. Thank you, and all the best to you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Kathy, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tom Nikic with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Nikic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick one on the gross margin line, I guess, on a 5% comp, there was a little bit of occupancy deleverage, which kind of seems like a bit of a high hurdle to get over. I was just kind of wondering for going forward, how we should think about the leverage point on occupancy. Thanks very much.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yeah. So, part of this dynamic is that we have these high-profile locations that we've gone into and they come with higher rent. Also, as you're building those out, you get some dark rent, if you will, and that we're building out the store if it's not open for sales yet, so we're paying rent. And that's part of the pressure. But as you get further into those doors being opened, the return on them improves and the leverage point would improve. For 2017, we are, with this leverage that it needs a solid mid-single digit to lever that occupancy. But future periods that should start to improve again.","Tom Nikic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much. Best of luck this year.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Tom.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Okay. That concludes the call for today.

Please note that this call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to John Maurer, Vice President and Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may now begin.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you, Tommy. Hello, everyone. We're pleased to have you join us this morning to discuss Foot Locker, Inc.'s results for the third quarter of 2017. Joining us on today's call are Lauren Peters, Foot Locker's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will start our prepared remarks with a detailed review of our financial results and an update of our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2017; and Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will discuss how we are positioning the company for success in the midst of the changes we see with our customer and within the broader athletic industry.","First, though, I'll provide you with a brief summary of the company's results which were broadly in line with our expectations going into the quarter. We reported a comparable sales decline of 3.7%, and net income of $156 million (sic) [$157 million] which equated to earnings of $0.81 per share. These results included a $13 million pre-tax charge related to reducing and reorganizing our divisional and corporate staff, which both Lauren and Dick will touch upon further. This charge equals $0.06 per share, thus on a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.87.","A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the press release issued earlier this morning. I will now turn the call over to Lauren.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good morning to all of you and thank you for your interest in Foot Locker. As John mentioned, third quarter comparable sales declined 3.7%, within the down 3% to 4% guidance we provided on our prior call and, as expected, an improvement over the decline we experienced in the second quarter.","Our comp was negatively affected by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Overall, we had almost 450 stores closed at some point during the third quarter, as a result of these storms. Although for the most part, sales recovered in Texas and Florida within the quarter. The primary impact on us was actually from Hurricane Maria, which shut down all 56 of our stores in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. And most of these stores remain closed for a month or more after that devastating storm hit in mid-September. Our thoughts are with the people in the Caribbean and elsewhere, including hundreds of our own associates who are continuing to cope bravely with the devastation left behind by this season's hurricanes.","We estimate that the net sales loss primarily due to Maria, lowered our overall comp by 20 basis points to 40 basis points. The hurricanes also led to significant inventory losses which I'll get to when I talk about SG&A.","In terms of Cadence, comp results were steady throughout the period, with results in August, September, and October all within the quarterly guidance.","Let's now review the details of our performance starting with our families of business. As expected, Footwear remains challenged and decreased mid single-digits. Apparel, on the other hand, was strong, producing a mid single-digit comparable sales gain, with increases across men's, women's and kids. Accessories, such as socks and hats, comps down double digits. Within Footwear, sales of men's shoes were down low single-digits; kids decreased mid single-digits; and women's posted a double digit decline.","Running remains the strongest category in men's footwear, finishing with a high single-digit comp gain, which was driven by VaporMax, Tuned Air [Air Tuned] and Air Max 97 from Nike and, NMD, Tubular Shadow, EQT, and Ultra Boost from Adidas. Although the men's basketball category decreased mid single-digits, this trend improvement over the double digit decline in Q2 was driven by stronger sell-throughs of select Jordan Retro releases compared to Q2 and other casual basketball styles such as Air Force 1s from Nike.","Finally, within men's, casual styles posted a double digit drop, as strong demand for Vans, especially old school and skate high styles, was more than offset by a decline in Converse and a slower start to our Timberland business compared to last year.","Decline in children's footwear sales was driven by the shifts away from signature basketball and casual court style. However, the overall downtrend in the kids business did improve versus Q2, due to the higher sell-throughs for the Jordan Retro releases I just mentioned, a solid running category led by Tubular Shadow and Xplorer, and positive results for the LeBron 15, and LeBron Soldier.","On top of the ongoing slow sell throughs of Superstars and Stan Smiths, trends in our women's footwear softened further during the quarter, due to a lack of new on trend offerings to offset last year's strong demand for PUMA Fenty styles. The weaker footwear sales had the biggest impact at SIX:02 and led to a double digit comp decline for that banner.","Turning to our apparel business, we were quite pleased that it was up mid single-digits with strong gains across most of our geographies and banners. Branded fleece and wind wear assortments from Nike, Adidas and Champion were the key on trend items during the quarter. Our branded T-shirt business also had a strong quarter.","Overall, ASPs in apparel were up high single-digits, reflecting the more premium assortments in our inventory, while units were down low single-digits. Our children's apparel business was up high single-digits. Men's apparel posted a solid mid single-digit gain, while women's was up double digits, however, the gain in women's apparel was largely mark-down driven.","Breaking out the comparable sales results by segment, direct-to-customer posted a 6.1% increase, while our stores were down 5.1%. Starting with the direct-to-customer segment, Eastbay generated a high single-digit top line increase. Our store banner dot-com businesses in the U.S. and Europe were both up mid single-digits, while our digital sales in Canada increased at a strong double-digit rate.","Overall, direct-to-customer sales increased to 13.8% of total sales, up from 12.8% a year ago. Within our store divisions, Foot Locker Canada and Footaction posted solid results, both generating low single-digit comp increases, led by double digit gains in apparel and mid single-digit gains in men's footwear. The other store divisions posted comparable sales decline. In the U.S., Foot Locker was down low single-digits, while Kids Foot Locker and Champs Sports were each down mid single-digits. Overall, traffic at our U.S. stores declined mid single-digits.","Internationally, traffic also declined mid single-digits. Comparable sales at Foot Locker Asia Pacific and Sidestep were down mid singles, while Foot Locker Europe and Runners Point were both down low double-digits. Sales at Foot Locker Europe, which has a relatively high penetration of Adidas, were pressured by further declines of Superstars and Stan Smiths, and lower than expected sell-throughs of some other Adidas styles.","Moving on to the rest of the income statement, gross margin decreased 290 basis points to 31% of sales. The lower rate was driven by a 190 basis point decrease in our merchandise margin, a 10 basis point increase in shipping expense, and 90 basis points of deleverage on our occupancy and buyers compensation expenses. The lower merchandise rate, both year over year and compared to last quarter's guidance, was the result of higher markdowns, both in store and online. The higher markdowns reflect our ongoing efforts to drive traffic and clear slow-moving inventory in the current promotional retail environment.","Despite this even greater than anticipated markdown pressure, average selling prices in footwear were actually up low single-digits, while units were down high single-digits. Our SG&A expense rate rose in the quarter by 30 basis points to 19.7% of sales. Included in SG&A were $7 million of hurricane-related expenses, including lost inventory, damage to fixed assets, and repair and maintenance expenses. Although we did not adjust our non-GAAP results for these costs, which total about $0.03 per share, SG&A would have levered by 10 basis points during the quarter, had these hopefully one-time costs not been incurred.","The expense rate performance was driven by the team's consistently strong expense management, which helped offset some of the pressures from minimum wage increases and higher health care costs. The $13 million reduction in force and reorganization charge that John mentioned was part of an overall strategy to address the challenges we are facing in today's fast-changing retail environment. The vast majority of the charge relates to severance. The changes, while difficult, position us to create a more agile, flexible organization that will concentrate on those strategies that we believe will most effectively drive our long-term earnings growth. Dick will comment further about these initiatives in a few minutes.","Depreciation expense increased to $44 million from $40 million in the prior year. The increase reflects the investments we have made and continue to make in our store fleet, digital capabilities, and logistics network. On a GAAP basis, our tax rate came in at 34.7%, 380 basis points higher than last year. As you may recall, the lower rate in the third quarter last year reflected the benefit from an intellectual property valuation reassessment in Europe. On a non-GAAP basis, our tax rate was 34.8%.","Inventory ended the quarter down 3.4% from a year ago compared to an overall sales decrease of 0.8%. On a constant currency basis, inventory decreased 4.9% compared to a 2.3% total sales decrease. Our proactive markdown actions during the quarter helped ensure that we are headed into the holidays with the ability to flow in good quantities of our improving product assortments.","We ended the quarter with $890 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $25 million from the end of Q3 last year. We mentioned on our last call that we and our board are fully confident in the ability of our business to reaccelerate over time, and that we would consider a full range of share repurchase alternative. Given that, and in light of the value we saw in the price of the company's stock, we significantly accelerated our buyback program, spending $304 million to repurchase 8.7 million shares during the quarter. In addition, we returned $38 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividends. In total, we have returned $482 million to shareholders year-to-date. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $54 million, bringing our total through the first nine months of the year to $204 million. We are on track to spend almost all of the $277 million we planned for 2017.","Turning to real estate. We ended the third quarter with 3,349 company-owned stores, a decrease of 10 from the end of the second quarter. For the year, we currently expect to close 150 stores, up from the 135 we mentioned on the last call. We'll open about 90 stores and relocate or remodel 180 stores.","Before I turn the call over to Dick, let me make some comments about how we see Q4 unfolding. We now expect comparable sales to decline 2% to 4%, slightly better than the previous guidance of down 3% to 4%. Gross margin is likely to decrease 220 basis points to 240 basis points in Q4 on a 13-week basis. This decline is steeper than our guidance in August due to the anticipated need to maintain relatively high markdowns in Q4 to move through slow-moving inventory to position ourselves for a stronger 2018.","SG&A is likely to increase by 60 basis points to 80 basis points as a rate of sales. This is improved from the guidance we gave on the last call due in large measure to the recent reduction in force I mentioned, and a timing shift of certain projects into early 2018. In total, EPS is likely to decrease between 15% to 25% in the fourth quarter. Please remember that this guidance does not include the 53rd week, which we still estimate will be worth an incremental $0.12 per share.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dick to discuss our initiatives that we believe will reposition the company for long-term growth. Dick?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. It's great to have you join us to discuss Foot Locker's performance and outlook for the future. Before I get started describing the current business dynamics, I want to circle back to the third quarter reorganization charge. While it was a very important step in keeping us headed in the right direction on this journey through the turbulence that defines the retail industry today, it was also a very difficult and painful step. It was hard to see people who had contributed a great deal to the company leave the business, and I want to sincerely thank them for all they did. At the same time, I want to thank the outstanding team of associates at the company today for their leadership in positioning Foot Locker for continued success in our industry.","With the disruption we are witnessing in retail in general and the athletic industry more specifically, we will have to make many critical decisions as we shape our future. However, the actions we are taking now are not meant to simply enable us to survive in the evolving retail market. Rather, we are proactively adjusting our course to ensure that Foot Locker will continue to thrive at the center of sneaker culture or more broadly, youth culture. Through the creation of outstanding customer engagement, experience and satisfaction, we believe we will also thrive financially in terms of shareholder returns over the long term.","Let me tell you about a few of the things we are doing to achieve that. First, we are reorganizing our North American businesses to give all channel responsibility to the general managers of each of our banners under the leadership of Jake Jacobs. The level of coordination between the store divisions and our digital commerce team in Wisconsin has improved tremendously over the years. However, having the two groups managed separately, while an effective strategy for the past 20 years is no longer the best approach to creating a seamless brand experience. A critical step in the process of removing friction points for our customers is having fully integrated sales channel responsibility for each banner.","At the same time, we are investing in the creation of a North America product marketing strategy team, led by Andy Gray, which will work closely with our vendors in the cultivation and development of unique product platforms and stories that only a partner with the power and reach of Foot Locker Inc. can scale globally. The primary charter of Andy's team is to create significant incremental revenue streams through new brand and product ideas.","A perfect example of the sort of vendor collaboration with our portfolio of brands that this team will be amplifying is today's formal announcement of Foot Locker's partnership with Nike on Sneakeasy, NBA Player Editions at House of Hoops, and Nike Pro Associates at Foot Locker. Sneakeasy, for example, is a window to what's next in the world of sneakers, which will come to life next week during Foot Locker's Week of Greatness. In this case, Nike is clearly demonstrating what differentiated retail looks like for them, and how their top strategic partners, like us, play a key ongoing role in bringing it to reality. I'll let you learn more of the details from our joint press release with Nike, which is coming out shortly. But suffice it to say, we are very excited for the future, as these truly innovative ideas turn into great experiences for our customers.","Another key initiative, as you know, is concentrating a significantly greater portion of our capital and operating spending in enhancing our digital capabilities. We are making solid progress on several fronts, including three of the biggest initiatives which I have discussed previously. Our new digital e-commerce platform, our mobile app platform development, and our new POS technology. Each of these multi-year projects will play a key role in enhancing how our customers experience and engage with our banners. Among many other customer-facing benefits, we expect to leverage greater visibility of the shopping and buying patterns of individual customers and households into much more effective loyalty and marketing program initiatives, have quicker visibility and access to inventory across our entire enterprise thus speeding up customer access to all of our great product, and create elevating storytelling and alignment between our stores, digital sites and mobile apps, all of which should lead to higher customer satisfaction and ultimately even higher rates of converting shoppers into buyers.","These three initiatives have a very important behind-the-scenes benefit as well. All of our e-commerce sites globally will finally be on the same platform. Our mobile apps will also be on a common global platform and for the first time ever all of our stores around the world will be operating the same POS software. Once fully rolled out, the common platforms and software will greatly enhance the efficiency and speed at which we can make ongoing upgrades and improvements across all of our banners, in turn enabling us to stay at the forefront of technology, which we know is extremely important for our always on, always connected consumers.","Among other benefits, this simplified architecture will facilitate enhanced data analytics, which is a key component of connecting ever more personally with our existing customers as well as those potential consumers who share key characteristics with our top customers.","We are currently in the process of prioritizing a number of other digital projects, based on projected returns, balanced with incremental cost and risk. While speed is important, we know there's nothing that slows down an organization's progress more than having to stop and rework a critical system that was not implemented thoughtfully and carefully. Put together, though, we are confident these investments will be critical to keeping our banners top of mind with our customers, as well as with our top vendors when it comes time to cement strategic partnerships such as the ones we are announcing today with Nike.","Related to digital functionality, we are also making significant investments in our supply chain capabilities. The first step, which is well underway, is the process of reconfiguring our primary warehouse in Kansas, to be able to fulfill direct to consumer shipments, easing the constraints on the DTC facility in Wisconsin, which came with the original Eastbay acquisition. This step should be complete by the middle of next year. To facilitate faster delivery of products bought online, we are going to test the mini hub concept in certain major metropolitan areas. These mini distribution hubs will hold inventory to replenish stores more quickly and efficiently than from Kansas thereby, over time, reducing the need for expensive backroom retail space. Even more importantly, we expect mini hubs to facilitate next day or perhaps even same day delivery for DTC orders. We are upgrading a facility in New Jersey as well as an existing logistics facility in central Pennsylvania to handle large sections of the East Coast, and we will test other locations in 2018.","With all this discussion about digital and supply chain investments, I don't want to overlook that the majority of our capital is still spent on our store fleet, which after our people, is one of our most important competitive advantages. Keep in mind that our store banners collectively still do less than 10% of their sales digitally despite the fact that we've had internet sites and DTC fulfillment capabilities for 20 years. And the core customers of most of our banners, young males from about 12 to 25 years old, were essentially born with a mobile device in their hand.","Our customers value a compelling store experience and the integration of the digital in-store experience remains a critical element of fulfilling the customer's desire for an emotional connection with the premium sneakers and apparel that we sell. Kids today, our core customers, aren't just sitting at home buying shoes on a screen or device. They want to be part of something, engaged with the things that are important to them. Our banners and stores are a key component in their connection to the sneaker and youth culture that they share with their friends. Not just their friends in the classroom at school, but like-minded people they found through social media who could be anywhere in the world.","So we are continuing to invest judiciously in our store fleet. In some cases these are pinnacle locations, including four Foot Locker stores that we'll open in the next few weeks. In Rome this weekend, on Champs-Elysees in Paris next week, in Oslo, our first store in what will be our 24th country the week after, and finally, right before Christmas, a flagship store on Hollywood and Highland in L.A. that will feature another great SIX:02 shop in shop.","We have another set of strong stores across our banners that we believe will generate a significant sales lift through remodeling into our most current formats. We have engineered most of these remodels to be less expensive than in prior years, lowering the comp hurdle required to improve ROIC.","And while we will continue to close underperforming locations, our sales and even more important profit performance of those stores in relatively weaker malls and shopping centers have tended to hold up relatively well this year. Since most of these profitable doors already have low rents and short-term leases, it makes no sense to us to rush and close hundreds of them and leave the customers who still shop in them day in and day out without a clear choice for accessing the premium product we offer.","I want to close by saying that I hope what you take away from my comments this morning is that we are not in this game to get a ribbon for participation. We are in this game to win it. We are partnering with our vendors to win together in connecting emotionally with the customer, creating great experiences, and delivering innovative premium product when and where they want it.","We see our biggest vendor, Nike, on the verge of a major breakthrough in terms of product innovation and customer engagement, and, of course, we are working closely with them on that. Adidas, meanwhile, has certainly proven that they too can compete at the highest levels. We also have a number of other key suppliers that fill important roles in the athletic marketplace and we collaborate with them constantly on ideas big and small. Our position at the center of sneaker culture is strong, but not guaranteed or inevitable. We work hard every day in understanding what is influencing and motivating our customers that day, whether it be a global music icon, a young artist popular on social media, or rebuilding a playground in their neighborhood.","We intend to continue partnering with our vendors on this challenging, but exhilarating journey, making course adjustments as necessary, as we retain and build on our strong leadership positions in the athletic industry. Tommy, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.","One moment, please for our first question.","And we get our first question on the line from Kate McShane with Citi. Please go right ahead.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thank you, good morning.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Good morning, Kate.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","With regards to your CapEx spend, I know you said you're reallocating more to be on the digital side, but will there be any change to your longer term CapEx guidance that you've provided? Will it be increasing, or is it really just the shift away, or shift more into digital?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, there's no change to the guidance that we've given. We're allocating, according to the comments that we just made, a little bit more of it going to digital, stores still important, and obviously the supply chain investments as well.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then my bigger picture question is just on the relationship with Nike. They told us a lot a couple of weeks ago at their analyst day about how they're evolving the marketplace. It's clear that Foot Locker is one of the key partners based on what they said and what you have to highlight today. Could you maybe work through some of the three initiatives that Nike has in place with you, Sneakeasy and the Nike Pro in the stores, and what exactly it will mean in terms of how your stores look and how the relationship evolves over the next few years?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yeah, well, each of them is very different and unique, right? So Sneakeasy is a pop-up retail space, and while I'm not going to go into a lot of details because it's about discovery, and I can tell you that it will open up down at 30 Wall Street next week during the Week of Greatness. And it really is a look into the future of sneakers and how we will work with Nike. The format itself may or may not be a pop-up somewhere else, but it's really a view in how we want to digitally empower our consumers, draw them into a physical space, and have them interact with us and Nike, the Foot Locker and Nike brands together.","The Nike Pros in store is something that we're testing in the New York City market. In the holiday season, beginning next week with our Week of Greatness., it will put dedicated Nike resources in the store, our employees, but Nike experts in the store, to talk about the stories and the product in a little bit more depth to enhance the experience that the consumer will undoubtedly start from a digital perspective, but be able to make a great connection in store when they interact with the Pro, along with our stripers in store.","And then the third element was the player exclusives that were really one of the mainstays of the House of Hoops when we opened the House of Hoops 10 years ago. We'll start to see those returning to the House of Hoops as well, which again will add some excitement back to the basketball footwear assortment, specifically in House of Hoops as those player editions become available.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Kate.","Operator","Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from Robert Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, hey, guys.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Hi, Robby.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Actually, two questions, Dick. I think the first one, just the \u2013 I thought it was interesting that your ASPs are up. I think the overall industry may not be seeing that in footwear. Was there a mix shift that supported the ASPs even though there was a lot of discounting going on, or maybe mix away from kids, or just curious on what's driving that.","And then the second question is just in the press release, you mentioned the availability of premium product for holiday improving. What premium product wasn't available, and what are you getting? Maybe give us some insight on that. Thanks.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","I'll start with the ASPs, Robby. We talk a lot about our ASPs not being a simple function of plus this, minus that. It's across the families of business, size, scale, gender, and the mix mixed out, so it really is a change in mix that drove it. Again, we've got some great high-end product when you think about foamposites, when you think about VaporMax, when you think about Ultra Boost, but it's also across the range that we're seeing nice pops in some of our apparel pricing. So there's just a real complex model behind ASPs and it washed out positively, even given the markdowns. So again, I think our team did a great job of managing the markdowns while selling premium product.","When it comes to availability, we've talked about it all year that the availability of key silhouettes would become more \u2013 there would be more quantities available in the back half, specifically as we got into Q3 and Q4, later in Q3 and into Q4. So it's things like more quantities of VaporMax. It's the right quantities of Jordan retros. It's Ultra Boost and Yeezys in bigger quantities. So it's not that we didn't have availability, it's that the quantities have now started to ramp up a little bit more commercially in the marketplace, and we're getting access to those quantities that we need to drive the business from a commercial point of view.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's helpful. Hey, good luck in the holiday season.","<","A \u2013 [05HTYG-E Dick Johnson]>: Thank you, Robby.","Operator","Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank Research. Please go right ahead.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Help us understand your mindset on expenses. You clearly took some pretty meaningful steps this quarter to reduce cost, but you're also making investments for the long term around digital supply chain, the store fleet, the customer experience, as you spoke about. Just how should we think about the ability to leverage expenses over time, and SG&A growth rate, et cetera?","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, we described, I think, fairly thoroughly the reorganization and the positioning of ourselves to get out to those long-term growth opportunities to make sure that the organization is set up to do that. But as we evidenced in the third quarter, we really have very strong expense management culture, and we look for the opportunities to lever at lower comps. That leverage point has been mid-single digit comps for our structure this year.","But we look to manage cost sales per payroll hour. That's the biggest function within SG&A, selling wages. So we look to make sure that we have got the very best salespeople in the store at the peak hours, that management of scheduling is very important. And then we look to make sure that the marketing money that we spend is driving what we want it to, increased traffic and increased conversion.","But, Paul, we look at every lever. We manage our electricity through using things like LED bulbs because they're much more cost effective. Yeah, so every lever, but SPH and sales per square foot are obviously very meaningful.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","But as we said, we will continue to invest in the things that are going to allow us to be more agile and flexible, and that does include people, data analytics, supply chain \u2013 all of the things that we mentioned. But Lauren's right. We've got a culture of managing expenses tightly, and we'll continue to do that.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. And then some of the initiatives that you've announced with Nike obviously sound exciting. Just wondering if you can maybe spend some time talking about some of the partnerships and initiatives you have ongoing with some of the other brands, and maybe detail a bit how just the assortment on the shelves has been transforming a bit in terms of where customers are shaking out on trends today.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Paul, if you think about \u2013 and I know you get into our stores, but if you get into our Times Square and 34th Street store, you can see experiential spaces that we've worked on with Adidas, and the assortment and the storytelling, the connectivity of footwear and apparel in those faces is critical, and you can see that happening. The Legends Club with Timberland is another one that we look at and say, we bring in unique product into that space. Very seasonally driven at this point, but again, very strong statements about product and connectivity.","And most importantly, we work with our brand partners to create great social connectivity and great digital connectivity with our consumers that ultimately end up driving consumers into a physical experience with us. So we've got across our various banners, each banner has different relationships and different engagement opportunities with the consumers, and they work with all the various brands to create some excitement in store. So it's \u2013 some of it is physical space but a lot of it really is making sure that the engagement which we know is going to begin digitally is intriguing to the consumer, and it helps them move through their journey into a physical space in many cases to make their purchase.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks a lot. Best of luck.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you very much. We will get to our next question on the line from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please go right ahead.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you, good morning, everyone.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Good morning, Camilo.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I was hoping you could provide a little color as to where you think you are in the markdown and inventory clearance cycle and when you would expect to be in the right inventory position to begin expanding gross margins again. You have done a very good job of working down that inventory for the past two quarters, and obviously the commentary today on the fourth quarter expectations suggests that there's more work to be done there. I'm just trying to understand when you feel \u2013 when we can expect that, the balance of both better product, larger quantities of that better product, as well as diminishing the slower turning inventory will start to unfold so that you can get back on this gross margin expanding trend.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you for calling out what we have done on the inventory for the last couple of quarters because that is really the thought process to make sure that we are keeping the inventory fresh and that we have got capacity to bring in those improving assortments. So I \u2013 and I'm not going to get into expectations around 2018 at this point. It's a little bit premature. But we do believe that the actions that we're taking, we continue to take through the fourth quarter, will set us up well to come into 2018 with strong inventory.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","I think the adjunct to that, Camilo, is the customer is moving quickly, right? So the old marked down model will have to be adjusted a bit to respond. Actually, it's the whole buying model will have to be adjusted a bit to respond to that faster life cycle of product and effectively having a good, clean inventory to start that with is the place that we want to start as we head into 2018.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","And certainly the speed initiatives that our suppliers are working on and that we are partnering with them on are helpful to that formula and that expectation.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Do you feel that your receipts, incoming receipts over the next few weeks, over the next few months accurately represent where the demand is most vibrant?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Absolutely. I mean I'm a merchant at heart, Camilo, and you never buy a product that you don't like. So we believe that our team is aligned with where the customer is. We have worked hard with our vendor partners to get in position of bringing the right quantities, the right product and we like the way that the quarter lines up. As Lauren talked to, our expectation is a little bit better than it was when we were here a quarter ago. We are still not where we want to be, but I like the way our product lines up for the quarter.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And then, just the last one for me is could you just remind us when we should expect to lap the Stans and Superstar surge and when you can kind of get a better kind of inventory position on that particular category, considering it's had a big drag on the casual piece of your business?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yes, it's different in the markets, right? Europe was on the court classics from Adi before the US market was. So Europe is starting to lap it. The slowdown has definitely happened in our stores in the US and I would expect that we will start to see it get a little bit better Q2 of next year is really when the peak was and that we should be working down off that.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Perfect. Best of luck in the holiday. Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Camilo.","Operator","Thank you very much. We will get to our next question on the line from Scott Krasik of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes. Hey, everyone, nice job laying out everything you control. So that's important.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just wondering specifically around basketball, what do you think drove the improvement in the retro business? Was it just the stories that were told? Were there specific styles? And then in terms of the basketball go-forward how do you think about that until we start to lap the worst numbers in the sort of mid next year?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, it's a combination of a number of things, right? We all know that no two retros are created equally and that there is different storytelling that goes with them. And clearly in Q3, the stories and the retros that launched with the effective management of quantities in the marketplace led to higher pushes and better results. So I think that that bodes well as we think about Q4. The other piece is that we have seen some things like the LeBron 15, the LeBron Soldier, some Kyrie products, some Paul George product, a little bit of push in some places there that is slightly better than it's been. So, again, when the consumer sees the right price value relationship, when they see some excitement around the product in the storytelling, basketball shoes are certainly in high demand. But they have so many alternatives that everything has got to be right in that equation, the price value relationship, the storytelling, the digital connectivity, it all helps. So, we're going to continue obviously supporting basketball across a number of brands, and we see some excitement coming.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","No. That's great. And then, one of your peers gave specific guidance for next year to account for some of the investments. You laid out a handful of investments reorg initiatives. Just wondering how you sort of balance those investments plus some margin pressure probably early in the year and at least on a 52-week to 52-week basis, how you view next year's earnings growth right now.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yes, it's too early for us, Scott. We are in the middle of our planning process for next year and it has been our practice. We'll share much more detail about 2018 when we get to our end-of-year call in February. But our job is to balance that pressure. Our job is to figure out how and where and when to invest, and I feel comfortable and confident that the team has got that in mind as we lay out 2018.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Okay, thanks. Good luck.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question on the line from the line of Sam Poser with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go right ahead.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to follow up on the inventory. What percentage of the inventory still needs to be worked through to sort of get that residual underperforming inventory in the right place, so you can then open up more open-to-buy dollars to bring in the better products that's becoming available (48:12)","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yes, Sam, I'm not going to go into the detail of what those percentages look like. Just suffice to say that we have standards that we have in place at this organization, runs the business by to make sure that the inventory is in a good place. So, that has been a discipline that has served us well for years and we are sticking to that.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And I know you are not guiding 2018 yet, but I mean, is this situation \u2013 I mean, given the sort of way the comparisons work that there'll be \u2013 that we would expect some residual gross margin pressure probably into the first quarter of next year? Is that a fair way to think about it?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","We're merchants, Sam, as you know, and there's always gross margin pressure. Our team has done a great job of getting the inventory in good shape. If our sales expectations are met in Q4, we would see us ending the quarter with inventory in a strong position. Again, with the faster life cycle of product, I'm just not sure that the old markdown model will be as effective going forward. So, our team reads and reacts and adjusts quickly, utilizing all of the channels that we can to move through product that may become an issue. But there will continue, I believe, to be some gross margin pressure as we enter 2018.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. And just two more things. Number one, we're going in -we're anniversarying the 53rd week next year. And because of that, I think there's a big shift in between the last week of Q2 into Q3 as a big week of back-to-school shifts from Q3 to Q2, which would mean that in theory, your comp, a flat comp for the sake of argument, would give you very big \u2013 in Q2, would give you a very large increase and a flat comp in Q3, because of the shift sales would decrease, all other things being equal. Am I thinking about that correctly? Because, I mean, it's always very entertaining when we get to how the quarterly model for next year, for the year following the...","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yes, the 53rd week creates certainly some shifts, Sam. You've got that right. As we talked about, we'll give clearer guidance around 2018 when we get to our February call.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then lastly, outside of, let's say, the big five of Adidas, Nike, Puma, Under Armour, Timberland, let's say, New Balance arguably as well, what are you doing to test and grow new brands, brands that may have been on the back burner for a while? I noticed in windows in a couple stores you've got some Reebok Classics and so on. What are you doing there? And as we look into next year, are there a chance to, I would guess, commercialize them with yourselves in a greater way? And what are you looking from entering into new vendors, or old new vendors, or however you want to talk about it?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yes, the team has a test and try and react sort of mentality, Sam. And if you take a look in the stores today, brands like Champion on the apparel side, we've got a couple of banners that are testing, Fila on the footwear and apparel side. We've had a tremendous run with Vans and we think that there's more opportunity there.","So, each of the banners, because their use customer is a little bit different, each of them tests and tries different brands. And clearly, when you've got a division that has a number of stores across Europe, we get some insight from that as well. So, all of those brands that you named are critically important to us, yet we're testing and trying and looking to commercialize quickly some of these new old brands, or old new brands depending on how you want to look at it.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yes, thanks for the question, Sam. Dick has mentioned a couple times the next call being in February, but it currently is scheduled to be March 2.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Oh is that the 53rd week?","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yes, there you go. It shifts because of the 53rd week,","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Sorry about that.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","All right, next question, please.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you all very much.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll get to our next question on the line. It's on the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Please go right ahead.","Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks for taking my questions, and great job kind of laying out how you guys are evolving to the marketplace and the quick react and respond as you kind of right-size your cost structure. You're clearly attuned to what's going on in the marketplace. Can you talk a little bit about what's happening with some of these new limited edition sneaker launches? It feels like a lot of them are \u2013 a lot of the brands are using their own sneaker apps to launch some of these things. What's your take on this new development with that kind of core fashion-oriented sneakerhead consumer, and what Foot Locker's role will be in some of these digital launches, and how you see that evolving? Thanks.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yes, we know that our vendor partners have DTC objectives, right, and we know that the boutique sort of launches have been part of our industry for a long, long time. And our vendors utilizing their apps and some of the boutique partners is something that we certainly expect to continue. I think the group that I mentioned, our North American product and marketing strategy group that Andy Gray is going to lead, is working with each of our vendor partners to identify things that we can, in fact, take a bigger commercializable position in.","I think that those heat sort of launches that they do in their own apps and in the sneaker boutique stores, I think, are good for the industry, right? It adds heat, it adds excitement. So, as much as we want to participate, at some point, the truth is that it's a big ecosystem, and you need to bring heat into it to make sure that the consumer sees the excitement around sneakers that we believe is there every day. And we'll find a way to commercialize as we work with our vendor partners.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","But the connection of apps, releases by app, there's store connection as well. And this is an advantage for us, that we have a store fleet that can complement that experience. And our vendor partners appreciate that asset that we have.","Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC","Yes, understood. Agreed. Thanks very much. Good luck.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","Thank you very much. And we'll get to our next question on the line from Christopher Svezia from Wedbush Securities. Please go right ahead.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations in operating in a pretty tough environment. I guess, first, I just want to clarify just on the inventory, just so I understand this clearly and the commentary about better product that you're seeing in the marketplace right now. Against a more challenging gross margin expectations for Q4, is that just a function of your view that you want to go into 2018 as clean as possible? Or is it just a simple fact that still what's in the marketplace is potentially taking a little bit higher markdowns in order to actually move that product? I'm just trying to understand the dynamic between those two observations?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","It's a combination, right. We want to manage our inventory because that's really the only piece that we can control, right. We can't control what others do in the marketplace. We occasionally react to it, but our markdown strategy is based on our being competitive in the marketplace, making sure that we move through the product that we need to on a given season, so that we can enter the next season with the ability to flow in the best goods possible and chase goods if needed. So, it's really a combination. The marketplace is competitive. The marketplace is driven by markdowns. We stay focused and remain focused on being the premium retailer of athletic specialty shoes. So, the sneakers that we've got are going to be at the premium end. If we see something not selling to the expectations that we've got, we're certainly going to be aggressive with our markdowns to make sure that we move through the product.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And then, when you think about, as you step into next year, the All-Star game and the comments about basketball, the All-Stars in L.A. this year versus New Orleans last year, just how do you think about that in terms of how it could be a positive for the business just in general? Just overall thoughts on the year-over-year comparison, how we think about that?","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Well, simply the L.A. market versus NOLA is right, I mean, it's an easy comparison to say we think All-Star game will be better in 2018 than it was in 2017. But more importantly, the excitement that I believe is going to be generated out of basketball product in the marketplace in general, I think will be a positive. We've got plans in the works to activate, of course in the L.A. market put to work on activating basketball across the marketplace in our House of Hoops and across all of our geographies.","So, certainly, the impact of Los Angeles versus New Orleans should be a positive, but I would caution that with I expect that the tax check flow in 2018 will be similar to 2017, which is significantly different than it was in 2016. So, it's about timing of money in the market and product in the market to go along with the All-Star game.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. Lastly, just on Europe, I know you referenced Adi and Superstar, Stan Smith exposure. Anything else you can call out in terms of positive or negative that's impacting that region for you whether it's either other categories, it's just strictly traffic? Just any color on Europe and what's going on there would be helpful. Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","We talked about traffic being down mid singles in Europe and it's pretty spread across the continent and the UK. So, I don't know if it is the cumulative effect of some terrorist-type activities, some unrest. There's all sorts of things that go on in the various markets in Europe.","Running continues to be the most important category there. The core product that you mentioned in Adidas, Superstars and Stan Smiths have slowed down, but our team continues to reinvest into some great running platforms. And while we've seen negative comps for a few quarters, I have a lot of confidence in our team there to be able to turn it around and get positive.","Christopher Svezia - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And all the best around the holidays to you, guys.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","All right, Tommy, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. We'll get to our next question on the line from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities. Please go right ahead.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Two quick questions. I think the first one is you guys were pretty aggressive around the share buyback this most recent quarter. Just give us an update in terms of where you are with the program and how you're approaching it going forward. And the second one is I think you mentioned shared inventory proposition with some of your vendors. Dick, I wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more how that would work and sort of how long it would take to get to such an initiative.","Lauren B. Peters - Foot Locker, Inc.","Yes, on the share buyback, we ended the third quarter with the remaining $863 million of our original $1.2 billion authorization. So, the share buyback is not a formulaic, it is \u2013 our number one priority is investing in the business, but a very important objective is meaningful returns cash to the shareholders and certainly, we've demonstrated that this year. But where we see value, we act appropriately.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","And in the shared inventory comment, Bob, I didn't comment about shared inventory with our vendor partners as of yet, but it's something that we're certainly looking to explore and figure out how we can make the inventory and the sneaker ecosystem more productive. My commentary was around better access across our portfolio of brands and banners. So, better utilization of our own supply chain to make sure that all of our inventory is available and visible to our consumers, and that we can deliver it to them as quickly and efficiently as possible.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","John A. Maurer - Foot Locker, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - Foot Locker, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","John A.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John Maurer","Thank you, Suzan and good morning to you all. Welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s Second Quarter earnings conference call. Extending the momentum with which the company started off the year, Foot Locker generated a 9.6% comparable sales gain in the second quarter and we were able to flow a very strong proportion of those sales to the bottom line producing record net income of a $119 million, a 29% increase over the second quarter last year. On a per share basis Q2 earnings were $0.84, a 33% improvement on last year's GAAP results of $0.63 and 31% above last year's non-GAAP earnings of $0.64 per share. For the first six months of the year the company has generated net income of 303 million, the most profitable first half results in our history. We have earned $2.14 per share so far in 2015, a 24% increase on a GAAP basis over the same period in 2014.","Here this morning to provide you with the details of our second quarter performance is Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, she\u2019ll be followed by Dick Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer who will highlight the product trends, that drove our results this quarter and delve into the execution of the strategic priorities which are behind the record levels of success we have achieved so far this year. After Dick's prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to your questions. So, Lauren, begin.","Lauren Peters","Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. We are encouraged by the continued strong execution of our business initiatives in the second quarter which led to this record financial performance. We had consistently robust operating results across our channels, geographies, banners, families of business and product categories leading to the strong gross margin rate, a low expense rate and improved inventory position. But it all starts with top line sales, so let's begin there.","By segment our comparable sales gain in our stores was 8.6% while our direct-to-customer business again led our performance with an 18.8% sales increase. Within the direct-to-customer segment, the domestic store banner.com businesses collectively increased sales more than 40%. While Eastbay generated a mid-single digit increase. Overall, direct-to-customer sales increased to 11.3% of total sales, up from 10.5% a year ago.","Within our store businesses our international divisions produced the strongest sales results with all regions Europe, Canada and Asia Pacific posting double-digit comparable sales increases. We had good performances in the U.S. as well with the Foot Locker and Footaction divisions both up high-single digit.","Kids Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 were both up mid-single digit and Champs Sports produced a low-single digit comparable sales gain. For Lady Foot Locker it was its fifth consecutive quarterly comparable sales increase and its first positive comp on top of a prior year comp gain in quite some time.","Due to significantly weaker foreign currency's this year, our 9.6% overall comparable sales gain translated into a 3.3% overall sales increase. Similar to the first quarter reported sales were reduced by more than $100 million in Q2 due to impact of weaker FX rates this year compared to rates in effect a year ago. Footwear was once again the strongest category posting a low-double digit sales increase and our apparel business improved significantly, posting a mid-single digit sales increase.","Overall, our stock's good sales were up low-single digit due to certain accessory categories which faced difficult comps. Within Footwear running and basketball both posted a double-digit increase, in fact in a testament to the current broad based and consistent strength of our business each major region posted a double-digit sales increase in both basketball and running footwear.","Comparable sales with Kids and Women\u2019s footwear were also up double digits. Men's footwear sales came close up high-single digits. By a month our comp sales cadence was up low-double digits in May and up high-single digits in both June and July. As in the first quarter we were able to lever these strong sales to improved gross margin this quarter by 60 basis points to 32.6% of sales from 32% a year ago. Also similar to the first quarter our merchandize margin rate improved 20 basis points on a constant currency basis, with a lower mark down rate partially offset by a lower initial markup rate, but FX negatively impacted margin by 20 basis points. Thus the overall gross margin gain was primarily the result of leveraging the fixed rent and salary elements within our cost of sales. I am particularly pleased that we were able to improve our SG&A expense rate by 140 basis points to 19.5% of sales from 20.9% last year. Through disciplined expense management across our entire organization we successfully levered our operating costs and with the help of weaker foreign currencies achieved a 3.5% decrease in recorded SG&A dollars.","The rest of the income statement depreciation, interest and income tax expense came in very close to our expectations going into the quarter. Continuing our trend of solid inventory management we ended the quarter with inventory down 1.3% from a year ago compared to a sales increase of 3.3%. Inventory increased just over 3% on a constant currency basis compared to 9.9% total sales increase on the same basis. As a consequence of this excellent inventory performance, our inventory return is tantalizingly close to our goal of return. Come year-end I am hoping to be able to celebrate the achievement of that goal. The only one of our goals originally set in 2010 that we haven\u2019t yet reached. The rest of our balance sheet was also strong at quarter end with cash standing at 970 million, up $13 million from a year ago.","We spent $58 million on capital expenditures in the second quarter bringing our year-to-date total to 118 million. A significant portion of the capital has been invested as planned on enhancing our store fleet including a combination of new stores, the largest number of which continues to be in Kids Foot Locker and remodel projects. With activity spread across most of our banners and regions. Many of these projects include a partnership space with Nike, Jordan, Adidas, Under Armour or PUMA. We also continue to invest in our digital capabilities within the United States and internationally, where we operate e-commerce sites in 10 countries.","For example we significantly upgraded our digital platform in Europe during Q2 bringing together best practices from Foot Locker Europe in the Netherlands, the Runners Point team in Germany and our global center of excellence in Wausau, Wisconsin where our U.S. digital operations are headquartered. While investing in our business to drive future growth, we are continue to return cash to our shareholders between spending $76 million to repurchase almost 1.2 million shares and our $0.25 quarterly dividends, we returned a $111 million to our shareholders in the second quarter. In the first half of the year, we returned $275 million of cash to our shareholders. Overall traffic was up slightly in our stores during the quarter with our international division seeing stronger trends than the U.S.","We believe the geographic traffic differences have a lot to do with a much stronger dollar compared to a year ago, which has led to less tourist traffic in the U.S. Average selling prices were up again in the quarter in line with recent trends and conversion also improved due to the effectiveness of our marketing program, the investments we are making in training our associates and of course the great product our vendors continue to deliver. Looking ahead to the back half of the year, we see an ongoing flow of exciting products to support our back-to-school business and the holiday. Nonetheless we will continue to plan the business cautiously because we\u2019ve learned that disciplined planning ensures that our inventory and our expense structure stay in line. The metaphor we use around here is that we don\u2019t want to get ahead of our skis. So mid-single digit comps remains our mantra and in fact our comparable sales months-to-date are up mid-single digit.","With the later start of back-to-school this year, we do believe that there is a good chance for sales to be at the strong end of mid-single digits, both this quarter and over the second half of the year. We continue to believe double-digit EPS sales in Q3 and Q4 are achievable based on current sales trends. One update to the back half that I will mention is an increase of $15 million in our 2015 capital expenditures to $235 million which our Board approved this week. This increase primarily relates to the move of our New York headquarters a couple of blocks down 34th Street. We\u2019re getting underway on building up the new space with a physical staff relocations slated for April next year. The project also involves a significant reconfiguration of our flagship Foot Locker stores that is downstairs from our current offices.","Let me now turn the call over to Dick to give you more of the product details behind our results and more broadly review how we\u2019re doing in executing our updated strategic priorities.","Dick Johnson","Thanks, Lauren, and good morning. It\u2019s great to have all of you with us this morning to hear about what drove our second quarter results. One of the things we try to do at Foot Locker, Inc. is to always keep looking forward at what we can do better and how we can build the future performance of the business to be even strong. But it is appropriate every so often to pause and acknowledge the successes the team has achieved. And with the quarter we just announced, now is one of those times because it really was an outstanding quarter and first half of the year.","I want to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to all of our associates in all of our divisions and support facilities around the world for the team work, innovation and excellence that are clearly evident in our results so far this year. In fact, I truly appreciate how firmly these and our other core values have been embraced by the entire team at Foot Locker, Inc. That said we realize retail is a game that never really ends. And for 2015, we\u2019re just starting the second half, so we recognize the hard work still to be done to finish the year on top.","Turning to the product highlights in the second quarter, there are quite some works from recent quarters. Lauren already mentioned that both Running and Basketball were up double digits. In terms of Running, lifestyle running continued to be a big driver of our Footwear business in all of our regions, led by Roshe, Huarache, and Air Max Styles from Nike, and ZX Flux from Adidas. Although those are the really big running platforms we are also working with other vendors to develop new lifestyle running offerings, including Puma, New Balance, Asics and Saucony.","On the basketball side, Jordan continues to be tremendously strong brand around the globe. Jordan Retros and Classics in particular performed well. Meanwhile, the Marquee Player shoe business in the U.S. continued to grow with ongoing strength in Lebron, KB and Kobe coupled with stellar growth in the footwear sales of exciting new athletes, in particular Kyrie Irving with Nike and Stephen Curry with Under Armour. The softer part of our footwear business continued to be in casual. In particular, canvas and vulcanized shoes.","On the other hand, the launch of the new Chuck Taylor IIs from Converse performed quite well recently, indicating that when there is some new or different casual product in our business, our customers know to come to us to find it. Although seasonally a small business, we brought in some of our boot assortment from Timberland and Nike earlier this year and the initial sell throughs were positive which bodes well for back to school in the fall of season.","There were abundant signs of progress in our apparel business during the quarter. Apparel was up solidly at Foot Locker and Footaction in the U.S. where it was primarily a bottoms driven store with Nike and Jordan Shorts posting strong sales, as well as Tiro pants from Adidas. At Footaction, jogger bottoms from smaller lifestyle brands also sold well keeping that banner on the forefront of style for its core customer.","Branded tech fleece pants and shorts sold well in Europe where our apparel business continued its rebound with a double digit comp gain. Europe\u2019s private label and control brands gained ground in shorts and tees and our soccer business continued to develop into a more meaningful part of our apparel assortment there.","Finally, while posting a top plus the apparel business at Champs Sports also improved sequentially, driven by the same branded bottoms trends as in our other U.S. divisions as well as its private label Champs Sports gear, mid shorts and jogger pants. The losses are still coming primarily from downsizing what has been a very sizeable licensed business.","I\u2019ll touch briefly now on our key strategic initiatives. First, clearly the core business remains strong with strong connections to the different core customers of the Footlocker, Champs Sports and Footaction banners. We are continuing to invest in the remodel programs and expect to have touched at least 30% of the Champs stores and our Foot Locker fleece in the U.S. by the end of 2015. And where we will begin to catch up at Footaction as we move into the rollout more with the Garden State Plaza design in that banner.","We are continuing to develop and rollout our vendor partnership spaces such as House of Hoops of which we now have a 165 in the U.S. and another 25 internationally. Also at Footlocker we now have five PUMA Labs and at Footaction we have four Jordan Flight 23 shops with another one slated to open on State Street in Chicago next month. Our latest partnership the ARMOURY @ Champs Sports is just a couple of months old and the first store is doing well. It\u2019s too early to say much about it other than the fact that we and Under Armour are both learning from that store and we\u2019re discussing an expansion of the test at some point next year.","Our Kids business remains robust, just as in the first quarter. The Kids Foot Locker division posted a mid-single digit comparable sales gain with the addition of 20 new KFL stores, total sales at KFL were up double-digits. We are continuing to rollout Fly Zones in partnership with Nike, we're up to almost 30 now. Meanwhile, Kids Footwear sales in the other banners were up double-digits and we continue to add Kids Foot Locker stores in other market outside the U.S.","With so many strong performances, it's impossible for us to pick an MVP for the quarter. But Foot Locker Europe would certainly have been -- have to be the finals. That division posted outstanding sales and profit growth in Q2 with a comp gain in footwear in mid-teens and apparel up double-digits. Sales in all of these big six countries were up double-digits. Although it is one of our smallest markets with only four stores even Greece had a comparable sales gain for the quarter.","Our banner segmentation work is continuing in Germany as we position the Runners Point and Sidestep banners to complement our position with Foot Locker banner in that country. It's still premature to draw firm conclusions from that work. We'll be able to give you a better idea of a potential banner expansion strategy towards the end of the year when we\u2019ve gathered more experience executing in a multi banner offence in Germany and have developed our capital plans for 2016 and beyond.","At the same time, we're reviewing expansion opportunities for the Foot Locker banner in Europe and may look to accelerate somewhat our store growth plans, especially in the markets we believe we\u2019re most under penetrated in such as France and Spain.","We\u2019ve already covered a lot of the story behind our next growth pillar, apparel, which is definitely improving. However you also heard today that our growth in footwear is even faster. As a result apparel penetration is currently still falling a bit. But let's just say I\u2019m not telling the footwear teams to slow down so that their apparel partners can catch up.","As we've said gains in apparel penetration will take time, but apparel profitability can strengthen with comp increases and improving margins and that's what we're beginning to see. Our next strategic initiative to build a more powerful digital business remains firmly on track, with steady high-teens sales increases with strong margins our digital performance sometimes almost seems automatic, but having come from and led that business I know how much really hard work goes into producing such consistently strong results. It takes a lot of technology investments, product and marketing coordination with our store teams, analysis of massive amounts of data and outstanding customer service to be a leader in the omni-channel world. And we\u2019ve continued to be just that. And since beginning given that omni-channel world, we've doubled the size of tests, of the Eastbay performance zones in Champs Sports.","We now have eight Champs locations where we feature a select performance merchandize from Eastbay, previously a digital only banner. The assortments include both seasonal sports specific merchandize and an ongoing presentation of categories such as training that are in the performance zone all year along.","Now, turning to our women's business, we recorded our fifth consecutive comparable sale gains at Lady Foot Locker SIX:02. An achievement not seen in almost a decade. With the 205 store fleets, still being approximately 90% Lady Foot Locker and 10% SIX:02, the gains are still being driven primarily by Lady Foot Locker. Apparel was up high-single digits in Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 led by Nike, Adidas and Under Armour, but with other brands such as Alala, Koral and Lorne Jane expanding in to additional stores.","Lifestyle running footwear from Nike and Adidas was another key source of strength, while performance brands such as Asics and Brooks are still a meaningful part of these assortments for her. Reebok is also beginning to gain some traction in classic running shoes and apparel. We continue to build awareness for the SIX:02 banner and refined the formula to maximize our potential to succeed with, it is our primary women's banner in the future. As with Runners Point, I\u2019d say that we are going to spend the rest of the year to read the results of our work building SIX:02's position in the market and we\u2019ll use the insight from that to develop our future capital plans. At this point, it's too early to provide a meaningful update about what the growth trajectory for SIX:02 look like after this year which we expect to end with over 30 stores.","Finally, the women's business in our other banners continues to be strong with double-digit footwear gains in Foot Locker and Champs Sports in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. ","Let me wrap up my prepared remarks as Lauren did by focusing a bit on the future. We certainly intend to continue building on many of our strengths, one of which is the remarkable consistency of our performance across channels, banners, geography, genders and categories. However at every strategy session, in fact at virtually every meeting we are also trained to take the time to look at what didn't work as well as we'd hope, where we could have done better and what completely new development opportunities there might be for us.","New Ideas come out of almost every such exercise some of which like House of Hoops are now core to our business, others of which -- well let me just say some ideas are best put back on the shelf for another day. There are great partnerships and relationships with all of our vendors and I know we will continue to push each other to find additional ways to succeed together. We also believe that the casualization of our customer base is here to stay and that this trend will expand overtime geographically and by age, providing our business of selling athletically inspired footwear and apparel with potential tailwinds for the foreseeable future. Thank you.","Let's go ahead now and open the call to your questions, Susan?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from the line of Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Camilo Lyon","The first question I had Lauren you talked about the IMU trend improving, I think you also said that last quarter. And could you just talk a little bit about what the -- if you peel back the layers, what\u2019s going on there? Is it more of a mix benefit that you're seeing or are you seeing something different there that\u2019s improving your positioning with respect to the vendors?","Lauren Peters","Camilo, what I talked about was the fact that our merchandise margins improved during the quarter, they were up about 20 basis points, which was a combination of us further reducing markdowns and that offsetting a bit of continued IMU pressure. But the IMU pressure has progressively lessened and really where it comes from, the IMU pressure is the mix, it was really a mix situation, mix of vendor, mix of products category. But we remained focused on our opportunities to -- ever get the products allocated better the first time around that helps with the further lowering markdowns. And certainly as we continue to see progress in our apparels business and its profitability that as well.","Camilo Lyon","And then my second question relates to inventory. You're clearly managing your inventory very well, it looks -- you're guiding to a mid-single-digit comp. It looks like you're being very cautious on how you're planning the business, which if we are looking at this from the perspective of your demand trends, does it feel like you're leaving some sales on the table by not being a little bit more aggressive on your inventory buys or you're feeling that you're capturing all of the demand that you're seeing walk through the door?","Dick Johnson","Camilo, I don\u2019t think we capture all of the demand that walks through the door, but I think that the team has done a great job of effectively managing the inventory. We do plan conservatively, but we chase aggressively. So when we have the opportunity and see the opportunity to move a little bit fast on the inventory front we work with our vendors to identify those opportunities, our team goes aggressively after that. So I think that one of the things that\u2019s driven our productivity across the board is effective inventory management. I think getting the right product in the right store at the right time is the key, I think our team together with Lauren and her planning skills are getting that done.","Camilo Lyon","So is that to say you\u2019re able to get more product intra-quarter now than you were in the past, you're able to chase more successfully now than you have been in the past?","Dick Johnson","We\u2019re able to chase more successfully and we\u2019re flowing inventory better. So the combination of those two I think really puts us in a position to capture the demand as it walks through the door. We\u2019re also doing a better job of looking at our inventory in totality across stores, across channel, so we have the ability to satisfy the customer wherever they happen to be shopping today.","Lauren Peters","We work very hard internally and with our vendor partners to be as nimble as possible on inventory flow.","Camilo Lyon","And this is on the floor that systems initiatives come into play which should further the margin outlook and the full price sales outlook as those systems come online next year, correct?","Dick Johnson","Well we\u2019ve got the first phase of our merchandise planning system -- our merchandise allocation system in place. So it's a learning system. So as that system goes through season after season, it continues to learn more, we will continue to see more improvement. We\u2019ll also get improvement as we get the second phase of that system in place starting later this year and rolling into 2016.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Krasik","Just one clarification and then a bigger picture question. When you talked about casual, obviously there is laggard. Where do you guys put things like the Jordan Eclipse and Roche for example because I see a lot of people wearing that for casual wear? And then just bigger picture, it sounded to me like there might be a little bit more momentum coming from some of your secondary brands. And do you feel like this is sustainable and we can start to see really increased penetration from some of the brands that have lost share or were too small to matter in the past?","Dick Johnson","Most of the shoes that we sell are technically used for casual use, we\u2019ve talked about before, they\u2019re not being -- every running shoe that we sell certainly doesn\u2019t see the track or the road to run miles in. Every basketball shoe sold doesn\u2019t see the court to play game of Hoops so when we refer to casual, we refer to vulcanized and canvas sort of products and that\u2019s really where the challenge has been through the quarter.","Roche by our definition is a running silhouette, it\u2019s a casual lifestyle running silhouette, but certainly a running silhouette, the future, our Jordan product is generally categorized as basketball. So when we refer to casual it\u2019s more of the vulcanized canvas shoe and while we\u2019re experiencing some struggles the Chuck II that launched late in the quarter certainly has performed better than the rest of the category.","Scott Krasik","And they didn\u2019t turn to the other brands, sorry?","Dick Johnson","In terms of the momentum of the secondary brands, we work with a number of brands trying to development programs and platforms that are right for each of our banners. So you won\u2019t necessarily see some of these secondary brands across all of the banners that we\u2019ve got. But the Footaction team is working on some specific programs with some of them, the Footlocker team is working on programs with some of them, Champs is working on programs with some of them. So yes we think there is definitely a place for the secondary brands in our assortment and we continue to work with them to grow the opportunities.","Scott Krasik","And then just did you actually give the RPG comps?","Dick Johnson","No.","Lauren Peters","We did not, since we\u2019ve Anniversary the acquisition we really speak in terms of Euro regions.","Scott Krasik","Is it meaningfully different, do you want to throw that out, or?","Lauren Peters","We aren\u2019t going to break that out, which sparingly estimate RPGs contribution to our results, it is accretive for us and we\u2019re working through the segmentation in Germany and how that position Foot Locker, Runners Point and Sidestep to reach the broadest demographics that we can. And we feel very good about the progress that we\u2019ve made in particular with the Runners Point which is really all things running and they\u2019re positioning on Sidestep further behind that effort in Runners Point.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Mark McClintock with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Matthew McClintock","I was just wondering if you could elaborate on your comments regarding 602. You talked about refining the formula, I know that there has been a lot of work regarding that over the last several years, while at the test it seems like now you\u2019re starting to get to a point where you\u2019re rolling that concept out more, you\u2019re accelerating that. How do you think about refining that formula? And specifically, when we talk about additional brands, like Lorna Jane, et cetera, how do you think about allocation of space to those brands in the current prototype in terms of size of the stores, so the store should -- so should we be looking at bigger stores going forward? Thank you.","Dick Johnson","Well, that\u2019s part of the things that we\u2019re evaluating, Matt. We started with slightly bigger stores in 602. We\u2019re trying to strike the right balance of floor space and productivity. The secondary brands are key to the look and style with the core consumer wants there. So the mix of footwear and apparel, the mix of brands within footwear and apparel remain items that we continue to evaluate. And we were just out in Chicago in Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, relatively new 602 there that looked good and we see the strength of the brand. Our real initiative is evaluating the performance metrics in the doors and growing the brand recognition in the marketplace at the same time.","Lauren Peters","And actually that customer is clearly telling us she wants the specialty retail. We are working on the assortment to make sure that we deliver that to her.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jay Sole","Dick you\u2019re talking about apparels, seems like there has been some real progress in the quarter. Can you talk about why that\u2019s happening now, some of the nuances behind that business that are causing the improvement that you\u2019re seeing?","Dick Johnson","The teams done a great job of narrowing the assortment identifying key items and driving them hard, we\u2019re in a very bottoms driven assortment time in the U.S. and our team has done a really good job of identifying the key bottoms, the key fabrications, the key styles and they\u2019re driving those silhouettes. In the Europe it\u2019s been a combination of strong branded performance, their private label and their own so controlled brands have been strong and they've really reintroduced lifestyle of soccer into the program in Europe which has been a very much a positives.","So, I think it's really been an assortment of or a combination, excuse me, of -- we're finding these assortment going after the key items in depth and moving on, we've got a better markdown cadence, we've got a better freshness ratio, so they've taken the bull by the horns on the apparel front and are really making some differences. The business of Champs across the branded and private label side of the business is improving. They're still trying to rationalize their licensed product business which over time had become a very big chunk of their apparel business and as they start the anniversary that process of lowering their percentage of licensed products we see the branded and private label in Champs taking over and them getting positive by the end of the year as well.","Jay Sole","At the end of the statement, you were talking about some initiatives to continue to improving apparel, where do you stand on those and what's the next step of the next 90 days? What would you like to see happen in just terms of the operations to continue to drive strong apparel comps?","Dick Johnson","More continuity of the same things they just really identified Jay, in terms of identifying those strong apparel trends and items, making sure that we maximize those, we create complimentary adjacencies for footwear and apparel, that we're always bringing apparels to the bench to try to add-on the sale, that we're creating exciting strong environments where apparel will be featured and can be talked about our associates on the floors. So the things that we just started and we're seeing nice bounce from the great work that they're doing, we're just going to get more ingrained in that. That\u2019s the next step of the continuity.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Sam Poser with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Sam Poser","What is -- what if you talked a little bit about the impact of the later Labor Day from the short term and I wondered if there was some other launch changes as well as regarding Nike, given the later Labor Day at Jordan, if you're seeing any of that?","Dick Johnson","Well, Sam, we know that the launch calendar shifts and ebbs and flows based on the timing of the various launches, but right now the bigger impact is probably the later back to school -- with the late labor day and you have to remember too that we\u2019ve got a lot of geography differences when it comes to Western Europe, their back to school cadence is significantly different than it is here in the U.S. So the back to school period is really getting to be more like the Christmas period and we have to look at it across the six or seven weeks where various regions of this country and various regions of our Western European business, our Canadian business do go back to school.","Sam Poser","So, you haven't seen any change -- I mean you see no changes in the momentum of the categories or anything really -- I mean you consider you see the strength or are you seeing any changes in categories right now as we've moved into back to school?","Dick Johnson","We probably outta, Sam, when we look at footwear especially, both running and basketball were up double-digits for the quarter. And across the major geographies so while basketball still has bigger percentage of the business here in U.S. certainly, running is -- the key still is running in Western Europe, but basketball is growing significantly, there while running is growing significantly here. So at this point no, the momentum is clearly there on the footwear side and in the progress we're seeing in apparel, we continue to see some tailwind in the sales right now.","Sam Poser","And then, I know the question was answered, but can you give us a little bit of color -- can you give us any more color on what you're seeing from Runners Point group, Sidestep and so on, and sort of how you're looking at that? We were looking forward to hearing a little more color once it hit the comp and so just love to discuss as much as you can give us.","Dick Johnson","The work that we\u2019re doing -- Bart and his team working with Lou and his team over in Europe are really designed to give us a ready to run a multi banner offence across Western Europe, so solidifying the position with Runners Point as all things running and Sidestep being more on the lifestyle side of the equation, the complemented position that we've got with Foot Locker is ongoing work. When we took Timberland boots and Chuck Taylors out of Runners Points we fired some customers, so now we're rehiring customers with technical and lifestyle running and really creating an environment that is part of the Runners Point DNA, which is really where they started, as a technical specialty running shop. In Western Europe, that business is able to be successful both on the high streets and in the malls.","So we've launched a lighthouse store in Cologne and we've got a second plan to expand the lighthouse bought into Vienna in Austria that would be the first country that we move into outside of Germany in a significant way. So the progress continues and the positioning continues, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll take some time to get the multi-banner offence up and running, but as Lauren said, Runner Points group business continues to be accretive to us and we\u2019re pleased with the results at this point and are very happy that the acquisition is behind us and the integration continues.","Sam Poser","And then lastly, could you just give us -- you said that the -- I mean on the scale of one to 10 like where are you with sort of the impact of the allocation system -- the new allocation system that\u2019s been put in, I know you mentioned there was a learning system. Maybe you can provide a little more color there?","Dick Johnson","Yes, as the first phase of the project, Sam, is completely installed. So the learning piece of it is out there and it\u2019s helping us to allocate products into the stores today, we\u2019ve changed the process that we used. So we hold a little more inventory back in the warehouse and then we replenish to the stores that have the best opportunity from the systems perspective, of course with human monitoring, the best opportunity to sell that product. The second phase were that knowledge is part of the order planning system, that\u2019s the piece that we\u2019ve rollout later this year. So we\u2019ll continue to get better in the allocation and flow of product into the stores initially, we\u2019ll continue to get better with the replenishment of the product into the right stores, which again helps us lower the markdowns and increase the opportunity to sell to the right customer in the store.","And then we\u2019ll get more informed order writing as we go onto \u201816 and \u201817. So the system will always learn, the first round of learning is probably the lengthiest as it goes through a full cycle with us. But it will continue to learn and we\u2019ll be able to take continued advantage of the installation of the system.","Lauren Peters","We think it bears fruit for several years.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","So given your strong gross margin performance in the first-half of the year, any change to the flat to slightly positive full year outlook and then just the best way to think about second half headwinds and tailwinds?","Lauren Peters","Yes, so we really have done a good job of flowing through the sales gains above the mid-single-digit plan and comp first-half 8-7 [ph] and when we\u2019re able to do that, we\u2019re really able to lever the fixed element of the margin and as I\u2019ve already described we actually improved the merchandise margin. So as we look at the back half planning mid-single, but if we\u2019re able to come in at the high end of that range there is no reason to think that we couldn\u2019t continue to lever those fixed elements.","So 40 to 50 leverage basis points in the back half is not out of question. And then we have the tailwinds, headwinds, we\u2019ve talked a lot about product strength and what we\u2019re seeing coming from products, we still got the FX that we\u2019re dealing with as the headwind. Although that begins to get a bit better the further into the back half we go. As we look at third quarter, it should be less than 100 on the top-line, but I\u2019d think about, 80 to 100. It\u2019s probably about a nickel on the bottom-line for Q3. And then I guess it gets better than that in Q4.","Matthew Boss","And then just touching back on that FX in the expense base, what\u2019s the best way to think about expense dollar growth in the back half of the year. Can dollars continue to be down in SG&A and then going forward just any change to the lower single-digit comp leverage point or is that kind of the best way to think about it multi-year? Just any investments for us to consider as we think beyond this year?","Lauren Peters","We continue to see that we can lever at low single-digit comps. But on the SG&A certainly we\u2019ve got a benefit in the first-half from the FX as you look at the dollar impact that as I described lessens as you get further into the back half. But we did do some shifting of marketing expense into the back half to make sure that we were really telling our story during the peak of selling periods. So in terms of SG&A I would continue stick with the guidance that we gave earlier of about 50 basis points over the back half of improvement.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matthew Plank with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Eddie Plank","It's Eddies by the way. I guess, Dick, on the Kids business it\u2019s been strong for a several years now. How do you feel about the runway left there, how much is the global opportunity factor in, in just sustaining that strength at this point?","Dick Johnson","The Kids business has really been one of the shining stars that we\u2019ve had amongst many, Eddie. And the opportunity to grow that banner exists both in the U.S. where we continue to add some KFL stores and in our international market as well. So we see continued upside there. Obviously, as we open some partnership spaces, the fly-zones have been extraordinarily well received in this country. We\u2019re looking at that partnership space in Canada and in Western Europe as well. So, we think there is still upside on the kids business. And that\u2019s just the KFL banner, Eddie, when you think about our kids business across the other banners where we sell it that was up double digits in the quarter. So we continue to see opportunity on the kid side.","Eddie Plank","And then just you touched on the Under Armour shop-in-shop concept at Champs. Maybe it\u2019s early to ask this question, but do you see any -- are you talking about any scalability there to the other banners. You\u2019ve got the shop-in-shops with the PUMA Lab and the Adidas shop-in-shops. I mean I guess how do we think about Under Armour as a factor in that going forward?","Dick Johnson","We see Under Armour as a player across several of our banners. The partnership space right the Armoury is clearly focused on the Champs Sports customer and we have to figure out the scale with Under Armour, we have to figure out the scalability of it with the Champs banner. But several of our banners are working hard with Under Armour to continue to drive product opportunities. We think Under Armour will play a significant role in our women\u2019s business, for example, they\u2019ve got some great assets with Gisele, Misty Copeland, people that have real resonance with our female consumers. So we see them having a big impact in the business going forward across banners.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Erinn Murphy","I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about Europe, I think you talked about accelerating your store growth plans there. Can you just elaborate what regions you\u2019re going to really be focused on? And then I know JD Sports has been very aggressive in the store rollout plans there. So, just how are you viewing your move in terms of being defensive versus offensive at this point? Thanks.","Dick Johnson","Well, we always play offense and I mean that\u2019s the fun side of the game. So we look at Western Europe with over 600 Foot Locker stores, couple hundred stores in the Runners Point Group in Germany. And the multi-banner offering presents us great opportunities across the other countries, and that\u2019s why the work that we\u2019re doing with Runners Point and Sidestep is so critical in terms of complementing the Foot Locker business across the Western Europe Theater. So the places that we\u2019ve talk specifically about, we feel like we\u2019re a little bit under penetrated in a couple of the big six countries, France and Spain, specifically. So, we think there is an opportunity to expand our Foot Locker stores there. And as we get ready to roll out the multi-banner offence we see -- frankly most of the Western European countries that we\u2019re doing business in has an opportunity to run that multi-banner offence.","Erinn Murphy","And I guess with JD Sports in particular, are there any other competitors, other than them, that you\u2019re seeing as pretty significant in terms of how they are kind of thinking about their store allocations, or store rollout plans?","Dick Johnson","There is competitors Erinn in each country, JD\u2019s is probably been the most aggressive going cross-country borders, moving more into under the continent from the UK. But there is competitors that have -- clearly have plans to expand in most of the countries that we do business in. So we look at Western Europe in totality, but the team over there really focuses on specific markets and identifies great opportunities to open stores. So, we look at it from an offensive point of view and that\u2019s every country that we do business in.","Lauren Peters","This is one of our real strengths that we\u2019re very focused on the local customer and what their product preferences are and we\u2019ve got a rich history in being able to do that. So, it is a competitive advantage for us.","Erinn Murphy","When you talked earlier on in the call just about the strength you\u2019re seeing in running, and you talked about some of the other brands like PUMA, New Balance, Asics, Saucony. I didn\u2019t hear you talking about Under Armour from a running perspective. How is that brand doing within running, in particular?","Dick Johnson","The running products is certainly advancing Erinn. And the call out that I made was more along the lifestyle side of running. But the shoes that Under Armour is bringing to bear on the running side of the house certainly have gotten better over the last couple of seasons and we see continued progress there. And we think that both on the running and basketball, and ultimately on the training side as well, that their footwear is improving.","Erinn Murphy","And then just last question, just housekeeping on the model for the back half. You bought back a little bit less stock in the second quarter versus the first quarter. How are you thinking about buyback activity in the second half and just what\u2019s included in your guidance? Thank you.","Lauren Peters","We have 851 million still open in our operations program and we\u2019re executing against that. I don\u2019t have a formula that I can share with you. So we really look at our capital structure across for opportunities to invest in the business and return to shareholders, and I think we\u2019ve done a good job of doing both.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Kate McShane","My question was on apparel as well, you had mentioned that the profitability is improving despite the fact that the penetration is still declining a little bit just based on the strength of footwear, can you quantify at all, how the gap in profitability has improved for apparel over the last couple of quarters and what your expectation is for that gap, through year end?","Lauren Peters","It's a case where we have been improving the margins in both footwear and apparel, happy to be able to say and as we work on flow in all the categories better. But we have narrowed the gap, it's still a case though where apparel is chasing footwear and we do think that -- we still continue to think that the point where we're really at our A game with apparel, that it's got margin potential above footwear margins that we still have that rates going on and happily apparel has picked up speed in the race.","Kate McShane","Have you stated ideally where apparel margins should be, once you're at that point?","Dick Johnson","We think that apparel margin should be better than footwear margins in the end. If we\u2019re doing the right thing from buying and allocating point of view and running the lifecycle of the product appropriately with our markdown cadence. We see apparel margins being able to be equal to or better than footwear.","Lauren Peters","Yeah, it should be meaningfully better.","Kate McShane","And my last question is for Dick. guess it's almost nine months that you've been head of the company now and six months since the analyst day, just wondered if you had any kind of insight about what has surprised you during this time period, where do you think may be have a little bit more work to do then may be what you initially thought, any kind of insight into the first eight months on the job?","Dick Johnson","Look Kate, the continuity of the role has been probably one of the smoother things, Ken handled his exit in the beginning of the transition as the professional -- Ken's been professional that he is and Ken and I have worked hand in hand for a long time, so the new plan was a continuation plan the team continues to execute at a high level. So from the business point of view, we continue to make great progress and I don't see necessarily any surprises there Kate, the bigger surprise that I've had so far is the CEO roll doesn't come with 26 hours in a day and there is a lot of things that -- when Ken and I were working together, Ken handled some, I handled some and now I'm trying to be a good leader across the business and could use a couple of more hours in the day, but I'll have to figure it out.","Lauren Peters","Teammates trying to help him, pick up some of those hours.","Dick Johnson","Teammates trying help, absolutely.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Wanted to just ask about the price points, in a few different manners, one as we look forward to the fall and turn it around the corner into early '16 launches, any reason to see the pace of ASP gains slow or alter from recent results? Second, is are you able to speak to your current merchandizing mix as well as recent performance across various price points, perhaps below a 100 -- between a 100 and 150 and the more premium product above 150, be interested if there have been any standout performances between price points. And then third and lastly, there has been recently a big double-digit percentage increase in the price point of Kevin Durant basketball sneaker and it looks like there's going to be a double-digit percentage increase in the price of the retro Jordan sneaker to come, how do you we think about the elasticity of some of these products with that type of pricing change, what is embedded in the assumption for how units perform following such a deep increase?","Dick Johnson","You got a bunch of questions, so let me try to go back to the first one, we don't see price point growth slowing down in the back half certainly, I mean I think the customer, as long as there's great value in the product, they've proven that they're willing to pay the price and that's across various buckets that you talked about. If you're talking under $100, the consumer there has to see the right value associated with the price from a 100 to 150, really sort of the wheel house of getting towards that beginning of the premium, premium end. There has to be value for the price and when you get up to the higher price points the people that create those shoes do a great job of limiting distribution and the number of pairs in the marketplace. So there is a scarcity model that exist, that the consumer that gets those shoes feels really fortunate that they got them and they clear to this point have shown that they are willing to pay the price.","And our team does a nice job, follow up with each launch, with each product that they look at, they look at the cadence of other products before, the products that are coming after from a launch perspective. And they seem to be like more times than that with the qualities that we put into the marketplace. So, the real opportunity lies in maximizing the value for the customer across all of those price points. And our vendors were doing that.","Lauren Peters","And that\u2019s what we really focus on and our merchants are making sure that they\u2019re compelling product across the price point. So that we\u2019re don\u2019t leaving anybody behind.","Paul Trussell","So congrats again on the great quarter and please save me a pair of Yeezys tomorrow.","Dick Johnson","You know we can\u2019t do that Paul, but I have a feeling that you're already in line somewhere for them.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Bernard Sosnick with Gilford Securities. Please go ahead.","Bernard Sosnick","I like to say that when you move to new headquarters during conference calls I think I am going to miss the line of emergency vehicles, unless you pipe that in [Multiple Speakers] I know it's very early since the release of Compton and Dr. Dre\u2019s album. But I am wondering if you're seeing any inkling of a change in demand with regard to styling toward hip-hop and so when styling changes like that will it have any influence on what you're prepared for the holiday season and how quickly might you be able to adjust?","Dick Johnson","The footwear choices of all of the artists and athletes certainly have a bearing on what our customer chooses to wear. And with social media as active it is today they know what -- whoever is performing tonight, whatever he\u2019s wearing. So the fact the Yeezys shoe got some press today in the Wall Street Journal tells you that things are shifting. But our consumer is really driven by the moving and our vendors do a great job of helping manage those moments by bringing great products to bear in the marketplace. Sometimes with fewer pairs than we like to see, sometimes with more pairs than we like to see, but they manage that pretty well. So I think as the athletes and the artists continue to change their footwear choices, our customer react to that and certainly our buying team reacts to that as well.","Bernard Sosnick","Well, thank you and keep surprising us on the upside.","John Maurer","I think that\u2019s all we have time for. We appreciate your participation on our call today. We look forward to having you join us on our next call, which we expect will take place at 9:00 AM on Friday, November 20th, following the release of our third quarter and year-to-date earnings results earlier that morning.

Any changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results, and actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","If you have not received yesterday's release, it is available on the Internet at www.prnewswire.com or www.footlocker-inc.com. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John A. Maurer","Thank you, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to Foot Locker, Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Here with me this morning are Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ken Hicks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Lauren will first provide you with the details of our fourth quarter and full year results that we announced earlier this morning and then later, she will review some of our key financial assumptions going into 2013. In between, Ken and Dick will review some of our key accomplishments in the first year working towards our updated long-range plan and describe some of the exciting new store formats and other investments that are part of the increased capital expenditure program that we announced in February.","Let me start by setting the framework for today's discussion. Earlier this morning, we reported that Foot Locker produced earnings of $104 million in the fourth quarter or $0.68 per share, a 28% increase over the $0.53 per share that we earned in Q4 last year. As noted in the release, these GAAP results in 2012 included negative impact of $0.05 per share for an impairment charge related to our CCS business. On a non-GAAP basis, without that charge, our earnings per share were $0.73 in the fourth quarter.","The figures I just mentioned are based on a 14-week quarter in 2012 compared to the usual 13-week period, and the annual figures we reported are based on a 53-week year. The 53rd week added $14 million after-tax or $0.09 per share to our quarterly and annual results in 2012. The non-GAAP EPS figure of $0.64 that we included in our press release this morning excludes the 53rd week and the CCS impairment charges. This amount compares most closely to the non-GAAP results of $0.55 that we reported in Q4 last year, and both figures are based on 13 weeks and exclude onetime impairment charges.","Unless otherwise specified, ratios and margins that we discuss during this call will be based on the results excluding the 53rd week since this approach provides the best basis for comparison to both last year and the upcoming year. References to comp sales are for the 13- or 52-week period ended January 26, whereas references to total sales refers to the entire 14- or 53-week period ended February 2, 2013.","Before I turn the call over to Lauren, I'll call out our strong full year EPS results. On a GAAP basis, we earned a record $2.58 per share in 2012. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the 53rd week, the CCS impairment and the onetime tax benefits we called out in previous quarters, we earned $2.47 per share. This was an increase of 36% over last year's record-breaking performance of $1.82 per share, calculated on a comparable non-GAAP basis. As we head it into and through 2013, it is against this non-GAAP EPS figure of $2.47 and the quarters which made it up that we will most frequently make comparisons.","Now here's Lauren to give you more of the details.","Lauren B. Peters","Thank you, John, and welcome to you all. I'm pleased you could join us this morning as we discuss Foot Locker's 2012 results and our outlook for 2013.","The fourth quarter of 2012 marked yet another very strong performance for Foot Locker. Starting with sales, we produced a strong comparable store sales gain of 7.9% in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year comp sales gain to 9.4% and our 2-year stacked comp gain to just under 20%. In total, sales have increased more than 20% over the last 2 years to $6.2 billion. We have now surpassed almost all of the long-term financial goals we laid out at the beginning of 2010. And we're making good progress towards the elevated goals we set for ourselves a year ago. The one original goal we're still working towards is inventory turns. We've improved turns substantially. We are not yet 2x or 3x turn.","Turning to the Q4 details. We had solid gains in all families of business, with both footwear and apparel up high-single digits. Men's footwear, the basketball business was exceptionally strong with a comp gain of more than 20%. We led off the quarter with a very strong Black Friday week, and I do mean week, since we delivered exciting new premium product in the days leading up to Thanksgiving, as well as the days afterward. It turns out that a lot of our customers wanted to wear their new kicks in events with family and friends on Thanksgiving Day itself.","The rest of the holiday season was also strong in basketball. Big gains in Jordan, marquee player shoes and classics. Meanwhile, our running business in the U.S. remains solid with a low-single-digit gain for the quarter. Lightweight running performed well, particularly the Free, Flex and Dual Fusion from Nike. Technical running, fueled by ASICS, Mizuno, Brooks and Nike, also posted solid gains. With basketball being the primary driver in the quarter, it is no surprise with our U.S. businesses that again led the way in top line performance. Our direct-to-customer segment was up 18.2%. Eastbay's comp sales up in the low teens and our store banner.com site up more than 40%.","Among the store divisions, Kids Foot Locker was once again the top performer with a gain of almost 20%. Champs Sports also had another double-digit comp gain in the quarter. The Foot Locker division in the U.S. produced a comp gain in the high-single digits, while Footaction was up mid-single digits.","Foot Locker Europe posted a flat comp during the quarter, with basketball styles up significantly. Some of our customers in Europe continue to shift from running to basketball silhouettes.","The division with the most challenging sales result was Lady Foot Locker, which had a high-single-digit comp loss. As we transition our merchandise assortments to target the athletically active performance-oriented woman in her 20s and 30s, we have produced gains in apparel and in lightweight, technical and performance footwear. However, these gains are not yet offsetting the loss in certain classic and lifestyle shoes and opening price point apparel. Ken will speak more to our efforts in this area in a few minutes.","Rounding out our sales results by division, our other international teams performed well, with both Foot Locker Canada and Foot Locker Asia Pacific producing mid-single-digit comp increases for the quarter. Our comp cadence was as follows: November was up low-double digits; December was up high-single digits; and January was up mid-single digits. Like many other retailers, the end of January, including the 53rd week, was soft for us compared to the rest of the quarter. We believe that we were impacted by the same factors that others have called out before us, such is the initial pain felt by many of our customers from the payroll tax increase, delayed tax refund checks, shifts in the timing of product launches and maybe even some less favorable weather compared to last year.","Going against very strong 1-year and 2-year stacked comp, we started February 2013 with comp sales that were up low-single digits and the strongest gain, approximately 20%, coming from our direct-to-customer segment. Our store divisions, excluding Lady Foot Locker, were collectively up low-single digits. Of note, within that performance, Foot Locker Europe was also up low-single digits. Lady Foot Locker sales were down double digits.","Turning to margins. We picked up 90 basis points on a 14-week basis to bring our Q4 gross margin rate to 32.9% from 32% last year. The 53rd week contributed 50 basis points to that gain. So on a comparable 13-week basis, gross margin improved 40 basis points to 32.4%, with leverage of our fixed occupancy and buyer's expense adding 50 basis points, partially offset by a 10 basis point decline due to lower net shipping revenue.","Our merchandise margins were flat in the quarter, with a lower initial market percent offset by a lower markdown rate.","Apparel margins improved over last year, while footwear margins were essentially flat. However, we still have further progress to make before we can declare that we have consistently lifted our apparel margins higher than footwear.","Our SG&A rate decreased in the quarter from 21.6% to 21.4% on a comparable 13-week basis, with the extra week providing an additional 20 basis points of leverage for our reported SG&A rate of 21.2%. Expense dollars increased 7.7% on a 13-week basis, with the biggest increases coming in store wages and marketing.","Depreciation and amortization expense ticked up to $30 million from $28 million, reflecting the increased levels of capital spending over the last couple of years.","We have made a strategic decision to focus our future efforts in the skate category on our core online business. We believe we have the scale and expertise to be successful. As John mentioned, we did incur a CCS-related impairment charge of $12 million pretax in the fourth quarter or $0.05 per share after-tax. Approximately $7 million of this charge came from reducing the carrying value of the CCS trade name. The remainder of the impairment charge was due to writing off the value of CCS store-related PP&E.","We will operate the banner as a digital-only business and so we intend to close the 22 CCS stores in the current quarter due to their ongoing underperformance. This decision will result in an additional charge in the first quarter of 2013 for such costs as exiting leases and severance. Our current estimate is that this charge will be about $0.01 per share in Q1.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at 34%, somewhat below our usual run rate of 37%. The difference is primarily due to onetime adjustments in various jurisdictions, such as an amendment to certain tax rules in Europe that allowed us to claim approximately $2 million in refunds from prior years. It all added up to a record fourth quarter net income of $104 million or $0.68 per share on a GAAP basis. The $0.64 per share we earned in the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, in other words excluding the CCS impairment and the 53rd week, is a $0.09 or 16% improvement on last year's equivalent non-GAAP EPS figure of $0.55.","For the year, we earned a record $397 million or $2.58 per share on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $380 million, an impressive 35% increase over last year's non-GAAP equivalent of $281 million, which had been the most profitable year in our history as an athletic company.","The power of our earnings translated into an even stronger balance sheet. With operating cash flow of $416 million in 2012, we ended the year with $928 million of cash and short-term investments, an increase of $77 million from a year ago. This financial strength enabled us to announce last month 3 elevated capital deployment strategies beginning in 2013. First, our board increased our quarterly dividend by 11%, from $0.18 per share to $0.20 per share, equivalent to an annualized rate of $0.80 per share. This is the third straight year with a similar dividend increase.","Second, the Board of Directors approved a new 3-year $600 million share repurchase program extending through January 2016. This new program replaced the company's previous $400 million program under which the company spent $129 million in 2012.","Finally, the company announced a significant increase to our capital expenditure program for 2013 from $163 million in 2012 to $220 million this year. Dick will detail these investments in just a moment.","Another investment we made at the end of last year was in positioning our inventory for the important February selling season. At year end, inventory was up 9%, about the same as sales. However, much of this increase came during the 53rd week when we brought in fresh merchandise to support February sales. Comparing our inventory level at the -- at year end to where we were at the end of week 1 of 2012, which is the equivalent week in terms of sales flow, our inventory was essentially flat year-over-year. In other words, the increase in inventory at year end was entirely planned to support sales and does not represent a change in our objective of growing inventory at roughly half the pace of our sales increases.","We ended the year with 3,335 stores, a decrease of 34 from the beginning of the year. 44, or roughly half of the 85 new stores we opened were in Europe, while roughly half of the 119 stores we closed were domestic Foot Lockers. Many of these closed stores were being used as clearance outlets. And with fresher, more productive inventory, we can operate with fewer clearance stores. We also closed 29 Lady Foot Locker stores.","With that recap with 2012, let me now turn the call over to Ken and Dick to describe how we achieved these results and review some of the exciting investment opportunities we see in our business. Before we get to your questions, I'll jump back in to discuss our annual and quarterly expectations for 2013, which get a little tricky with the 53rd week in 2012. Ken?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thank you, Lauren. I want to start by acknowledging the tremendous success of the entire team at Foot Locker in 2012. In 2011, we set several financial and operational records for our company, including earning an unprecedented $1.82 per share. With the momentum we built from executing our strategic initiatives in 2012, we were able to surpass that record by 36%, achieving non-GAAP earnings of $2.47 per share.","At $6.2 billion, we also reached the highest sales in our history as an athletic company. We hit a record for sales per square foot at $443. Our gross margin rate hit a new high. Our EBIT dollars and margin rate at 9.9% were the best ever. Conversion rates and sales per payroll hour were also the best ever. Our EPS was the highest ever, and our return on invested capital hit 14.2%, making it the first of our current long-term goals that we have achieved.","It is an impressive list of accomplishments and I want to thank the team at Foot Locker for their focus and dedication to executing our 6 primary strategies, which led to these excellent results. First, we kept a clear customer focus. We developed product offerings that reflected the point of view of the core customer for each of our banners, and we created store and online environments that enhanced these offerings. We told powerful marketing stories, such as the Foot Locker Approved campaign and the We Know Game campaign at Champs Sports, which definitely resonated with each of their target customers.","The overall result was that we strengthened our leading position in basketball, the hottest category in our industry, while also maintaining strong running and casual businesses.","Second, we made our stores and digital sites exciting places to shop and buy by delivering compelling product stories and strengthening the messaging by being consistent between the stores and online. We also created strong events, such as the Hottest Month Ever and the Week of Greatness that provided a more consistent sales performance throughout the year.","We also developed or tested new store formats for Champs, Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker, and we created an exciting brand-new banner, SIX:02. We used new tools in our stores to increase productivity and customer engagement, and we invested in improving our associate selling skills. We provided excellent service in our digital channels including easy navigation, timely shipping, helpful call center responses and, again, good customer engagement features.","Third, we delivered growth in most of our high potential business segments. Apparel comps were up double digits in 2012, driven by compelling assortments that targeted each banner's core customer. We effectively leveraged team additions capabilities working with the brands to create, test and roll out a tremendous amount of graphic and attitude T-shirts that our customers enjoyed hooking up with their footwear.","The strength of our kids business was exceptional. And it wasn't just the high teens comp in Kids Foot Locker, we also delivered double-digit comp sales in almost every other format and region where we sell kids products, including a 40-plus percent gain in digital sales of kids product. We used a Go Big marketing campaign for our Kids Foot Locker business and it was a good description of what happened to our results.","We believe that we have an opportunity to grow our women's business significantly over the next few years, and 2012 was a year of clarifying and refocusing our women's business across all of our banners. The sales results for Lady Foot Locker were not positive for the year, but we focused on improving the productivity of the overall women's business by closing underperforming Lady Foot Locker stores and refining our assortments across all of our banners. As a result, we did manage a flat sales performance overall in women's led, once again, by strong sales in our digital channels.","Fourth, we expanded both our digital and store brands. Our banner.com sales increases were very strong all year, running up more than 40%. We increased the coordination across digital and store organizations, upgraded all of our mobile and online sites and enhanced our customer engagement features. We stated that our goal is for individual banner.com sales to reach 10% of each banner's total sales. Although we still have a distance to go to reach this goal, we made significant progress in each of our banners. Our direct-to-customer sales in total constituted 9.9% of our total sales. This includes our biggest online banner, Eastbay.com, which was up low-double digits for the year.","In Europe, we added a net 34 stores augmenting our presence in our current markets, especially in malls and expanding in under-penetrated countries. We also extended our European.com business to a total of 8 countries.","We expanded to 65 the number of Foot Lockers that include a House of Hoops with a target of adding 100 more over the next few years. The productivity of these stores increases significantly with the addition of House of Hoops, and we're exploring other vendor partnerships to test similar ideas such as the Adidas collective shops we recently opened in Footaction and the Nike R line in Champs Sports.","Even with all these accomplishments, we recognized that many opportunities still lie ahead of us to increase our productivity further and give our industry-leading retail team even better tools to deliver exciting experiences and product to our customers.","Let me introduce Dick Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer, to tell you about the investments we plan to make in 2013. Dick?","Richard A. Johnson","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, all. As Lauren mentioned, last month, we announced plans to invest aggressively in these opportunities, elevating our capital expenditure program to $220 million in 2013. This is an increase of, approximately, $60 million over 2012.","Let me describe some of the dynamics of this plan. First, the amount of capital allocated to new stores and relocations is fairly similar year-over-year. We intend to continue building our presence in Europe with 30 to 35 of the 73 new stores planned for 2013 targeted for Western Europe. The division with the next biggest new store allocation is Kids Foot Locker in all of our markets, with just under 20 new stores planned. By far, the biggest factor in the year-over-year increase in capital is due to doubling the spend on store remodels. Development of the new format in Champs Sports started back in 2011, and we experienced significant upside to the productivity in the 11 test stores that we opened in 2012. We plan to invest significantly more dollars in store remodels in 2013 and we will have touched more than 15% of the Champs fleet by the end of 2013.","Foot Locker also experienced very strong sales lifts in doors where we tested our new format, which we call Willowbrook after the mall in New Jersey where we put one of the first prototype stores. In 2013, we plan to remodel close to 10% of the Foot Locker fleet to the new model.","We will also be remodeling more Kids Foot Locker stores in 2013 based on the positive results in our 12 test stores. Between these divisions, we will be almost tripling the number of significant remodel projects we undertake in 2013 to well over 200. We believe this strikes a prudent balance between capturing the potential sales lift as quickly as possible and being sure of properly executing the projects. All of these projects generated investment returns significantly in excess of our hurdle rates, which are a 13% IRR over the life of the project and an 11% ROIC at the end of the third year.","Along the way, we have learned many lessons from testing the new formats in many different markets and different store configurations, so we expect to make the rollouts even more productive.","We are still in the prototype development and testing phase in our women's business. The SIX:02 and newly designed Lady Foot Locker stores are performing better than the rest of the chain, but this does not yet prove the case for a larger rollout. We will open 4 new test SIX:02 stores during the second half of 2013. As we adjust the formula before committing to a rollout, we are actually spending less capital this year on our women's business.","Another area with a significant increase in capital spending in 2013 is information technology. Within this category, the biggest single investment is for our new merchandise allocation system, which underwent a successful proof of concept last year. In 2013, we plan to invest in the thorough design and testing of this very robust and sophisticated software. Full rollout is not expected until 2014.","To maximize the potential of this investment, it is absolutely critical to develop the tool properly for our business. Once in place, we believe this system can be a key factor in further enhancing our inventory productivity by delivering the \"rights\": the right product, in the right store, at the right time, in the right size, and in the right quantity.","Also within technology, we have allocated capital to upgrading our warehouse management systems in Europe and the U.S., rolling out our time and attendance system to the rest of the globe and implementing various other projects to improve the in-store experience or reduce costs in our administrative processes.","Finally, we continue to invest significant incremental capital in our digital businesses, both mobile and online, in order to drive the exceptional performance we have come to expect from our team at Footlocker.com.","Let me now turn the call back over to Lauren so that she can put all of these initiatives in the financial context of what we expect for 2013.","Lauren B. Peters","Thanks, Dick. We have another exciting year ahead of us and let me offer some insight into how we currently see it shaping up. First, we expect to deliver another double-digit percentage annual profit increase for 2013, driven by a mid-single-digit comp sales gain. That profit increase is based off of the 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share figure of $2.47 that we discussed earlier.","We are planning comparable store sales to be fairly steady, around mid-single digits, throughout the year. We used the standard National Retail Federation 4-5-4 Calendar and the 53rd week of 2012 shifts the weeks to keep them comparable year-over-year for comp store sales statistic.","For your own modeling purposes, please note that reported annual and quarterly sales and profits are not shifted. As a result, there will be a significant variation in total sales and profit results by quarter. For example, starting with the first quarter, we give up the high volume first week of February and gain the lower volume first week of May. Historically, the first week of February generates about $20 million more in sales than the first week in May. By contrast, the second quarter loses the lower volume week in May I just mentioned and picks up a higher volume back-to-school week in August. As a result, we believe this will add about $40 million to sales in Q2.","The opposite happens in the third quarter as we trade that back-to-school week in August for a relatively light week at the end of October. We expect this to negatively impact sales by $40 million.","Finally, the shift caused by the 53rd week in 2012 is not expected to have a significant impact on the fourth quarter as the last week of October and the last week of January are planned similarly.","Turning to margins. We are planning for flat to slightly positive gross margin results in 2013. We expect the downward pressure on our initial mark-up rate should be less intense this year than it was in 2012, but it remains a factor in merchandise margins. We plan to offset the impact of a lower IMU by decreasing our markdown rate through the application of our business intelligence tool and continuing our merchandise flow initiative, both internally and with our vendors among other strategies.","Our planned mid-single-digit comp increase should also provide the opportunity to leverage our fixed costs for the full year, both within gross margin and SG&A. With the sales shifts that I just described, however, the first and third quarters will have relatively less leverage benefit and the second quarter will have relatively more. Specifically, in terms of SG&A, we intend to sustain our investment and marketing campaigns to help drive traffic into our stores. As a proportion of sales, marketing expense in 2013 is expected to be similar to 2012.","The other major expense lines are also expected to be similar in 2013 as a proportion of sales compared to 2012. Some of you have asked about the impact on SG&A of the additional capital projects we are undertaking. We will add some staff and some expense in certain areas, such as our real estate construction department. But because they are dedicated to specific capital projects, their salaries are mostly capitalized as part of the CapEx total of $220 million.","To round out the rest of the income statement, depreciation and amortization is planned to trend up to approximately $122 million in 2013 as a result of the investments we are making. Interest expense is expected to be about flat with 2012 at $5 million. We are planning our tax rate at 37%, and we are assuming FX rates to be slightly less favorable than last year with the euro around $1.25.","In addition to the 73 new stores that Dick mentioned we expect to open in 2013, we plan to close approximately 88 as we continue to address low performance stores and improve our key productivity measures.","With that review of 2013, let me turn the call back over to Ken to wrap up before we get to your questions. Ken?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Lauren. As we said, we set many records in 2012 with our financial and operational performance. Last year started off with an absolutely terrific February, and despite the economic and fiscal challenges we're facing this year, I'm pleased to say that we successfully beat that performance this February with a low-single-digit comp gain.","The comp comparisons do get a little bit easier going forward. And although it is early, our March sales are off to a solid start, up high-single digits. We were planning an even stronger start to the year, and we're monitoring some of the economic factors that we believe impacted business at the end of January and the beginning of February. We'll make adjustments as necessary, but our inventory is fresh and the product pipeline in basketball, running, classics and apparel is strong with exciting young players like Kevin Durant coming to the floor and innovative products like the Nike Flyknit and Adidas Boost ready to hit the market in a much bigger way.","It is a long year and we have a lot of hard work to do to deliver on the numbers that Lauren just described. However, our plans are in place, our initiatives are underway and we have established our long-term goals in order to measure our progress. We have our core values to guide us along the way. We're done shaking each other's hands in celebration of last year, and the entire team at Foot Locker is now focused and optimistic about our ability to deliver another record year in 2013.","Thank you. Let's turn the call over to questions now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick clarification, Ken. So I think we got a March and a February number in there. Can you just tell us where the quarter-to-date is on comps right now?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We didn't -- we did not say that. But the quarter up is, right now, is in the low singles. We recognize we only have a couple of days of March and then the whole month of February.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Got it. Okay. So with basketball up 20% plus in the quarter, I'm trying to figure out what were some of the headwinds that brought the core Foot Locker chain down to comps of about high-single digits. Could you comment on some of the offsets there?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, running, as we said, is not up to that level. And some of the classics did not perform at a stronger level.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And so you're rebooting a little bit on the women's side. You've got some new test stores of SIX:02. But I think it's safe to say even with that, that the negative high-single-digit decline at Lady Foot Locker wasn't up to where you thought it'd be at this point after all the stores you've closed over the years in the Lady business. Can you give us kind of an update on what's going on there? And it seems that -- what is causing, perhaps, a deceleration even at this point, maybe a little bit on how you think the -- how you think about what gives you confidence in the opportunity to grow that significantly over the next few years?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we obviously would like for the women's business to be stronger. The challenges that we have in women is, the Lady Foot Locker business, is that we've changed that customer. And you guys have heard me say before, when you fire a customer, they know immediately, and it takes a while to bring a customer in. Our overall women's business, as we said, was flat. So we're able to make up that loss with the fashion customer in our other chains like Foot Locker and Champs. We -- in Lady, as we move to a more active customer, a little bit older, 25 to 35, that's taking time. We also are going through a transition in the apparel area where we've sold a lot of cotton by the pound and now we're focusing on higher quality from both the brands and our own private Actra label.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Within your guidance, I wondered if you could give us any indication of what your ASP outlook is for the year.","Lauren B. Peters","ASPs have been favorable and we expect that, that would continue to help support the -- that mid-single-digit comp gain guidance that we gave. And the value that we're putting into products and what we're offering to customers supporting that and the other thing that is contributing to that is our shifts in apparel as we've move that business to a branded product away from that cotton by the pound that Ken mentioned.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And I know it's early days, but wondered if you had seen any change in the running category momentum since the new Flynit product has come out.","Richard A. Johnson","Well, we've got Flynit featured in our RUN stores. We expect a bigger batch of Flyknit to be in our stores in April and May. So we expect to see some very positive movement with that.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question is just on Europe. Ken, can you walk us through a little bit what you're seeing in Europe? How -- I know the comps were up low-single digits, maybe how the environment has changed this past quarter versus the quarter before?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we're seeing similar things to what we have seen in Europe from the point that the Northern Europe, and particularly Germany, continues to be strong. Southern Europe has its challenges. But what we think is that it's reached a level that's maintainable level. We also have worked hard on our assortments there. We've put in a stronger basketball and performance in running position and those have worked well for us. So we're seeing the product mix help us. We are strengthening our position in the markets that are not as impacted by some of the things going on. And even in those markets, we see kind of a settling out of the business.","Operator","The next question comes from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of quick follow-up questions. One of them was just given the slow start to February that you've seen and it sounds like March has gotten a little better, but has the competitive environment changed at all? Is there any competitors that might have too much inventory? Have you seen any promotional activity kicking up this spring? And then I have a few follow-ups as well.","Kenneth C. Hicks","No. We haven't -- we have not seen -- I think everybody has done a pretty good job managing their inventory. And at this point, we knew it wouldn't be great with some of the shifts and some of the things that happened. And as we look to the pickup, hopefully, that will help clear through some of the inventory. But at this point, we haven't seen anybody taking any special action.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then on the Lady Foot Locker commentary, can you just help us understand your view of the timeline of firing the customer and then rehiring -- or hiring, I guess, the new one? When do you think the transition could even out and you could start to see Lady at least get to flattish comps?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, my expression would be it can start any time, but I know it takes a while. And I think we are starting to see and starting to hear anecdotally some very good things. And we're looking at different markets and different stores and seeing some nice pickups. Our technical running business actually is very, very good. The branded apparel business is very good, but it's trying to offset a lot of 4 for $20 T-shirts that we used to sell. And so these -- as these elements start to -- or continue to pick up and we anniversary some of the promotional elements and fashion elements we have, we think we will start to see the -- or we should see the business start to improve. And I think that will be -- as we move into the summer season and into the fall, we'll start to have -- that customer will find us and we will benefit. But it takes a while to bring in a new customer, particularly when she's not used to shopping with you. The thing that's been fortunate is that the fashion customer was -- has moved pretty quickly to the Foot Locker and Champs. And I think the thing there that we're seeing is she was probably shopping in both places anyway so it didn't take her a long time to learn. But we've -- we're working and I think as we anniversary in the summer and moving into the fall, we'll start to see some benefit.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And last quick question. You called out Nike a few times. Can you remind us what your strategy is with Under Armour, how many doors you have Under Armour apparel? And also what you see on the Under Armour footwear side right now and how you're thinking about it for fall this year?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, Under Armour is an important part of our strategy, both in apparel and shoes. And I think that we will continue to build and work with them. We're one of their focal points with the shoe business, running and basketball. I'll let Dick talk about the number of doors, but it is pretty widely distributed throughout the chain.","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, from an apparel point of view, we've got good representation in both Champs and Foot Locker in North America in the U.S. And on the footwear side, a few -- a little slightly fewer doors than the apparel. But when you add in the cleated product that they sell out at Eastbay, we have a strong representation with Under Armour footwear across the chains.","Operator","Our next question comes from Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ken, I want to ask you a question that I just can't get enough of from investors, and that's around the perceived product cyclicality, perceived being the magic word here, but the product cyclicality of this business. So before you got to Foot Locker, this is a business that's averaged mid-single-digit operating margins, modest comp growth, which begs the question as we anniversary some of these impressive numbers, it's all about what have you done for me lately, right? So I guess the question is, what's different in the business today versus the 2000s? Do you think this is a cyclical business product-wise or not? And if not, if you could just kind of plead the case.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, I think 2 parts to the question. The first part is on cyclicality and there are cycles to any business. But I think one of the things we're benefiting from is a trend versus a cycle. There is a trend to people wearing more athletic shoes and apparel. I don't know what you're wearing today, but if you had your choice, you'd be like me wearing sneakers. And more and more people do that and that helps the business. We are in a strong cycle because of the newness and what's being introduced. And from what we've seen in the pipeline and what, for example, Kate talked about, new product, Flynit, Boost, color is unbelievable and that's selling. That is building the cycle and supporting the strong upward trend that we have. With regard to margins, we have done our margins almost entirely on our back. We haven't gone to vendors and asked for money or anything, and we continue to work with them to make sure that we have the right product at the right time in the right place and the right quantities. And our teams are working hard with the vendors on flow that has allowed us to be smarter about the inventory so we don't have to mark as many things down. We also are working hard with different systems, business intelligence systems and planning systems, to do a better job. And we think our allocation system will help us there, which will reduce markdowns and increase the amount of full price selling. The other thing that I think that we're seeing is this is a market where, because of the trend that's occurred, we've been more rational and people aren't having to cut. Our vendors work very, very hard to make sure that their product is competitive. But at the same time that they have -- we're not competing against the whole world. We have a certain product. We have high quality, high performance product and that's what the customer wants and it's allowed us to capture the pricing that we've been able to capture. And the other thing with regard to margins is the importance of productivity. It's one of the reasons why we continue to push on things that will improve the current stores rather than open a lot more stores because as you open and expand stores, the productivity declines, the profitability declines. We're able, at $440 plus a foot, to be much more productive and deliver a better experience to our customers, better -- and better profits to us and better sales to the industry.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I could just ask a second question. I know you announced the dividend increase and the increased share buyback authorization a couple of weeks ago. What's the board's general philosophy towards share buyback? I think the pattern has been about $350 million of free cash flow. It seems like about 1\/3 of that has been spent on dividends, another 1\/3 on buybacks. You're obviously increasing your CapEx budget this year, but you're sitting on about $1 billion of cash. No debt, if you exclude operating leases, about 20% of your market cap. I mean, is there any desire to maybe get more aggressive there?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I'm going to talk to your banker. If you can exclude the rent that you pay as not being debt, that's -- I like that banker. We do have -- we have opportunities and we are, we feel, making good strides and increasing the dividend. We've done it 3 years in a row at that 10% about level. We have an active buyback program and the board's view is we evaluate that on an ongoing basis, but we feel it's important that we use that as one of the tools to have to return value to the shareholders. We also are putting in a number of programs. And as Dick said, we're seeing how they perform and the rollout so that it doesn't hurt the overall business. If we can do it faster and more of them next year, we can step that up and get even more of the chain at the high performance level. So having that ability is very important and the flexibility to be able to improve our overall performance and productivity to improve our profitability.","Operator","Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Ken, I was hoping you could talk maybe a little bit about the -- in more detail around what you're seeing from the comp of the store remodels by banner, give us maybe a little bit more detail around that and how we should think about how those stores are comping versus those untouched stores?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we have stated in the past that the remodels have performed very well. But one of the reasons why you do tests and have them in various parts of the country is when you do -- first do your prototype, it gets a lot of attention and we want to make sure that it's real. So we spread them out. We have continued to see sales and profitability above the company average. They exceed the hurdles that Dick talked about in his presentation and make it very attractive for us to be as aggressive as we are. When you talk about 15% of the Champs chain and 10% of the Foot Locker chain in a year with the number of stores we have, that's moving out reasonably aggressive. And I think we've demonstrated that we will wait until we see something good. We'll test it and see if it's good, we will move on it. So we're not giving the specifics because I think as it expands, it probably won't be quite as good as the test stores. But even if it's not quite as good, we will more than clear our hurdles.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Would you care to talk about the directionality of those improvements over the untouched stores? Meaning, are they 70% above the chain average or 30% above the average? Any kind of approximation would be incredibly helpful.","Kenneth C. Hicks","No.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","All right, had to try. Okay. And then with regards to the apparel margins, I think, Lauren, you said that apparel margins were continuing to trend upward where footwear margins look like they have -- they were flat in the quarter, if I'm not mistaken. What inhibits apparel margins from helping drive continued merchandise margin or merchandise margin expansion above what you guys are planning in 2013?","Lauren B. Peters","You absolutely got that right. Right. There's nothing that should prevent it. If we can continue to deliver improved apparel margins and it should be significantly higher in branded apparel than branded footwear, we think it's got upside to our margins in the long term. But you got to get the offering right, you got to get the apparel matched to the footwear and you have to really create an apparel offering that the customer knows you for.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Camilo, there's a couple of things that are occurring that we're working on. One is you have the issue with the level of private label. Our private label, because we shifted from promotional to more performance, in the case of women's, and more fashion, in the case of, say, for example, Champs sports gear, we've had a drop and we haven't built that back up yet. We are now starting to build back our private label and that will provide upward margins. The second thing, I think, is as we improve our planning and allocation because one of the challenges that we have in apparel is the level of markdowns and that ranges from having the wrong colors or sizes or whatever. And so as we continue to improve that, and that's one of the things that we feel the new system will help us with in getting the allocation. And it's not just the wrong size, it's making sure some market's bright colors sell better than dark colors or a team or a player and those...","Lauren B. Peters","Getting -- hitting the seasons.","Kenneth C. Hicks","The season of taking markdowns at the right time. Those things will help us a lot and we are still getting better at it. And it's -- the great thing about retail is it's a business where you get to practice and you have to practice, and we are still improving our abilities in the apparel, getting up to the level we have in shoes.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Great. And just one final question on that topic. What type of margin improvement from apparel is embedded in the guidance?","Lauren B. Peters","I can't split it out for you that way. But what we do believe that we've got, as we said, opportunity in markets through leveraging the fixed costs. And we're looking at the merchandise margins where we're planning flat to slightly positive with that IMU pressure that we talked about being offset by lower markdowns.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So it sounds like there's some embedded expectation of improvement in apparel. But given the way you just said prior to that, there's definitely room for upside from that perspective in that category.","Lauren B. Peters","That's right. It doesn't happen overnight and we think it's got long-term opportunity for us.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Great. That's great. And then just lastly on the components of the comp in the quarter. I think it would be helpful if you were able to parse out ticket, traffic, conversion, particularly as you got towards the end of the quarter, maybe how that could've been impacted by some of the macro pressures that you discussed earlier.","Lauren B. Peters","Well, I can't break all of those out for you by month. But I could tell you, as we said, ASPs were up. Traffic up, that would have had some variance as you got into late January. And conversion up, and that conversion was up consistently throughout the quarter.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. So it really was the traffic that seemed to have caused a lot of the variation, like it has for a lot of other retailers.","Lauren B. Peters","Well, it certainly was a factor.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just for Europe, what's your thought process in terms of the comp progression for 2013? You referenced mid-single-digit for the total company and the margin progression for Europe given that you had some margin pressure there. You dealt with some apparel issues there. Just sort of how we think about Europe as 2013 plays out.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We know it's a challenging environment. We're pleased with where they are now. But I will tell you that our plan is low-single digits right now.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Would you expect the margin profile to be better in Europe year-over-year?","Kenneth C. Hicks","The year-over-year...","Lauren B. Peters","Margins in Europe continue to be stronger than domestic. So if that hasn't changed year-over-year, yes, slight pickup.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then Lauren, for you, just on the comment about double-digit earnings growth for the year. Any -- as you parcel that out by quarter, just given the nuances in terms of the timing of sales and the week shifts, are there certain quarters where you couldn't obtain double-digit earnings growth? Or is it pretty consistent?","Lauren B. Peters","Follow that logic that we laid out for the sales challenge that we got with the shift. So first quarter, third quarter, double digit would be aggressive. Second quarter, fourth quarter, that's where you're going to see that benefit.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question I have was just on the new stores, the remodels. Are you guys anticipating any benefit in '13 either from a -- I don't know if those new stores are now in your comp base or you take them out of the comp and they're titled as new stores, but are you anticipating any benefit in '13 from them whether comp or margin? Is that in your thought process at all?","Kenneth C. Hicks","You're saying the remodels?","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right. In other words, the remodels, the Willowbrook -- the stores that are in the Willowbrook Mall, the Foot Locker and specifically the Champs, the 10%, 15% you plan on doing. Is any of that in the '13 number in terms of what you're seeing?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, we built our plan around the expectation of these remodels performing -- Ken mentioned that they outperformed the fleet. So yes, it's been included in our plan.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Are they in a -- Dick, are they in the comp or are they...","Richard A. Johnson","They're comp stores, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can we talk a little bit about the SIX:02 concept, and what the -- you opened up a few new ones. It sounds like they're going to -- might vary from the original. Can you talk about what you've seen as good, what you see that may be challenging there and sort of where that is on the continuum of sorting out what really is going to work for Lady?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we've gotten very good feedback on the stores. And the -- some of the -- one of the stores is doing phenomenal, one is doing what we thought and one is not doing quite so well. So that's why be run tests, to get a more consistent read. And but in all of them, the customer reaction has been strong. The things that we're looking at and trying to understand is how we can make sure that we better show the brands that we have, get more credit for the strong shoe position we have, make sure that we're able to provide an environment that the customer feels excited about and comes back to. So we're talking about making -- doing some things to make it friendlier. So we're not looking at changing, wholesale changes to the format. It's gotten some good reaction and we know that it can work. Now we're in a position where we want to make some adjustments and then test and see how those work and make a determination how fast we could expand it.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then can you give us an idea -- I mean, you might have said it, but by week in -- starting sort of like by week of how the comps were in like week -- in the last week of January, how they rolled through to today, just to see how the effect of the tax refunds are maybe evolving here?","Kenneth C. Hicks","What we've said was that the end of January was tough. February was also...","John A. Maurer","Start of February was tough.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Start of February was tough, got better. And that March is up high-single digits. So that's kind of the transition.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Were you up -- I mean, could we assume that you were up in that high-single digits of the last week of February, as well, and the front half was pretty -- or the first week was pretty terrible?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We're not by week. It -- the -- given the...","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","This is just an exceptional. This is an exceptional time because of this -- this strictly is tax refunds, that's why I'm asking the question.","Kenneth C. Hicks","It got -- February got better as we went through the month and it ended up in the low high-single digits. But it did improve and we really -- March is all of 5 days old, so we've got -- we fortunately have seen some nice results. But that's what I say. It'll be probably later in the month before we get a real good feel for all of the things that are happening.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, there's been a lot of conversation out there about the running business. I mean, you saw low-single-digit increase in the running business. When you look at your -- when you're looking at the year going forward and thinking about that business, can you give us some color on that?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I think the running business is a good business and it will perform in the low- to mid-single digits which, based upon the size of that business, is pretty good. We don't see that being as explosive as basketball. But as some new ideas like Flynit, like Boost, like what people -- like Under Armour are doing, the continuation of the strength of lightweight from people like Nike, the technical people continue to do well in -- with Mizuno and Brooks and ASICS, all of which are very strong for us, we think it's a good solid business with good solid growth. We'd like to see it grow at the chain. Some people have got some concerns about that. I don't see the concerns about the running business that other people do. I think it's a good solid business. It's not -- we would all like to have businesses that are up in the double digits. But what makes the world work and go are those businesses that perform solidly on a consistent basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a few follow-ups on the remodels. Lauren, could you speak -- or Dick or Ken, could you speak to the timing of the remodels and the system investments this year just so we could have a better idea about SG&A spend throughout the year? Second, could you just speak to the expectation kind of going forward? Should we think about 200 remodels or so a year? Completing 15% of Champs again in 2014, for example. And then just lastly, is the amount of investment this year relatively fixed? And therefore, if there is upside to the top line, we'll be -- will we be able to see that flow through to the bottom?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. So the first question was about the timing of the construction progress -- projects. We skewed out, if you will, to the first half of the year. It would be much of the activity happens in Q2, a fair amount that happens in Q1, but Q2 would be the highest point of it. You want to get the work done before you're into back-to-school season, and certainly, you're not going to be in there on holiday, so that's why it's front half. The payment, right, follow that cadence, so you're paying as you go through, but you're making your last payments at the end of that. The allocation of technology investment, that would be something that is more ratable over the year. It's not that, that sticks out in 1 quarter. Your second question was around whether or not that we could continue with this in an elevated capital program. Well, yes, if these continue to deliver as we have seen in the testing and expect them to deliver as we roll out, absolutely, which gets back to our earlier conversation about maintaining our flexibility with our balance sheet to be able to do that and we see that we could. And then your third question, again, if you could repeat that.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wondering if your investments this year are relatively fixed in regards to the ability for additional upside from a top line standpoint to flow through the bottom line.","Lauren B. Peters","Is your question, could we do more projects this year than what we've laid out?","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Would you flex higher if you -- the remodels that you roll out 1Q, 2Q, would you potentially flex that higher? Are there other projects that are being considered to maybe add towards the end of the year? Just anything in regards to the -- I was just looking at your SG&A spend this year as kind of planned. In other words, what -- on a mid-single-digit comp, what is SG&A dollars expected to rise for the full year?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. Okay. So to answer the question about the projects, no, I wouldn't see us putting more in than we've already described at the $220 million because, as you can imagine, that takes a lot of planning on the part of the construction team and the leasing team to accomplish all of that. But yes, we expect, as we said, to get leverage out of the mid-single-digit comp on the SG&A. So yes, we planned the expenses and as we -- you see further upside to sales if we see that. Yes, you would expect to get greater leverage because we're not going to be plowing in more dollars into SG&A. So we've established our operating plan, inclusive of marketing plans, as we said, are flat as a rate of sales year-over-year. So yes, there's upside to mid-single digit. You'd get greater flow-through.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Zolidis from The Buckingham Group.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I know we're running long so I'll keep this quick. One, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about why kids' is so strong. And then secondly, are you guiding to operating margin expansion 13 x the items on the 53rd week? Just a little confused about how we get to double-digit earnings growth on the mid-single-digit comps, taking into account the other color you've given us on gross margin and SG&A.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, I can take the -- to how you model. Yes, off of a non-GAAP number of $2.47. That's how we're modeling that. So that's x the 53rd week and it's x the impairment.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So you are expecting operating margin expansion?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes.","Richard A. Johnson","Our kids' business across all of the banners that sell kids' just continues to be strong. A couple of the key items, there's great takedown product, all the exciting things that Ken talked about from color to technology to marquee player shoes takedown -- marquee player shoes and takedown formats are working well and importantly, in our Kids Foot Locker chain, we've expanded our apparel significantly. We've moved into a brand of representation of apparel there that's very strong. So I think the ability to hook up T-shirts, fleece pieces, shorts, with the sneakers to accessorize it appropriately, especially in the Kids Foot Locker stores then across the other banners is just a strength of kids' footwear right now from a matching big brother or dad's footwear is really very strong.","Richard A. Johnson","The other thing, and it goes to my comment about the trend, I don't know how many people on the call have kids. You aren't buying a lot of penny loafers and oxfords for your kids anymore. In fact, we will -- we -- Easter is a good time for us because instead of buying a kid of a pair of black dress shoes that they can wear to church, the parents say, what the heck, give into him, I'll buy him a nice pair of sneakers and they'll wear a nice pair of sneakers to church and then they can wear them beyond the 1 day. So there's -- it is definitely a trend. And all of those kids wearing sneakers all the time are growing up. And there'll be use to them and they will see no sense in wearing uncomfortable brown shoes as they get older.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse.","Seth Sigman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to clarify on the merchandise margin. Ken, given the drivers you talked about plus Europe now improving, which was a headwind last year, I mean, can you maybe quantify what's embedded for merchandise margins in that flat to slightly positive margin guidance for the year?","Lauren B. Peters","Modest basis point improvement. We, as we said, we've got IMU pressure, which we think we can offset. We don't see -- so now moving off of merchandise margin onto total gross margin, we don't see the decline in net shipping revenue going away. So that's still a headwind. But we do still believe on mid-single digit that we get leverage out of the fixed costs.","Seth Sigman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just shifting to some of the online investments that you talked about for 2013. I mean, can you maybe just elaborate on that? Are there any major changes planned that we should be watching for or kind of just view them as minor enhancements for the year ahead?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we continue to update the site and make it a more engaging place to shop. We are also working hard on things like buy online, reserve in-store, inventory lookup for the customer, buy online, pay in-store. All sorts of different mechanisms that connect the stores and the online, giving our associates tools in their hands where they can test and communicate with the customer. But the real thing is when you look at the content that's involved and working with the vendors and working with the stores, that there's tremendous content that gets the people to the site to learn about what Katie wore last night or see how I compared against the latest kids on the combine, to understand when the launch is. And some of the marketing efforts that we're doing, we're working on a consolidated database between all of our locations so we know, we understand that customer and can really can be smart when we communicate with them. And the whole big data thing that you've read so much about recently, that gives us a terrific position with the customer and communicating with them. And so there's no -- you're not going to look and see, geez, it's a whole different site. What you're going to see is an evolution of things that engage that customer and allow us to better communicate and serve them.","Operator","Your next question comes from Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Wanted to follow up on the IMU kind of expectations. I know there've been a little bit more of a pressure on that -- from that front in 2012, and it sounds like you're expecting that to ease a little bit. Can you just talk about some of the drivers behind the IMU pressure you saw in '12 and where, specifically, do you see some expectations of that easing a little bit in 2013? And then I have one follow-up question.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, the pressures were that the costs were rising for a number of reasons, and they were rising faster in some degree than the retails. The pressure on the costs have mitigated somewhat. They're still there, but they've mitigated. And we continue to work and anticipate those with the vendors and have, say, what can we price this shoe at and still make sure we can get the volume from it. So it's -- the pressure is the continued rise of the cost of the product and making sure that we don't put the product out of the price range of the customer.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, Ken, on a related topic, how do you think about -- pricing has been a little bit of a sales driver the last few years. Where -- what, kind of if you look across the chains kind of on average, what your price increases ranges have been last year versus what you're expecting this year and going forward?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We haven't put out the percentage. But a low-single digit percentage price increase is one that the customer has shown the ability to absorb and allows us the ability to absorb the cost increases. So the customer says when a shoe goes up significantly, the volume drops. That's economics 101. When it goes up modestly, the customer continues to buy it. You also have to understand whether it's a new shoe and you've changed the features versus whether it's just I'm raising the price on the shoes that's been there a long time. And so those are things that we work very closely with the vendors with and think through what makes sense.","Lauren B. Peters","Our ASPs increasing are -- there's a couple of factors that are involved in that. If we're doing more full price selling, you've got higher average selling price. And the fact that our apparel business has become more branded unless multiunit 5 for $20 T-shirts, that has raised prices in apparel. And as that becomes a bigger part of our business, that contributes to higher ASP.","John A. Maurer","Okay. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Eric Tracy from Janney Capital.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess, it's been asked a few different ways, but I'm going to try again here. In terms of possibly getting a quantification of the -- what's embedded in the mid-single digit guide for this year, what type of comp lift do you expect from the remodels? Is it possible to get that?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we've -- they will grow faster than the store. Remember, mid's a reasonable range. They will grow faster than the store, but it is 10% and 15% of a portion of the chain and it also is only part of the year. So you take a 10% to 15% of a portion for part of the year, it is not a huge number of this year. As we continue to grow and expand it, it becomes a much bigger factor. But this year, it's a lot of mathematics when you look at, multiply 10% times a fraction times a fraction.","Lauren B. Peters","And it's a reality that the project takes time. So there'll be some period of time, days, while the store...","Kenneth C. Hicks","And some -- yes, some of those stores, that's exactly right, particularly with the Champs stores. The stores are closed. So we lose sales for those days that it's closed.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. That's really helpful. And then, Ken, I guess, a broader, more strategic question. Given the perceived cyclicality of a product pipeline in the business and sort of the belief in the market, right or wrong, of this has been a great comp story in driving structural margin in the turn, how do you think about, again, just strategically, starting to shift more towards a unit growth? And obviously, Europe is probably going to be the driver of that. Is there an ability to accelerate that, exploit a little bit of the market dislocation over there to start to transition to some actual unit growth?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, we think that Europe is a place that would provide significant unit growth and that's why we're expanding there. We also think that some of our banners provided opportunity where we pulled back on, for example, in the kids' business. That's our second area for unit growth. We also look, as we get women's -- the women's business and understand that, what format works best for that, that we can turn around and start growing those units. So you've got those 3 different things, coupled with the significantly improved productivity, that we would want to get over time from some of the actions that we're taking, that there's a continued opportunity for growth.","John A. Maurer","Okay. That's all we have time for today. Thank you, again, for participating on the call, and we look forward to giving you an update on our next call, which is tentatively scheduled for May 24.

[Operator Instructions]","This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views of future events and financial performance.","These forward-looking statements are based on many assumptions and factors, including the effects of currency fluctuations, customer preferences, economic and market conditions worldwide and other risks and uncertainties described in the company's press releases and SEC filings. We refer you to Foot Locker, Inc.'s most recently filed Form 10-K or Form 10-Q for a complete description of these factors.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John A. Maurer","Thank you, and good morning. I'm pleased that everyone could join us this morning to discuss Foot Locker, Inc.'s second quarter 2012 results. In our press release earlier this morning, we reported a 59% increase in second quarter net income to $50 million or $0.39 per share on a GAAP basis. This profit level represents the highest level of earnings from continuing operations of any second quarter in the history of the company as Foot Locker, Inc. This result brings the year-to-date earnings to $187 million or $1.21 per share, an increase of 43%, also the highest profit level the company has earned in the first 6 months of any year.","Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will begin this morning's prepared remarks with a summary of our second quarter and year-to-date financial results. She will also update our outlook for the second half of the year. Ken Hicks, our Chairman and CEO, will then recap our progress on some of the major initiatives we outlined earlier in the year at our investor meeting, initiatives which we believe can continue to drive our performance to new heights. Ken will also discuss the current business environment in the major regions in which we do business. And we'll, of course, allow time for questions after our prepared remarks.","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren B. Peters","Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. We were pleased to report earlier this morning that we sustained top line momentum in the second quarter, with a 9.8% comp gain, following the first quarter's 9.7% comp gain. And just as in the first quarter, we were able to flow those sales to the bottom line to produce record EPS results.","Our domestic stores comped up in the low-teens in the second quarter, with gains in every division except for Lady Foot Locker, which was essentially flat. Foot Locker Europe's comparable store sales were also essentially flat, down less than 0.5%. But total sales in Europe were actually up mid-single-digits, as we operated more than 30 additional stores in the second quarter of 2012 compared to a year ago. Our other international divisions posted mid-single-digit comp gains and our Direct-to-Customer segment posted an 18.1% gain, including a gain of almost 50% in our store banner Dot-Com sales. Coming on top of last year's Q2 comp gain of 11.8%, this year's overall comp gain marks the second consecutive quarter in which we have posted a 2-year stacked comp gain in excess of 20%. In fact, our 2-year stacked comp gain for the first half of 2012 is a strong 22.1%.","By month, we posted high single-digit comp gains in May and June, while July was up double-digits. The strongest division in the second quarter was Kids Foot Locker, which posted a comp gain in excess of 20%. Champs Sports continued its very strong performance with a comp gain in the teens, on top of last year's similar results for a 2-year stacked result of more than 30%. Foot Locker in the U.S. and Footaction also posted double-digit gains this quarter, on top of similar results a year ago.","CCS.com sales fell below last year by a low single-digit percentage, as it ran far fewer promotions this year compared to last, resulting in improved profit margins. Excluding CCS, the other parts of our Direct-to-Customer segment posted a gain in excess of 20% for a 2-year stacked gain of well over 40% for the second quarter in a row.  Footwear and accessories both had high single-digit comp gains, while apparel lead the way with a low double-digit increase.","Within footwear, the kids' business was stronger not just at Kids Foot Locker, but in almost all of our divisions that sell kids' merchandise. Jordan product, Adidas classics such as the Samoa, padded collar Chucks from Converse and Slides all had very strong gains. In men's footwear, basketball was once again the key driver. There were several Jordan Retro launches that pushed really well during the quarter. In addition, we had tremendous results in marquee players shoes, led by LeBron, we were happy to see get a ring and a gold medal, but also Kobe, Rose and Durant. The broader basketball business was very strong as well, as we continue to build on our leadership position in our biggest category with Nike, Jordan and Adidas.","Running was relatively flat overall, we continue to develop and differentiate our running and casual assortments to match the distinct customer expectations in each of our different banners. Sales of footwear were down slightly at Lady Foot Locker. But overall, we posted a positive comp in women's footwear, as gains in several other divisions were solid. Our positive results were driven by Nike Lightweight, Tech running, including the Colors That Run program from ASICS, Adi classics and Nike Prestige.","Apparel sales in the U.S. once again achieved a 20% comp gain. The total company apparel gain was low double-digits due to comp apparel declines in Europe and Canada. Graphic tees continue to be a major area of growth for us. And our Team Edition facility is busy producing T-shirts for several brands, as well as our own private label. We had particular success with Jordan apparel that hooked up with the major shoe launches. And we also saw significant gains in LeBron apparel.","Just as in footwear, the biggest apparel gains were in our kids' businesses. Overall, Brand Jordan was the biggest gainer. Apparel sales comped up double-digits at Lady Foot Locker, as we saw some early success with the improved apparel assortments in that banner. The accessories business continued to be strong for us. Both socks and hats were up double-digits again with socks led by Nike Elite, Nike multipack and Adidas. Snapback and NBA hats also saw big gains.","Turning to the rest of the income statement. Our gross margin rate rose to a strong 31.3% in the second quarter, an increase of 90 basis points compared to last year. We picked up 130 basis points from effectively leveraging our occupancy and volume costs. However, we gave back 30 basis points in merchandise margin and another 10 basis points due to lower shipping revenue from our online sales.","Let me focus for a moment on that 30 basis point decline in merchandise margin, which is a function of a few different factors. First, our merchandise margins in Europe declined, although the rate achieved in the quarter remains higher than our U.S. margins. We have been aggressive in taking the markdowns necessary to keep our merchandise in Europe fresh, which remains key to sustaining the healthy profitable business we have there.","Second, both our in-store and online operations in the U.S. carry lower merchandise margins than our international divisions. As the U.S. businesses grow at a much brisker pace than our international operations, the proportionately higher mix of U.S. business tends to compress overall merchandise margins. Our merchandise margin in the U.S. stayed steady in the quarter, even though our initial markup rate declined. We are seeing price increases from our vendors, and not all of these increases are passed on directly to customers in the form of higher retail prices. However, we have been able to reduce our markdown rates to offset the impact of the lower initial markup.","Thus the increases in average selling prices that we continue to see are a combination of higher prices from the vendors, some of which we pass on to our customers, and lower markdowns, which we achieved by continuing to execute the initiatives of our strategic plan. These efforts include differentiating our banners, making our stores and digital sites more exciting places to shop and buy and more effectively allocating our merchandise to make it more productive. And no discussion of margins would be complete without noting that overall, apparel margins remain below footwear margins. We've made good progress in the U.S. but internationally, where apparel margins are already higher than footwear margins, we did lose some ground with the tough market conditions, especially in Europe. We continue to work hard to improve margins in all product categories.","Turning now to SG&A. Our expense rate improved 120 basis points to 22.4% in the second quarter from 23.6% last year. SG&A dollars increased by only $5 million on a $92 million sales increase. Year-to-date, SG&A expenses have risen only $13 million on a $218 million sales increase.","The biggest driver of this performance is the disciplined approach we take in managing store wages. In fact, all of our divisions, including Foot Locker Europe, have improved their year-to-date sales for payroll hour metrics. We believe this performance can get even better over time, as we begin to capture the benefits of the new time and attendance system that we implemented in the second quarter.","Our depreciation expense was $29 million in the quarter, up $1 million from last year, while interest expense was flat at $1 million. Our tax rate came in at 36.7% in Q2, slightly better than the 37% we planned for, primarily as a result of a tax rate change in Ontario. This tax benefit contributed $0.01 per share to our earnings. Thus without that item, non-GAAP EPS in Q2 was $0.38 as opposed to our GAAP results of $0.39 a share. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation reflecting this adjustment will be included in our second quarter Form 10-Q.","The bottom line net income total of $59 million is the highest level of earnings from continuing operations of any second quarter in our history as an athletic company. Similarly, the year-to-date net income total of $187 million is easily the best result in Foot Locker, Inc.'s history.","Reflecting Ken's well-documented constant state of dissatisfaction, the entire team at Foot Locker, while proud of these results, remains far from satisfied. We see too many opportunities for us to improve our business further to be content. We have many initiatives underway to take advantage of market opportunities we see ahead of us, which we believe can drive performance even higher. And Ken will talk more about those initiatives in a few minutes.","First, though, let me give you a brief real estate update. We ended the second quarter with 3,354 stores, having opened 47 new stores and closed 62 so far this year. You'll recall that at the beginning of the year, we estimated that we would open 82 new stores and close 75. Our store openings are on plan, with the store count in Europe up by 20 year-to-date and several new highly productive House of Hoops stores open in the U.S. On the flip side, we now expect to close about 100 stores during 2012. We have identified opportunities to close additional stores, which we have been using to clear markdown merchandise. Given our significantly improved inventory position, it is definitely a positive that we do not need to operate as many of these clearance stores as we have in the past.","Speaking of inventory, we ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion in inventory, down $38 million or about 3% from last year, despite a 7.2% increase in sales. Weaker foreign currencies had a lot to do with the nominal decline. On a constant currency basis inventory was flat, and it was up about 1% on a per-store basis. The productivity of our inventory continues to get better overall, and we feel well positioned in all of our markets for the important back-to-school season.","We ended the quarter with $820 million of cash and short-term investments, an increase of $139 million from the end of Q2 last year. We spent $37.5 million in the quarter to buy back about 1.2 million shares, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase program to $64.6 million at a reduction of approximately 2.1 million shares. As mentioned on our last call, we have increased our projected capital spend for 2012 to $170 million. And just this week, we met with our Board of Directors to preview our potential capital spending program for the coming years.","It is still premature to discuss specific numbers because much depends on the degree of success of the various tests we are currently conducting and plan to conduct over the next year or so. But the potential exists to take up our capital spending significantly over the next few years. We continue to follow the model of first developing a prototype, making adjustments, and then thoroughly testing in order to understand the sales and profit potential before committing large amounts of capital to any project. As a result, our goal is to ensure that any capital spending scenario would enhance our financial performance over the long term while not disrupting it in the short term.","Let me touch on a couple of key topics for the rest of the year before I turn the call over to Ken. First, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about our business for the back half of the year. Given the trends from the first half of the year and our early back-to-school sales, we are positioning ourselves for comp sales growth at the high end of mid-single-digits. So far in August, our comps are running up double-digits, including a mid-single-digit gain in Europe. While that performance is of course very good, there are some shifts, including timing of certain launches, tax holidays and school openings that make reporting comps over such a short period less meaningful. That said, the momentum of our business is clearly intact globally.","In terms of gross margin, we continue to anticipate 30 to 40 basis points of improvement in the second half, with gains from leverage somewhat offset by pressure on merchandise margins. The primary merchandise margin dynamics I mentioned before, IMU pressures from our vendors and the higher growth rate of Direct-to-Customer and U.S. store sales compared to international sales, are likely to continue. Similarly, we still plan SG&A expenses for the remainder of the year to improve as a percentage of sale by 6 to 80 -- 60 to 80 basis points. That would equate to a full year rate decrease of about 100 basis points.","Our tax rate over the back half of the year is likely to be slightly higher than our previous outlook of 37%, as a consequence of the higher-than-planned proportion of earnings that are coming from our U.S. business, where the tax rate is higher than our average international rate. Blended with the favorable tax rate in the first half of the year due to some one-time benefits such as the Ontario rate changed, we're still likely to be close to 37% for the full year.","Finally, we have profit headwinds of about $0.01 per share in the second quarter due to currency movements. Using constant year-over-year FX rates, our EPS would have been about $0.01 higher in Q2 than the $0.39 we reported, and about $0.02 higher year-to-date. Assuming exchange rates stay where they are now, the exchange rate differential in the back half of the year will be smaller than it was in the second quarter, since the euro, in particular, started to weaken in the second half of last year.","On the other hand, our international profits are greater in the second half, so any differential has a somewhat different impact. Bottom line, we are still expecting headwinds of about $0.05 per share for the full year. This impact has been factored into our guidance of double-digit percentage profit increases in each quarter for the rest of 2012.","With that financial overview, let me give the floor to Ken so that he can discuss some key initiatives and the trends in our business. Ken?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for your participation on the call and your interest in Foot Locker. I'm very proud of the entire team at Foot Locker. We have achieved consistently strong financial and operational results so far this year. Our record of consistency goes back even further.","In 2011, we posted a 9.8% comp gain for the full year. Now this year we posted a 9.7% comp gain in Q1 and a 9.8% comp gain in Q2 having achieved, as Lauren said, an impressive 2-year stacked gain of over 20% in both quarters. In fact, we've now reached our 10th consecutive quarter of meaningful sales and profit growth. I believe this track record of steady improvement is a consequence of carefully executing the initiatives of the strategic plan that we first laid out more than 2 years ago, and which we continue to refine as we identify new and exciting opportunities to increase shareholder value.","Lauren did a great job highlighting the key drivers of the quarter, basketball, kids', apparel in the U.S., to name just a few. So before I get to your questions, I'm just going to spend a few minutes reviewing some of our key ongoing initiatives and where we stand at the moment.","From a store perspective, we have several exciting things in the works. We've talked in the past about our Champs prototype store in Florida. We now have 11 test stores open, so we can determine if the excellent results we got out of the prototype happened when the stores are spread around the country in different market situations. At the Foot Locker division in the U.S., we have a new prototype store opened in the Smith Haven Mall on Long Island and so far, so good. We have a number of Foot Locker test stores with some variations on tap for later this year and early next year.","We have a three-pronged effort with Lady Foot Locker. First, as Lauren mentioned, we've upgraded the apparel assortments in virtually all of our existing Lady Foot Locker stores and the initial results have been encouraging with a double-digit apparel gain there in the second quarter. Second, we're also in the process of remodeling 14 Lady Foot Locker stores in which we intend to really highlight the apparel offerings with much of the apparel assortments displayed prominently on the walls and with many of the shoes moved to the center of the store. Most of these stores are open now or will be shortly, so feel free to contact John after the call if you might like to see where the closest store to you is. Third, and finally, we intend to open 3 new concept stores for women before the holiday selling season. These stores will be merchandise significantly different than the Lady Foot Locker store with much more apparel, stronger coordination between shoes and apparel and more emphasis on performance. These stores will have a new nameplate over the door, which we'll announce later in the quarter. We are excited about the opportunity in the women's business, but we'll have to see how these various tests play out before making any decisions about the future direction of our Lady Foot Locker business or how best to apply some of the learnings to our other women's businesses.","Moving onto Kids Foot Locker. We have several test stores operating now with an updated look. And given the current strength of our kids' business, we're eager to get going with a further rollout. But we're just in the middle of the back-to-school season, so it's still too early to make decisions. In Europe, we've expanded beyond the locker room prototype store in Brent Cross that we told you about at the end of 2011 and now have 2 additional test stores operating in the U.K., with 2 more on the continent slated for later this year. We're also experimenting with additional Kids stores in Europe, which we think is a natural. In the meantime, we continue to expand the Foot Locker store count in Europe as planned. The business there remains profitable, and we're investing for the long run in Europe, which we believe will stabilize over time.","Lauren mentioned that we have more initiatives in the works than ever before. And you can see that we have a lot happening on the bricks-and-mortar front. But we're far from idle in the digital space. I feel we can do a better job of communicating all the exciting investments we have made and are continuing to make to position our online and mobile applications as the premier destinations in the industry. Certainly we believe no one is better plugged in than we are as to how our young customers want to be engaged and how they use technology to shop and buy. We are in a constant state of refinement and enhancement at Foot Locker. We recognize it is a necessity to constantly upgrade our technical capabilities to meet the quickly changing demands of our tech-savvy customers.","First, at our Eastbay business, we continue to build on the competitive advantage we have with the high-performance varsity athlete. We are constantly enhancing the functionality and engagement features of the Eastbay website with aspirational imagery, authentic athletes and storylines and features such as the Athletic Resource Center, or ARC. At ARC, our exceptional athletes can measure their physical performance against elite, world-class athletes with Close the Gap.","Football players can see from real players how equipment works on the field from cleats to pads to gloves and more, and from position-to-position with the Eastbay Edge. We also plan to leverage Eastbay's unparalleled reach to high school athletes and coaches, as well as very strong relationship with Nike to build a much more meaningful team sales and service business. We are strengthening the team sales organizations and have already started selling in California, and we're also positioning for the future growth in key states such as Texas and Florida.","Second, we're investing in expansion of our e-commerce business in Europe. We're now online including mobile applications in several countries on the continent in addition to the U.K., where we've been already operating for a couple of years. We have more countries rolling out over the next few quarters.","Third, we are strengthening the omnichannel experience for the customers of our various bricks-and-mortar brand banners in the U.S. We already have excellent award-winning Web and mobile sites that leverage the efficient infrastructure of our Direct-to-Customer model. We continue to introduce capabilities that clearly pay off, such as enabling online purchases to be returned to stores and buy online, pick up in store. We're supporting this with a mobile feature that enables shoppers to locate their favorite banners' nearest physical store.","We're testing the use of handhelds and iPads for both our associates and customers in the U.S. stores. We already have handhelds in most stores in Europe. And we're on the vanguard of testing new payment options from PayPal, Google Wallet and Isis. And we're exploring the use of WiFi for our customers. In these and other ways, we continue to align and feel the look and feel of our in-store experience with our digital retail space.","As a matter of fact, we held this week's board meeting at our Direct-to-Customer headquarters in Wausau, Wisconsin, where we showcased to our Board of Directors our existing capabilities and our plans to capture the ongoing migration of more and more of our customers to the digital space. The 50% increase in our store banner Dot-Com sales that Lauren mentioned early on during the call is a good sign we believe we're on the right track.","Turning to the macro situation, Lauren used the words cautiously optimistic. And I'd like to echo that sentiment when summing up how we see the athletic industry over the back half of the year. The pace of product innovation coming from our key vendors such as Nike, Adidas, Converse, Jordan, ASICS, New Balance, Mizuno and Under Armour is as fast as ever, and our customers are continuing to vote enthusiastically in favor of our assortments.","That said, we have an election coming up and a so-called fiscal cliff the country is approaching. So there's always the potential of an impact on the U.S. economy that we will have to manage through. And the future direction of Europe's economies in the short run, especially, is still highly uncertain. As I said though, we're investing there for the long term. But our business remains solid in the U.S., Canada and Australia, and it seems to be picking up in Europe with positive comps there in July and so far in August. We will continue to plan cautiously, but we believe we have the right product in the stores now for back-to-school and the right product coming up in for the holiday selling season. The Olympics have helped to expand awareness of quite a few high-profile athletes and several exciting new technologies. The NFL is already getting its season underway on time. And later on, the NBA season will also start on time. These elements all support an overall trend that continues to be positive for our industry.","To wrap up my remarks, I'd like to reiterate my appreciation for the hard work of the entire team that made our excellent second quarter and record year-to-date results happen. Their teamwork, both within the company and with our brand partners and other major suppliers, enables us to connect with our customers and reach new heights of customer satisfaction and financial performance. As high as we climb, however, we still see plenty of opportunities ahead, and we're determined to execute our strategies to reach even higher.","Thank you. Operator, let's open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And our first question comes from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","My first question, you guys mentioned that running was flat in the quarter, so wondering if you could give a little bit more color around the category and what might be behind the flat trends that you're seeing.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We have seen good performance in our Lightweight running and our technical running. Where we've had challenges is in some of the higher-priced Air running. And in units, we're doing well. It's the shift in the dollars. But we feel confident with some of the new Air product that's out there and the continued growth of Lightweight running that running will continue to improve.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then shifting over to Europe. It seems like the trends there are a little bit volatile, which is to be expected. What do you think is driving the most recent strength in July and August? Is it really all of the Olympic boost? Or is there something underlying that, that has helped the latest few weeks here?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, there obviously was some impact by the Olympics. But that was primarily in the U.K. We saw good performance as a result of some of the new product that we got, Lightweight running is one of the important new ideas. We also are seeing some very good performance on some of the classics like the Blazers and some of the shoes from Adidas. So we've implemented a new technology zone that is allowing us to sell more performance-related running product that's helped our business. And so you put all of those elements together, and we're seeing some better results than we did at the end of last year.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Are there some stores or countries in Europe that don't have the Lightweight running product just yet?","Kenneth C. Hicks","No. We've got the technology throughout all of our stores in Europe now.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then my third and final question actually relates to technology. You spent a little bit of time discussing the investments of where you're at right now. One of your larger competitors has made a big push into upgrading their technology systems really from front to back. Do you feel like there's a need for you to increase any of your expense or CapEx dollars to catch up with them?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We don't think we need to catch up with them. We think they're trying to catch up with us, quite frankly. We've had handhelds in our stores for a period of time in Europe, as I stated, and got them in a number of stores in the United States. We've had a very good distribution system -- I'm sorry, planning system in our company for a period of time and are now looking at an allocation system, which I believe they're looking at both of those. And we have been testing and trying different kinds of pads and screens in our stores for a period of time. We've spent a great deal of money making sure that we have very workable websites, both online and mobile. So I salute them for trying to catch up with us. But we've been pretty aggressive in this space. And I think our results show that we continue to make progress there. The thing we don't do is we don't try to clear a lot of products online. And it's one of the reasons why our online performance, I think our profitability is higher than theirs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess we can focus on quarter-to-date trends, up low double-digits, maybe just talk through again the various categories from basketball to running on the footwear side, what apparels kind of contributing to that. And then it does sort of seem based on the guidance that there is an expectation for that to moderate a bit. Again, maybe just how we should be thinking about that -- those trends for early back-to-school.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well right now, as we said, we're up low double-digits early this month. But I think that when you look at the business, running, as we stated, was flat. We had a strong performance in basketball, strong performance in apparel, strong performance in classics. Our men's and kids' business was good. Women's business continues to be a little bit more challenging at Lady Foot Locker. It's up overall, by the way, throughout the whole -- when you put the whole company women's business together, it's up. So we've got a lot of legs of the stool, as I'd like to call it, that are working. When you look ahead, I don't think that saying -- it's kind of funny when somebody says the upper end of mid-single-digits is conservative. That seems to me like we're stepping out a bit. But if you could tell me who's going to be elected, what's going to happen with the fiscal cliff and what will happen with the economy in the back half of the year, I could probably be more certain about how to plan. But I think we're planning appropriately based upon the trends and what we see, which from the vendors the product looks great. There's a lot of fantastic things that they're bringing out and we're working with. So I feel good about the back half, but I'm not willing to step out way too far.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And by the way, if you could -- anyone could tell us what those things are, we'd all make a lot more money. So maybe just in terms of the NFL license, how we should think about that in planning the business? It certainly seems like an incremental year-over-year boost. But how should we be thinking about you sorting the products going forward?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. We feel very good about the new -- Nike's new license of the NFL. They're being very aggressive with the product. The marketing of it looks great, and the season obviously hasn't really even started yet. We're going to have some very strong presentations. Champs will be the headquarters of that. We're going to have a terrific store set up in Champs. And we're going to have some stores that are going to have really spectacular setups. But all of the stores will be selling the hats. We'll have some of the apparel in some of our other stores. But Champs will be the headquarters and brick-and-mortar, and we'll have a very strong presentation online through Eastbay and through the champs.com -- champssports.com.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe lastly, Lauren, for you, just switching to the merchandise margins. Possible to sort of quantify the mix shift towards U.S., obviously growing in a faster pace, but maybe quantifying that, and then how we should think about sort of other opportunities, initiatives that you have in place that could support sort of offsetting that U.S. mix shift.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. So we talked about being 30 basis points of merchandise margin. The bigger piece of that coming as we worked through product in Europe to keep those inventories fresh, a smaller portion being the mix that we talked about with the strength in the U.S. and online business. So as we think about margin expansion, we continue to believe that as we do a better job of flowing our product and making it more productive, allocation being an area that we're investing in technology to get even better at our job there that, that will create opportunities for our merchandise margins to improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So let me just fine-tune something on Europe. As we think of the mid-single-digits that you said you're seeing in comp growth there right now, obviously there's some noise there based on the rest of your comments. Is that -- as we think about your guidance for global comps up at the high end and mid-single-digits, are you planning -- is that a comment baked in, kind of a run rate in the mid-single-digits in Europe? Or is there some leeway there?","Kenneth C. Hicks","No. We feel very good about what the European team has done and where they are. But our plans -- or our forecasts, I should say, for the fall season are not that aggressive for them.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Can you talk a little bit about the new labor planning initiative that you launched in the second quarter? And is that something that's rolled out to all stores now? Or is that something that -- and even if it is in all stores, I guess, is that something that can continue ramp as a margin contributor as you go forward and fine-tune it? Any color there would be helpful.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. It is, at this point, rolled out now to all stores in the U.S., and will be coming to Europe a bit later. Definitely, you should think about it as paying dividends over a longer-term as we become even more proficient at using it. So what it's intended to do is to get us even smarter about how we spend our hours to make sure that we're aligning with peak selling periods and that you have your very best salespeople at your very peak traffic times. So yes, it definitely is something that will pay out over a long period of time.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then one just for Ken, I guess. Ken, with all -- the number of initiatives you highlighted was pretty heavy. Which ones are you personally most excited about right now out of all the ones you've just talked about?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I love all my children, thankfully. I tell you what, the ones -- the most straightforward ones that we're seeing obviously are the prototypes and what's happening there. They also happen to be some of the more expensive. The kids' is very, very encouraging, and it's one that provides -- there's nobody in that space as strong as we are, and that's a great opportunity. I feel the women's opportunity, personally, is a terrific one for us again because that space, while there's some new entrants, we provide something with the brands and price points and quality and performance that nobody else does. And then finally, what we're doing in Dot-Com, and it's across 3 fronts, Eastbay, team sports and our banners. And as I said, we just reviewed it with the board this week, and they were -- I think they were very positive and felt very good about our team's capability and where we can get that division as we go forward on -- and I just mentioned some of the things that we're doing to improve our Dot-Com sales. They feel very good about what we can do there. So it's difficult to pick one out because we've got to make sure that we test and support all of them. One of the most important things is that we've divvied up the workload so that we can execute it and we don't -- the thing that I'm most worried about is that we buckle because we have too much going on. And the team feels pretty comfortable in our ability to execute against this.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Ken, price points have been certainly a part of the success driving the top line. Just a few questions on this topic. I guess first, could you just kind of speak to the change in mix and performance that you've seen of $100, $150, $200 price point items versus a year ago and kind of versus the product that are below $100 price points? Second, can you just kind of give us an update on where we are in regards to the inflationary pass through from the vendors? Is there still more to come? Or are we kind of somewhat done with that for the year? And just lastly, is there -- there seems to be a willingness to pay up for very unique attributes in footwear, whether it's the cutaways, the styles, the technology like Nike+ or events like the Jordan's Golden Moments Pack tomorrow. But as we approach like $300 price points for certain items, are you seeing any pushback at all on these higher price points? Or is the demand still much greater than the supply?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. The first point on price points, we are seeing price points go up, and we're working with the vendors to make sure they're thoughtful because there's some classic shoes that you try to maintain as close as possible. But then there are new shoes with new features where you're able to get more. Our average selling price has gone up, and we have seen -- I would say for the technology, look and important shoes, that's a growing classification for us, over $100 group, and so that's good. Part of the reason is some of the shoes that were under $100 have moved into the over $100, so there's more of an offering there. But we also -- we're doing a good job with Converse and the Chucks. And they're some of our largest group of lower than $100 shoes. But the growth is coming in the greater than $100 for us because there are more shoes there and there's more going on. With regards to inflation on costs, the cost for the shoes for the fall season is pretty well baked. We've already signed the purchase orders and those are done. And again, as I said, we've work with the vendors. We're seeing some pressure. Lauren talked about a little bit of pressure on margin, but it's manageable at this point because the prices have gone up. And it gets to your last comment, the customer has been willing to pay for the higher prices. I think there will be -- the big jump in inflation probably has occurred, but there will still be some continued cost pressure because of wages and things like that back with the manufacturers. But the customer is willing to pay for those high-end shoes. And in fact, that's where some of the larger increases have occurred because of the demand for them. And it hasn't slowed the demand. But we're also seeing, even with higher prices on a lot of the Lightweight technology, the customer has -- demand has not slowed down for those shoes either.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a few quick follow-ups. Can you -- will you guys quantify for us the sort of ASP component to that great same-store sales number you put up?","Kenneth C. Hicks","No.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you tell us if it's more than half of the comp for the quarter, ASPs?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We had increases in average selling price. We had increases in traffic. We had increases in conversion. So all the elements went the right way.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. And then for fall, you mentioned that you're pleased with the product lineup for fall and holiday. Is there anything new coming in on the apparel side that you can call out?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we're -- you're seeing more -- obviously, the NFL is a big plus, NBA. The Lightweight isn't just shoes, the uniforms that the Olympic team wore were over 1 pound less. I mean, I didn't even know they weighed a pound. But over 1 pound less than the old Olympic uniforms. And so we're excited about new technology in apparel. There's some new looks coming. Jordan\u2019s got some strong items that we think will be very, very good. And as their largest retailer, we feel good about what we have coming from Jordan. And then there's new technology in shoes, the whole Lunar idea, Nike+, miCoach. That technology is something that the customer is learning about and starting to get excited about. So beyond -- it's not just they're lightweight, there's technology and stuff. Probably though, the biggest thing that's exciting about both in apparel and in shoes is color. Right now, color is hot. You look at -- we ran the ASICS Colors That Run and we have terrific colors from Nike and Adidas. And New Balance has some phenomenal color shoes.","Lauren B. Peters","You couldn't miss the color in the Olympics.","Kenneth C. Hicks","No. And you couldn't miss the color in the Olympics, that's right. But that is one of the things that's really excited about what we're seeing because people need -- they've got to have 3 and 4 different pair of shoes to go with the different outfits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Parkhill from Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just curious if you could talk about your decision not to pass through some prices, what areas you didn't think you could, and the reason behind that given that your total comps are so strong.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, I think, quite frankly, that's one of the reasons why we didn't pass through all the prices. I mean, there's some shoes that they go over a natural price point or because of comparisons to other shoes and what the competition is offering, it just isn't appropriate to take up enough to capture and recognize that, that was only a small part. This is not a huge issue, but it's something that is real. But in order to keep the sales and in order to drive the leverage that we've got, there was -- and it's all very selective on the item decisions, and again working with the vendors because we are in a competitive market. We can't raise a price on a shoe and a competitor have the same shoe at a lower price and be competitive. So we've got -- we watch the market very closely to make sure that we have competitive prices so that we can drive sales.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then from -- just from -- I mean I know it's just a small part, but that headwind would most likely weigh in as we head into 2013, even expect price increases coming, given commodity costs or...","Kenneth C. Hicks","Say again?","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Would you expect some of your price increases to slow heading into 2013?","Kenneth C. Hicks","No.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I think that based upon the business and what's happening, what I think you will see is more value. There's more being put into the product. And so while the price may go up, the customer is willing to pay for it, either because of the look, the technology or whatever. So there will be some continued price increases. I don't think it will be at the rate that it has been.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The apparel strengths during the quarter was great to see. But I think in Lauren's prepared comments, she noted that the merchandise margins in apparel were still below that of footwear. And I just was wondering, is it a matter of accelerating the sales in the full price sell-through of apparel to get those margins above that of footwear? Or is there still mix changes that you're making in apparel? And can you update us on your view of private label?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Kate, it's really 3 things. One is the shoe margins continue to improve so that it's chasing something. Two, there are some things that we're looking at in terms of mix, as we continue to exit some of the lower-margin commodity businesses that we did in the past and move into more branded and more performance-driven apparel. And the third thing is, and we're in the process of doing this, is developing a more -- a stronger, more effective private label program, where we can get stronger margins on our own private label. So it's putting all 3 of those elements together. I'd say the first one, I don't want to change. I want to keep chasing the footwear. But the last 2, getting that mix right with our brands and building a private label business that's more effective.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then my second question, and I know you're still in the very early stages of your new concepts in ladies and the changes that you're making at Lady Foot Locker, but is the thinking with the other concept you announced today, if it works, would that be a replacement? Or would that be in addition to Lady Foot Locker? And with regards to again, the new concept, are we -- can we expect to see other brands that you don't currently carry? And is the store going to be bigger or smaller on a square footage basis?","Kenneth C. Hicks","The store will be bigger. It will be focused on the brands that we have. But it will have more, because it is bigger, it will have more product and product that you might -- or that I know you wouldn't see in a Lady Foot Locker or other places just because it will be big enough to hold more of it. We will have to see the performance versus Lady Foot Locker. There may be room for both or we may have to choose between the 2. Right now, it's a gleam in the eye. And I'll feel better about what's happening. I've seen the new Lady Foot Locker, the 14 prototypes, and it looks very good. Now we've got to see how it performs. And we'll do this new store, the renderings and the floor plan and everything look great. Now we've got to see how it looks on the floor and how the customer responds to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just a quick question. When you made that comment about quarter-to-date trends, shifts in the calendar, tax-free holidays, can you just clarify what that is and how much of an impact, if you could quantify, that has on that double-digit performance?","Kenneth C. Hicks","There are always changes, one state will move up, and there are only a couple of states where the tax freeze really do matter, and they are comped to last year. And we've had a shift in a launch shoe that we've moved up a little bit, but then we've got some other launches that are coming. So I would say it's a nominal difference. And I could tell you at the end of the month whether it was more positive or negative. But it's just -- some things got moved up and some things got moved back. We think they offset each other come, but not sure exactly how much.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I guess, I'm curious with regards to some of the prototypes in the talk, Foot Locker and Champs. And I guess, Lauren, your comment about how we start to think about CapEx in upcoming years, you must be encouraged by at least some of the things you're seeing and some things you're developing. And can you maybe just talk for just little bit on what that might be, what they might be and how quickly, potentially, if it does work in check, you can ramp up those remodels? I mean, are we talking several hundred a year? I mean, just any -- I know it's a little ahead of the game but just any thoughts there.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we're pleased with some of the early rollouts and some are more extensive than others. And they happen -- Champs is more extensive than Kids. And so they -- there are several variables that are included. One is how good they perform. If they're off the wall, we'll move faster than if they're just good. So that will be a determining factor. Two, is for some of these, like Champs, we've got to close a store for a period of time. You guys are pretty tough and we close bunch of stores. There's a negative there, and we don't get the positive quite as quickly, so we've got to manage that. And the third is just our capability to absorb all this. This is a lot. But we would like to think -- and in fact, one of the things that we've reviewed are different scenarios, kind of low, medium and high of what we can and can't do and within each of the different divisions. And so depending on what the reads are, we'll make a determination. One, we may move out faster than another because it's stronger. But right now, we think that they at least look promising.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then last question I have, just real quick here. On the second quarter, does -- when certain brands maybe grow faster, call it maybe Nike, which theoretically might have lower product margins than other brands or certain concept, Kids versus your core Foot Locker chain or Champs grow faster, does that have an impact, to some degree, on your product margin rate? Does that have any impact on the second quarter?","Lauren B. Peters","Well, all of those things are elements to mix. But I think it's pretty granular to sort of pick all that apart.","Kenneth C. Hicks","I mean there's all factors, but we don't disclose them. We manage them.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. As long as it generates high gross profit dollars, then it all leverages to the bottom line.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Zolidis from Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Most of my questions have been already asked and answered. But I just want to confirm, Ken, that you think that footwear ASPs can continue to rise in FY '13. And then I guess, why do you -- what do you think is going to be the main driver of that?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, I think it will be moderated some. It's not going to be huge increases. But the reason I think they can rise, there's a couple of reasons. One is the value that they're putting in the product, there's new technology, new looks, new ideas, and so the customers want those. And the second is the customer demand is there. We're seeing the increases and the response to the customer for the new product is strong. So I think that they will continue to react positively as long as we continue to offer great product for them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions, real quick. On the gross margin, Lauren, how did the FX affect the gross margin by itself?","Lauren B. Peters","FX, $15 million to gross margin.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then just to clarify, Ken, I think there's -- when you talk about your margins, there's a big difference between your initial markup and your markup on goods sold, I assume, and your cleaner inventories and everything. Despite the fact that your IMUs may not be increasing as greatly as they used to, your markup on goods sold is higher because you're running a cleaner, faster-turning inventory. Is that just the right way to think about it?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. The squeeze is on IMU, not necessarily on the margins.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. Because I think people are confused about how you're speaking about it, so I mean just to be clear...","Kenneth C. Hicks","That's helpful. Because yes, when we're talking about the IMU squeeze as opposed to the gross margin squeeze because we continue through better planning and allocation, fewer markdowns, a cleaner inventory to deliver good margins.","Lauren B. Peters","That's the dynamic. You've got pressure on IMUs. It's that just more pressure to do a good job in managing the inventory, so your markdowns are lower, therefore your margins are better.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. I know exactly. And then lastly, on the apparel initiatives that you're working on, I noticed in -- I was out in the store in Smith Haven. Are you working on basically getting most out of the nested tables and doing more hanging, which will free up salespeople, present the product better and help drive better sales in apparel?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We're playing down significantly those commodity products that are not -- or don't really, quite frankly, fit with what we're trying to do. And that's what those big tables were for. So you're going to see more presentation, more coordination, more fashion product than just cotton by the pound.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And that's mostly going to be hanging.","Kenneth C. Hicks","A lot of it will be hanging. I mean, one of the things that you will see, you go in the store and just look up at the walls and you see the T-shirts. And the T-shirts will still be on the tables, but the customer uses like a menu, \"I see that, okay that's the one I want, here it is,\" and shopping that way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bernard Sosnick from Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","What you've given us essentially is the outline of an overarching theme of an evolving Foot Locker. I'm not going to ask you to give us the new 5-year plan. But essentially the company, you're saying, is going to be transformed over the next 3 to 5 years through the rollout of new prototypes. Could you just give us, in the broadest brush terms, what you think this is going to mean in terms of an evolution over a several-year period?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, the thing obviously with more exciting, engaging store environments, a much stronger Direct-to-Customer business, be it mobile or online, a better connection between those 2, a much stronger element of quality that we will be positioned for the long term. We've had the same format in our stores for 20 years. We've not -- we in the past did not have our channels connected. We now are working, recognizing that the customer wants the great environment, wants the channels connected, wants to have the information, wants to have and is willing to pay for quality performance product and fashion and look that, that will position us for much longer than what we're going to do the next quarter.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Essentially, you're also saying that Foot Locker in the past had a homogenous offering, and you're going to more lifestyle, so there's going to be a greater variety of product offered in the athletic footwear-inspired business. What are your thoughts with respect to how the mall will be changing with respect to athletic products?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, I think the customer's looking for alternatives and places that they can go to, to get product that's both exciting and also fashion, performance, all of those things together. There's a great trend. You look at what people are wearing now, they're wearing more active apparel. We're fitting in with that and we're the place to go for brands. And I think the mall will be an important element of that. But you've got to connect it with the broader assortments and information that we have online. \"Well, I need a different size, I want a different color, I want something.\" We offer that capability. \"I want to know more about what this shoe does for me, whether I pronate or supinate. I want to know was this the shoe that Durant wore when he won the World Cup.\" All of those different things are elements of where we're working. And I think that these pieces, while they're individual, when you put them together will provide that exciting new environment and connectivity for our customers.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Can I ask one other question with regard to handhelds? Finish Line, Macy's, Nordstrom say they have handhelds that will provide inventory information within the stores and the ability to find the item, color, size in another store if it's unavailable at a particular store or to have it shipped from a distribution center or another store to fulfill the order. Is Foot Locker equipped to do that now?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. We have -- our handhelds do both administrative jobs, inventory, receiving the packages. But they also -- and the ones we have, and we're testing a couple different versions of them, which is one of the reasons we haven't rolled out is trying to make them more functional and easier for the associate and the customer to use that will provide whether or not I have it in the back room, so I don't -- \"I'm sorry, ma'am. I don't have that in 7.5, but I've got it in an 8. It runs a small. If you'd like, I could go get that or I have it in this color.\" So they can do that selling right on the selling floor, help them. The second thing it will allow them to do is, \"We don't have it here, but the Foot Locker down the street has it. You can go there, and I can reserve it for you or I can have it shipped to your home or shipped to the store.\" And it can also -- \"Oh, you'd like to know a little bit about that shoe, how much it weighs, here's the information on that.\" So provide all of that right there in the associate's hand to be able to deal with [indiscernible].","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","I'm very pleased that you've clarified that, and it's clear that you're not being left behind at all.","Operator","And our last question is from Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Samuel Lee - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Sam Lee in for Omar. Ken, I have a couple of questions. It seems like in the U.S. in particular, you guys are nicely outperforming relative to your competitors. Are you seeing a similar relative outperformance in Europe? Or can you speak to sort of what you're seeing in the region?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I would say that we are performing as well as most people there. But Europe's a different environment. Because in Europe, we're the only real pan-European retailer in our space, and there are local ones in each country. And so in some countries, we're doing very well. In other countries, there might be a competitor that's doing as well or possibly even better than us. So it's difficult to say across the board we're doing better or worse. I would say that we are doing as well as on average as any of the competition. It's a challenging environment for everybody. One of the things that's happening is there's a lot of impact on some of the weaker merchants, and a number of them are going under. And in fact, there's been quite a bit of press about the U.K. I will tell you, we're doing much better than what some of the press has been written about some of the competition in the U.K. So I would say we're doing as well if not a little better in Europe than most of our competitors. But it's not a pan-European, it's country-by-country.","Samuel Lee - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And my second question was on the Nike Flyknit. I think previously you had indicated that you expected to have the shoe in select Foot Locker stores. I was wondering if you'd be willing to share sort of your initial reads on that particular product and sort of where you think it could trend over time.","Kenneth C. Hicks","I think the product will be terrific. I think it offers a lot in terms of look, weight, performance. But I can't tell you how it performs because we don't have any yet. We're getting them in some select stores, as you said, in the different chains and in the different countries in the next couple of months. But I wish we could have a lot more. I wish I could tell you, but I haven't had any yet. But I feel very good about the product.","John A. Maurer","All right. That's all we have time for now. Thanks again for your participation on today's call.

This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.70 in the third quarter on a GAAP basis, driven by a comparable sales gain of 4.1%.","For the first 9 months of the year, Foot Locker has achieved a comparable sales gain of 3.7% with flat gross margin, leading to an earnings per share total of $2.04, an increase of 7% over the same period in 2012.

As John mentioned, we generated a 4.1% comparable sales gain in the third quarter, in line with our previous guidance, and with a solid result, especially coming as it did on top of last year's strong 10.2% comp gain. Many of the sales trends we have discussed with you earlier in the year remains intact in the third quarter. For example, our Direct-to-Customer business continues to be the fastest-growing segment, with a comp gain of 13.7%.","Within the Direct-to-Customer segment, our store banner.com business was up 40% again this quarter. Eastbay was up mid-single digits, and CCS' sales were down in the quarter.","Within the store segment, our kids business was also very strong again across all our banners that sell children's product. Kids Foot Locker itself was up high-single digits. Elsewhere in the U.S., the domestic division that rebounded the most in Q3 was Foot Locker, which was up strong mid-single digits after being down last quarter.","Footaction's comp was flat for the quarter, an improvement from its second quarter performance. Lady Foot Locker had a mid-single-digit comp decline, while Champs Sports, which was again actively remodeling stores during the quarter, comps down slightly.","Outside the U.S., Foot Locker Europe continued to post solid gains in the mid-single-digit range, with 15 of the 19 countries we operate in comping positive. While Germany was one of the strongest performers, Spain and Italy were 2 of the exceptions. The Runners Point Group posted a solid mid-single-digit comp gain, led by their online business and the Sidestep banner. Please note, however, that RPG sales are not yet part of our comparable store sales base.","With 20 more Foot Locker stores open in Europe now compared to a year ago and with the inclusion a full quarter of RPG sales, approximately $72 million, our total sales in Europe increased more than 25% in Q3.","Rounding out our international businesses, Foot Locker Asia Pacific was up mid-single digits, while Foot Locker Canada was down low-single digit.","For the third quarter, sales gains were driven by average selling prices, which were up low- to mid-single digits depending on category. Footwear units were also up, although units were down on apparel and accessories as we continue our transition to premium assortments, away from more basic product.","For the quarter as a whole, traffic was down slightly, although the trends did turn positive in October, which we believe bodes well for the holiday season.","Turning to our families of business. Another trend that continued in the third quarter was that our sales were led by footwear, with a mid-single digit comp gain. Apparel and accessories were down low-single digits. Within footwear, kids increased the most, up double digit, while men's footwear was up mid-single digits. Women's footwear, on the other hand, declined at a high-single-digit pace.","Men's footwear was led by basketball, which was up double digits. Running was up mid-single digits as well, led by strength internationally and in our direct business. Our casual category was down overall, although as Dick will mention shortly, there were important elements of success within that category, too.","As previewed on last quarter's call, August comps were up mid-single digits. September was up slightly, and October's comp was a very encouraging high-single-digit gain. In fact, all of our divisions, except CCS, comped positive in October.","As you know, all the big volume weeks in the fourth quarter are still ahead of us. However, our comp gain for the first 2 weeks of November continued at a mid-single-digit pace. After that, our results are not really comparable since this week last year was Thanksgiving week, and we were well along into our very successful Week of Greatness.","This year's version of the Week of Greatness officially starts tomorrow, although we actually have some great product releases from Nike and Reebok starting today.","Moving on to gross margin. Our rate was flat in the third quarter at 33.1%. Again, many of the same dynamics were at work in the third quarter that we have mentioned in previous calls. First, we did leverage our fixed occupancy and buying costs by 10 basis points. Recall that we had a significant sale shift, where it's about $36 million out of Q3 into Q2 due to last year's 53rd week, so we were pleased that we were able to produce this leverage.","Second, similar to our experience in Q2, our initial markup rate declined 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We did manage to lower our mark-down rate, almost enough to offset this IMU pressure. In the end, merchandise margin dropped 10 basis points, leaving the overall gross margin rate flat.","Turning to SG&A. Our rate edged up 10 basis points to 21% from 20.9% in last year's third quarter. We mentioned in last quarter's call that it would be difficult to achieve leverage in Q3 due to the sales shift. However, excluding RPG, our base business did achieve leverage of about 40 basis points despite the shift. On a full year basis, our SG&A rate has improved 30 basis points, inclusive of RPG. Depreciation expense was $35 million in the quarter, $5 million higher than last year. Depreciation for the base business was expected to, and did, increase by about $3 million due to remodeling and other investments we are making in our store fleet, as well as in various digital and technology initiatives.","The incremental $2 million in depreciation was related to the assets we have acquired with the Runners Point business. Our tax rate came in at 35% in the quarter, up from 31.7% last year. As John noted, this quarter, we recorded a $0.02 a share benefit related to lowering our foreign tax provision. This compares to last year's third quarter, when we recorded a $0.06 a share benefit. Without these onetime benefits, our tax rate would have approximated to 37% run rate that we plan for our business.","Our pretax income of $160 million in the third quarter was $5 million higher than last year, although net income was actually slightly below last year due to the larger tax benefit a year ago. Nonetheless, EPS this quarter was up to a record $0.70, as a result of the $167 million we have spent to buy back 4.8 million shares since the beginning of the year, including $67 million that we spent in the third quarter.","Our non-GAAP earnings of $0.68 was also a record. As I mentioned, we continue to execute our various capital expenditure initiatives, including remodels, new stores and upgrades to our online, mobile and systems capabilities. Year-to-date, we have spent $157 million in capital. We currently expect capital expenditures this year to end up around $210 million, slightly below the $220 million target we set at the beginning of the year. The difference relates mainly to cost efficiencies that we have taken advantage of as we ramp up our remodel program. We have maintained the pace of investment in our growth initiatives.","Inventory increased just over 6% in the quarter to $1.3 billion, about even with our overall sales gain of 6.4%. However, excluding Runners Point Group inventory and using constant currencies, our inventory was up just 1.2%, compared to our 4.1% comp gain. We believe that our inventory position going into the holiday season is in good shape to facilitate full-price selling, similar to what we executed in the third quarter. We believe we're on track in Q4 to deliver on our full year guidance of a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit percentage EPS increase. That guidance was based on a non-GAAP 52-week EPS result of $2.47 in 2012.","Now to tell you about the product highlights in the third quarter, here's Dick.","Richard A. Johnson","Thanks, Lauren. Since you already provided high-level statistics about our third quarter sales results, let me dive deeper into what was working and what was not.","Basketball footwear was up double digits, and the single biggest driver was brand Jordan. When you have as many different banners and geographies as we do, there can be some exceptions to such statements. But one thing was consistent for all of our male banners across of the globe, Jordan product was a very big hit with our customers. Whether it was Jordan performance product, the very strong retro releases or the Jordan footwear classics, the brand delivered powerful growth. And it wasn't just in footwear. Jordan apparel, such as tees, shorts and fleece that hook to the shoes, performed very well, as did accessories, such as socks. The U.S., Europe, Canada and Asia Pacific all had big gains in Jordan.","Foot Locker and Champs Sports also had strong basketball gains in Nike performance and marquee player shoes from Lebron, KD and Kobe. From Adidas, D. Rose is making a good comeback, both on the court and with the signature shoes in our stores, and I don't think he has nearly reached his peak in either area. Running footwear was also up, although in running there has been a bit of a shift in the preferences of our consumers. Nike Free sales are still increasing, while growth has slowed in some of the technical brands, such as ASICS and Mizuno.","Sales of these brands are still on the rise, and we're optimistic about the Kayano 20 from ASICS and the Prophecy 3.0 from Mizuno. At the same time, innovative new products, such as BOOST and SpringBlade from Adidas and Flyknit and Roshe Run from Nike, have definitely been a big hit with our customers. We continue to see strength in sales of these fresh new products.","Our casual footwear sales were down overall. We continue to see a slowdown in Converse and seasonal products, such as sandals and slides. We did experience increased sales of vulcanized product from Vans and Nike SB, as our customers continue to shift into these newer lifestyle programs. Ironically, some of the so-called newer programs are actually reintroductions of classic styles. For example, in addition to Vans, we've seen good life in New Balance, especially in 574s and in Timberland. The early strength of the Timberland business is making us more optimistic about boots during the upcoming season.","As Lauren called out, apparel and accessories were down a bit. Jordan brand apparel was up, and we still sell a lot of branded tees and shorts. The uniform of the kid hasn't changed dramatically, but the looks and style are shifting a bit. We're working to adjust to these changes. We're continuing to offer premium differentiated athletic product in our stores and online, and we feel we are positioning our apparel assortments well, telling different stories for each banner going forward.","We are also seeing a nice apparel lift in most of our remodeled stores, which we believe also bodes well for the future as we roll out more of the new formats going into the holidays and next year.","On the Accessories front, premium socks continue to do well. I mentioned Jordan already, along with Nike Elite and other performance socks. Our kid is finding new ways to differentiate himself, whether that's with knit hats, which are a big trend right now, or with a premium backpack that often hooks to the key color waves of our footwear and apparel.","In terms of apparel sales penetration, although we've gone slightly backwards recently, we still believe in the long-term opportunity to build apparel and accessories back up to around the 30% level it was a decade ago. And the margins can improve even further, as we elevate our apparel assortments to tell the targeted premium stories our customers expect from each of our banners.","Before I turn it over to Ken, let me update you a bit on the women's business. As we said, Lady Foot Locker comped down at a mid-single-digit pace in the quarter. Unfortunately, we didn't really pick up that business in our other banners, where the women's business overall was also down. That said, our women's business did increase internationally and online, so we know the potential is there.","Moreover, we continue to get good results from our SIX:02 and parks format Lady Foot Locker stores. The parks format is what we previously called our reskinned Lady Foot Locker doors. We have 6 SIX:02 doors currently operating with 1 more opening next week. We also have 19 parks format stores. Both types of stores are comping up, which is good news, but we're continuing to make adjustments to both formats as we need to optimize their performance before we decide on our rollout strategy. For example, the newer SIX:02 stores are a bit smaller than the original stores, and we have rearranged the apparel collections to display the product by category instead of by brand to better align with the way she shops. We plan to continue building the SIX:02 brand, developing the associate culture and reaching out to the local communities where we have stores. We believe that over time, we'll be helped significantly by the recent launch of the SIX:02 website, which should enable a much wider audience of women to connect with the brand.","Our focus remains on an athletically active young woman. She works out, perhaps by running, taking a spin class, yoga, dance or CrossFit training. She wants to look good while she does her activity. She needs the right fit, and she expects here to have the latest performance attributes to help her reach her fitness goals. We are doing quite well with that product, while transitioning away from the lifestyle or pure fashion product that we typically sold at Lady Foot Locker.","Meanwhile, we are working to improve the performance of the rest of the Lady Foot Locker chain. We are testing additional merchandise changes in our top doors, which are working well so far. We'll continue to close or improve underperforming stores as we position ourselves for a decision point on our rollout plan for SIX:02 or Lady Foot Locker, or potentially both.","With that summary, I'll turn the program over to Ken.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Dick. And I'd like to welcome you all to the call. Thank you for joining us. I want to first thank everyone at Foot Locker team for the results we announced today because it certainly took a team effort to produce the very solid quarter we did in the challenging retail environment we're facing.","I was particularly pleased that we produced our 15th consecutive quarter of sales and EPS growth, both on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. With the record non-GAAP performance we achieved last third quarter and the $0.06 tax benefit we recorded on a GAAP basis, it was a big challenge to improve over last year. But we pulled together as a team, drove improved sales momentum in most divisions, worked hard to flow the exciting new product from our vendors to our stores or directly to our customers, kept our margins steady, told strong marketing stories, invested in our associates in order to enhance our in-store effectiveness, began integrating a significant acquisition and utilized our strong financial position to buy back shares of our stock, all of which, together, contributed to achieving another quarter of sales and EPS gains. It was an impressive team effort. I think Lauren and Dick covered most of the important details of our third quarter results, so I'll just touch on a few points before getting to your questions.","First, Runners Point. The integration is going well. We've already started testing some banner repositioning that we think makes sense. We're not going to jump into any major changes yet since Foot Locker Europe and Runners Point Group both make money. There's no need to do anything quickly without testing it first. Runners Point Group did not make enough money in the third quarter to significantly impact our overall business. But the fact remains that it did make money, which is a good result for any acquisition in its first full quarter of operation.","Second, we've opened 77 stores, relocated 64 and remodeled 207 stores so far in 2013. We continue to get good list from the remodel projects we undertook this year. In most cases, the stores are outperforming the productivity standards we established for them.","We've completed about 10% of the Foot Locker fleet in the U.S., between 10% and 15% of the Champs fleet and most of the Kids Foot Locker stores. The vast majority of this year's projects are done now, and we set up for the big holiday selling season. We'll read the results over the fourth quarter before recommending to our board the specific levels of capital expenditures we want to devote to remodeling projects in 2014. But from what I can see so far, I would expect the pace to be similar to this year.","We also continue to roll out various shop-in-shop initiatives. We ended the third quarter with 112 House of Hoops locations: 103 in the U.S., 7 in Europe and 2 in Canada. We also now have 5 Nike Yardlines in Champs Sports and 5 Adi collective stores in Footaction. And just this week, we opened our first Nike Fly Zone in a Kids Foot Locker in New Jersey.","Finally, let me emphasize a point Lauren made earlier, which is that our Direct-to-Customer results continue to be very strong. We aren't yet to the point where store banner.com sales are 10% of our banner's total sales, but another quarter of 40% growth means we're definitely getting closer.","We're also now getting even faster growth in our Footlocker.com business in Europe. We're making the necessary investments to produce the best customer experience across the digital space, both online and mobile. Our customers want to interact with our brands everywhere: mobile, online and in stores. And they expect nothing less than complete integration from us. We're also leveraging the powerful Eastbay brand, driving sales gains both digitally and through our team sales efforts. We're developing new and innovative ways to take advantage of our brand assets as we position our Direct-to-Customer business to continue leading our sales growth in the future.","To sum up, we're excited about our opportunity to close out the year with another solid quarter. Lauren mentioned this mid-single-digit gain we're running through the first couple of weeks, which is a good way to start any month. But I want to echo our caution that the heavy lifting is still ahead of us.","That said, we're poised to jump-start the Week of Greatness today with the great product releases from Nike and Reebok. And tomorrow, we continue with exciting launches by Jordan and Adidas, and it pretty much goes on all next week. In fact, I know we're calling it the Week of Greatness, but with the significantly shorter selling period between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, I think we're set to keep up a good, steady pace all through December.","In the current retail environment, though, we define a good month as a comp gain in the low-mid-single digits, and that's still how we're planning the quarter.","Finally, our record performance this past quarter and so far this year supports our team's confidence that the ongoing careful execution of our current strategic initiatives, combined with our vision and our core values, will enable us to continue lifting our results towards the long-term financial and operational goals we set at the beginning of last year.","Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Also, Dick, you are hitting it on the nose, and that Derrick Rose has not come close to showing what he's capable of doing on the court. But turning to the business, could you just speak a little bit more about the adjustments that you are making on apparel? And you keep speaking about elevating the assortment, both from an apparel and footwear standpoint, to premium products. Are you leaving dollars on the table by perhaps not having more opening price point items?","Kenneth C. Hicks","The adjustments we're talking about are as we continue to grow our branded apparel business, we have significantly reduced our position in some of those opening price points. That said, we still have tees at 4 for $25. We have thermals. We have opening price hoodies. So I don't think we're giving up that business, we're just reducing it. We continue to work with our vendors to develop stronger assortments with -- in each of the brands. Our new formats that we're putting in place help us call out apparel more. And one of the things we see is stronger apparel selling as a result of that in those remodeled stores, which is one of the reasons we want to move on that. Also, the new initiatives, such as House of Hoops, Yardline, the Adi collective, also allow us to have a stronger apparel position. Dick, I don't know if you want to...","Richard A. Johnson","No, I think that sums it up. And on the footwear side, we talked about the Roshe Run, I mean, which is a great entry-level price point that the kids are very excited about. So I think the combination of a stronger brand in apparel business, the right entry level price point apparel pieces and great footwear across the price spectrum is really what's building our assortment the way it is.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just my follow-up will be on the Champs banner. You've done, I don't know, 10% to 15% remodel, 10% to 15% of that banner, yet sales were still down slightly. Can you just speak to the weakness? And then also, what is the relative gap of outperformance of the Champs that have been remodeled?","Richard A. Johnson","One of the challenges with the Champs remodels, as we've talked about, is that there's some closures involved with that. So as we ramped up the construction or the remodel program in Q3, there were weeks of closures based in those remodeled doors. And we haven't talked publicly about the lift that we're getting, but it's meeting all of our financial thresholds that we set in our process. So we're very optimistic about the Champs remodels and it's just a matter of getting enough of them open and not having them -- having others closed during the remodel process that we're looking forward to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Seth Sigman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions about the women's business. I guess, first, the Lady Foot Locker comps look like they were down mid-single digit in Q3. But overall, footwear for women, I think it was down high-single digits. So any color there would be helpful on what's driving that delta. And then, I guess, second, any more color on how the reskinned Lady Foot Locker stores are doing and SIX:02 is doing versus the overall lady's base at this point.","Kenneth C. Hicks","I'll do the footwear and then let Dick talk about the reskins and SIX:02. One of the challenges we've got with the women's footwear is we are making a much stronger positioning in the performance footwear and significantly downplaying the fashion. As we make that shift, it takes longer for the customer to find you with what you have new. But they can't buy what you don't have. So we're going through that transition now. We have said and know that transition will take some time. What we are seeing, our performance business is actually performing very well, it's just not offsetting the decline that we have as we pull away from the fashion business.","Richard A. Johnson","I think if we look at the SIX:02 and the parks format stores, as we get the merchandise assortment right, we feel very comfortable. And as I said in my prepared remarks, those stores are performing well. We've got 6 SIX:02s opened. I was off by about a week, I think, on the opening date. The seventh one opens actually in early December rather than next week. But we're very comfortable with where they're performing. And the additional tests that we've got going on is the merchandise tests across some of our better stores, where we're distorting the performance in active apparel, and as Ken said, moving away from some of those fashion silhouettes. So the initial results that we're seeing are positive. And we were looking to make a decision sometime next year as we watch the performance as we develop our rollout plan and our strategy to roll out either SIX:02 or Lady Foot Locker.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","This is Corinna Van der Ghinst for Kate. Can you please remind us where the European margins are now versus the U.S., how much opportunity you still see to take those up and how you plan to drive the margin expansion there?","Lauren B. Peters","We don't disclose the margins of the international business versus domestic. But historically, when we talk about merchandise margins, less promotional in our international business as opposed to the U.S. Certainly, our growth there, store count expansion, helps with that.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Okay. And I just wanted to clarify, Lauren, that you now expect full year comps up mid-single digits, not low end of mid-single digits as you had last guided?","John A. Maurer","Ken said full year guidance is low-mid-single digit.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Which, by the way, is mid-single digits. It's just we're in mid-single digits, we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Hey, Ken, I was hoping you could talk a little more about the initial markup rate outlook and sort of remind us when that could be anniversary-ed or what could cause it to go lower or higher from here. And then just a separate follow-up would just be a question on how you're thinking about maintaining the momentum in kids? Will that become more challenging against tough comparisons? And then as you look at holiday, there's a lot of noise out there about video game consoles. And I'm just curious if you guys had a comment on those and what that impact is on your core sort of teenage customer.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, the initial markup rate is something that we work with the vendors to make sure we've got the products priced properly. As the products -- since the products were forward bought in most cases, there are adjustments that occur from time to time. I think there will continue to be pressure on the markups. But we're working with the vendors to minimize those and keep those as tight as possible. So I don't see a big shift one way or the other, but I do see us continuing to work and we may pick up 1\/10 one quarter and lose 1\/10 to another quarter. But it's going to be -- it shouldn't be unless there's a major dislocation, a major adjustment one way into the other. With the kids business, there's no question that we've had a good run. One of the reasons that we remodeled the stores was to make sure that we maintain that run by expanding the assortment, both in shoes and apparel. And so I foresee -- I see, based upon what we're doing there for the near and intermediate term at least, continued growth in kids. We have a trend going on where the kids are -- more people are shopping with their kids with us. Dick and I were actually in a number of kids stores yesterday, and they were very busy, people bringing their kids to make sure that they have the best shoes possible. And the new format allows us to show more apparel and grow that part of the children's business, which, historically, had been the smallest penetrated apparel business that we had. So the kids business, I think, see, knock wood, continued strength there. And then, finally, the video games and stuff, the kid obviously spending money on those. They're big numbers. Fortunately, some of the biggest elements have already passed, and we had a reasonable result. So I guess, they aren't spending money on something, but they're buying both video games and sneakers, which is I prefer the speakers first, but it has not had an impact to date on our business. And we think that will weather because they only do this every so many years. We have sneaker releases more frequently than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I wanted -- Dick, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there was an apparel shift on the trend. If you could just give a little bit more color as to what that shift is, what parts of the apparel business it's impacting and if that at all impacts the margin potential that you have in the category.","Richard A. Johnson","The big shift is a little bit in the T-shirt business and the fleece business, going from verbiage tees to more clean, graphic sort of impressions on the T-shirts. And it's a somewhat normal cycle, and we just have to make sure that we get the inventory positioned accordingly. So -- but still, T-shirts, fleece and shorts that the core customers are buying, it's just a question of how they're embellished. And we work with our vendors to bring the best graphics and the best possible representations on those pieces. So I think we're in good shape, and I think we're getting the assortment balanced with where the kid is shopping.","Kenneth C. Hicks","The other thing, Camilo, I think, that's important to understand is our private label had historically been very much commodity oriented. And one of the things that we're doing now is making a transition from that. And again, that takes time as we build up our actual brand in women, as we build the Sneaker Freak line in Europe. And those have both been accepted very well. Our Champs Sports gear in apparel is doing well. And so we continue to make adjustments to that business. And so the transition is we've grown the branded -- or transition is growing at the -- getting our private brand back on track and making progress there.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Great. And then just on -- I just wanted to have a point of clarification on the current month-to-date comp. I think you said mid-single digits to the first 2 weeks. If we're talking about the current quarter-to-date comp, are you not providing that simply because the comparisons would skew downward with this week, but then skew massively upwards with the following week? Am I thinking about that comparisons correctly?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, through the early part of this week, things were open. Yesterday, we were closed. And so when we look at the number, we had a hell of a day yesterday comp-wise. It's just not comparative once you get to Wednesday, Thursday of this week because we're up against Thanksgiving. And then next week, it won't be comparative because we have Thanksgiving against non-Thanksgiving. So through the -- we thought it better to just through the first 2 weeks of this calendar weeks of this month, just staying they were reasonably comparative and we were in the solid mid-single-digit range.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Great. And it sounds like there's a good release calendar there ahead to maintain that pace.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We have...","Lauren B. Peters","Week of Greatness.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We have a Week of Greatness that actually goes on for more than a week. We've got the preview starting today and we go on after that. It's really exciting. The shoes we got coming are just...","John A. Maurer","Great ad campaign, too, yes.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, terrific ad campaign, if you haven't seen it. All is right with the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Wanted to follow up on the apparel discussion. Ken, did you talk about how you think about space allocation in the different stores, in the different formats? Apparel, obviously, has different needs than the footwear side of the business. And of course, much of the story is dedicated to footwear, of course. How do you think about being able to merchandise the apparel category effectively across brands and SKUs and silhouettes and sizes and price points, et cetera, given some of those space constraints or maybe you think about it, different brands or offerings in some of the different formats? And then I have one follow-up.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. We think about the space a lot, and it does vary by banner. And it's one of the reasons with our remodels, 2 things that -- or 3 things the remodels really do for us. One, they allow us to tell really good stories about the apparel and things and coordinate the apparel and shoes. Two, they are designed to best fit each of the banner's key characteristics. We -- if you think about the Champs, much stronger in apparel with the shoes down the middle. By the way, putting shoes down the middle on those bleachers didn't hurt the shoes sales, which was our concern. And that's -- so that's good. Foot Locker showing more how you can hook up the different apparel with the different shoes. We -- Dick and I last night, we're in the new Footaction format, and that's much more built around the lifestyle of shoes and apparel. So the second is making sure that the format fits -- or the layout fits the format in the space allocation fits that. The third thing is that these are designed to be flexible so that as the business shifts, and it could be a shift in the business or it could be a seasonal shift because you have different needs when you're selling hoodies, and in the summer, when you're selling shorts and T-shirts, we're able to make those adjustments and best show the apparel and the shoes to interest the customer.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful, Ken. And then, if I could, on Europe. I'd like to -- I'd love to hear your thoughts and kind of your long-term vision for the European market. It's obviously different in a lot of ways. It's more fragmented in different countries and languages. You've made the acquisition there. You have an existing store base. Is it outrageous to think that the European business, given the difference in how it's laid out, could look like the U.S. some day for you guys?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, I think, first of all, the European business, and you called it correctly, has differences because of the geography and nationalities. And so our assortment in Italy looks different than our assortment in Germany, and the Foot Locker looks different than our assortment in Great Britain. And that's one of the challenges that Lew Kimble Campbell and his team have to do, is adjust those assortments to the countries. And since we've done that, and actually Dick was the one who started it when he was over there leading our European business, we've had a much better performance. So that's one of the differences. We still have a number of countries where we're under-penetrated. And so we see a growth opportunity in developing over there recently in places like Poland and Turkey and the Czech Republic. And we've got opportunities there. The thing that I think is interesting with the acquisition and what it gives us is, one, the ability to strengthen ourselves in the strongest country in Europe. It was our #3 country, it's now moved to our #1 country. Two, a couple of banners that could possibly expand beyond the German borders and give us the opportunity to do something similar to what we're doing in the United States with multiple banners. I don't think Champs and Footaction translate that well into Europe. But I do believe that Runners Point and Sidestep can translate beyond just Germany. And in fact, they are, to some cases, but in Switzerland and Holland. But that's something that we will determine over time and see. And the third thing that it really did for us was strengthen our Dot-Com capability with the Tredex acquisition. So when you look at it, I think Europe provides an interesting opportunity for us. We said on the call, it' now up to 25% of the business, and the good news is, it's performing well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz from Robert Baird.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Let me start with Nike Fly Zone. You mentioned that. I think you're talking about one kids store. Could you just elaborate on that, exactly what is that, what's of the opportunity for that? And can that go beyond the kids business for you guys?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, it's a transformational space in the Kids Foot Locker store that's really focused on Nike and Jordan basketball product. If you think about it as a junior version of a House of Hoops, I guess, is the best way to put it, both from a square footage and a product perspective. So I mean, it's targeted at Kids Foot Locker. We've got one that's open. We've got 2 more coming. And as we've done many times, we prototype things. We test them, and we develop a rollout plan based on those tests. So we like what we see so far. But we're a week into the process at this point. So I think there is opportunities with the Fly Zone.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, Lauren, on gross margin, how should we be thinking about Q4? I mean, Q3 gross margin held up really well despite the shift in sales from Q3 to Q2. I guess, as I'm thinking about the different components of gross margin, it seems like, as far as buying and occupancy goes, maybe you guys can do a little better in Q4 than Q3. And then on the merchandise margin side, I don't know that the situation between markdowns and IMU really changes a lot. But again, I would guess in that gross margin can be a little stronger in Q4 than Q3. Is that the case or not so?","Lauren B. Peters","No, we certainly won't have the headwinds of the shift in sales. So yes, we should be able to do better on leverage.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Anything changing on the merchandise margin side for Q4 versus Q3 that you can see at this point?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, the dynamics remain the same, as what we've described. So we've got the IMU pressure, but we'll continue to feel really good about the position of our inventory, and so that should be able to help us on the markdown side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of things. The -- can you talk about how you're thinking about buybacks? You stepped up a bit in the quarter. How that's looking forward? Also, how to think about the D&A on a go-forward basis? It came a little higher than what we had anticipated. And lastly, just a clarification on the remodels you did -- you've done this year. You said 207. But you said on a prior call, you would do 150 in the third quarter, which would have gotten you to 270. So can you tell me what's right and what's wrong there?","Lauren B. Peters","Let's take our remods first. Remods, relos year-to-date were at 271, right? So that's the number. And so that's consistent. You got to add the relos with the remods. But on the share repurchase, what we described at the beginning of the year about our capital allocation plans remains intact. We really are looking to properly balance between investing in the business and making meaningful returns of cash to the shareholders through both that share repurchase program that we opt at the beginning of the year and the dividend, which we've also opt at the beginning of the year. So yes, the pace, $100 million in Q2, you'll recall that we were not able to do anything in the first quarter because we were in the middle of an acquisition and $67 million. So we're on pace at $167 million. We still have plenty of room to go on the $600 million.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And the D&A?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Depreciation.","Lauren B. Peters","Depreciation and amortization? Yes, so as we described, $35 million in the quarter, an incremental $5 million year-over-year. 3 of that that coming from the CapEx and the other 2 coming from the assets that come with the acquisition. So that would be the pace.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. But looking forward, I mean, should we be thinking about that as pretty much the number for the time being?","Lauren B. Peters","That's the pace, yes.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one other thing, on the remodeled stores. The -- what is -- has the change -- has there been a big change in the percent of apparel versus pre-remodel? So are you seeing, like in the Champs remodel, it might have been running at, I don't know what the percentage was, but has that -- has the footwear apparel percent changed meaningfully there? Can you talk a little bit about that and how that sets up for future expansions and so on?","Richard A. Johnson","We're seeing the whole ship rise, Sam. So the apparel penetration, based on banner, a little bit different by banner, is up slightly in some, not down in any. And then, as Ken mentioned, the whole thing we needed to make sure that we protected in a division like Champs is that the footwear business stays where it was. So we're seeing the remodels lift the whole ship, both the apparel and footwear. Not seeing a significant distortion in the apparel penetration.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bernard Sosnick from Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","The weather is cooler this fall than a year ago, which suggests you should be getting a little bit of a hint of how fleece sales are likely to perform through the end of the year. Could you give us some insight on that and a little bit of background history regarding apparel sales in the fourth quarter, fourth quarter a year ago?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, we're optimistic about fleece. As you said, Bernie, the weather is a little bit different this year than last year. The changes happen month-by-month. But our initial reads on fleece across brands and private brands has been positive. And I think that if you reflect back a year ago, the Northeast had the big storm early and then the cold snap that brought a lot of snow, or significantly colder temperatures a week or 10 days later. So I think the -- I'm not sure what normal is in terms of weather. But I think, over the course of the fourth quarter, it normalizes itself. And our fleece sales certainly reflect that.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","And just a clarification. With regard to share repurchases, what was the number that you were talking about for the full year?","Lauren B. Peters","We did not quote a full year number. I just reiterated where we are year-to-date, $167 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I guess, just first, on Europe. I'm just curious, there's obviously some new product that's been put into that market, Nike and Nike Free, the basketball business is working. Can you maybe just talk about what some things you guys might be doing specifically, how much of it is just new product coming into that market and just sort of your comfort and the sustainability of Europe comping? And then lastly, I guess, Lauren, maybe for you, what level of comp is needed in Europe to really leverage that business, given the store growth you have there?","Richard A. Johnson","I think it's a combination of things, Chris. I mean, if we look at the new product that's coming in, if we look at the emphasis on basketball, if we look at how important the running silhouette is in Europe, those technologies that we talked about launching over here are all important to the success of Europe as well. When we look at the dispersion of stores by country, we don't have -- we've been able to balance a little bit of our store distribution with the acquisition in Germany, making that now our largest country, probably with the strongest economy, certainly, in Europe. So they -- Lew and the team over there has been on a nice, positive trend. And based on the product that we see flowing, based on the things that we're doing, including some House of Hoops growth over there, we've also launched our remodeled Willowbrook format in a couple of test stores in Europe. So we see the likelihood that they'll continue positive.","Kenneth C. Hicks","The other thing, I think, that's happening is we're starting to see -- Europe had predominantly been a running market. And we're starting to see some strengthening in basketball in Europe, and obviously, that's to our benefit. Lauren?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, the dynamic fund on leverage, right, Europe stores, not different than the rest of the fleet, and that we can lever low-single-digit comps. But as you add new stores, of course, they come with some overhead with them. But we wouldn't expect those new stores to dilute overall ROS for that chain. So now you get the benefit as you add a new store in the subsequent years, years 2, years 3, that they're now comping and they get greater leverage.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. So leverage could really begin to happen at kind of the low-single-digit comp for Europe, correct?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, it's no different than what we expect for the rest of the business.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And is RPG accretive in the fourth quarter to the number, for Q4?","Lauren B. Peters","Well, on the base business, RPG, yes, but we will have integration costs in the fourth quarter as well. So it's not going to be a big number in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I just -- Ken, for you. One of the things that came out of the Nike Investor Day to me that struck me sort of interesting is they talked about moving to this consumer demand pricing model and highlighted basketball as a key category where they're really going to start testing some better price points. So as it relates to the IMU discussion and the potential for pricing to get pushed a bit and how you guys think about flowing that through to the consumer within the basketball category, be it Nike or Jordan products, any kind of early discussions on that and how we should be thinking about it?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, we talk to them about what we think appropriate price points are for shoes. And quite frankly, we've seen it. We've seen Foamposites go from $200 and $220 to deuce in a quarter, all the way up to $260. And we haven't seen a slowdown. So we've been making the adjustments over time. Interestingly enough, at the same time, we are working on the other end, when you put in things like Roshe, making sure that we've got some opening price. We also are looking at some of the soldier shoes to make sure we've got shoes in that $110, $120 price range. So we're working with them where appropriate, where there's demand, where there's a reason taking the prices up, but also not leaving everybody behind.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's fair. And I guess, just as it relates to the basketball category, it seems to be -- clearly, whether you do these lottery systems in sort of the gray market post those, the elasticity on the basketball category has some room to push. And again, it just seems like they were highlighting that category as a room for opportunity.","Kenneth C. Hicks","I think because they have a much stronger position in basketball, and therefore, they have more permission from the customer as opposed to running, which is, obviously, there are more players and somewhat can be a more competitive business.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes, okay. And then, I guess, just my follow-up would be on the women's business and the strategy between the concepts. I realize you're still very much in test mode between SIX:02 and the parks format on Lady Foot Locker. But what are the metrics? What are the sort of hurdles that you're looking at in assessing what the ultimate strategy is when you decide between the 2 concepts? Could you give us a sense of sort of timing, maybe the capital investment that may need to occur if there's going to be more significant remodels, just maybe more color there?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, there's a couple of different things going on, Eric. One is, obviously, looking at the performance and measuring the sales, the profitability, productivity and customer reaction. Is the customer excited about it? And then get some learnings about what markets may work better than others. So it's a performance and a market thing that we're looking at. At the same time, it does take time. It took several years before Lululemon moved out of B.C. I think some of our competitors in this are still being thoughtful as how they grow. We do have the capability, though, to push ideas into our Lady Foot Locker chain. And so part of our challenge is look at the new idea, how fast and where do we grow that, and take the existing idea and how can we strengthen that to make that more productive for the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can we just talk about the remodels from then here. As you think about the remodeled stores that are off-line in the third quarter, I'm guessing there's going to be significantly fewer closed in the fourth quarter, so you have the fleet open for the holidays. Is that a fair assumption?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. And by the way, the third quarter was also our highest remodel quarter of the year.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. If I -- so then, if I think about it, excluding those stores that were closed, it seems like the guidance for low and the mid-single digits implies a slowdown in the fourth quarter from the core stores, excluding that. Is there any reason for that? Or...","Kenneth C. Hicks","We do very thoughtful planning.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. As we think -- so then, as we think about the drag that you're seeing from having some of these stores off-line each quarter, is the dynamic of a drag from the off-line stores versus the lift from the new stores coming back in at a higher run rate becoming less of a drag each quarter that goes by at this point?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes. As we remodel and have more of the remodeled stores to offset the closures in the forward quarters, there should be less of a drag.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Which is one of the reasons why we don't call it out because over time, it starts to -- one starts to overtake the other. And rather than give us small adjustment every quarter, 1 plus or minus, because we also have different numbers in each quarter, we just say we will have -- we'll have some ups and downs, but they're not going to be huge. It'll be -- might be big for a chain, but not for the overall company.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then can I just ask about SG&A for a second and the fourth quarter, I guess, with remodeling? It seems like there's a pretty significant uptick in 3Q. Is that where you thought it would be, Lauren, in the quarter when you talked to us? Or was there any kind of shift there in the quarter?","Lauren B. Peters","The uptick in SG&A?","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Correct.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, so again, I go back to, I guess, a couple of dynamics there. We have a shift of $36 million of sales, out of Q3 into Q2. So there's some pressure on the leverage. And then we had a full quarter of the Runners Point Group. So if you get back to our base business, we actually did lever that SG&A by about 40 basis points in Q3. So we were pleased with that result. And then, really, it comes from a full court effort by our team that manage the costs, right? So we're very closely making sure that our selling wage hours are productive and that we're controlling all the other controllables.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, if I could just give one quick comment considering -- since you mentioned Timberland, and obviously, the weather has been pretty bad the last 2 years. With that in mind, have you guys taken a bigger position in boots or a smaller position in boots this year as we look at the fourth quarter?","Richard A. Johnson","We're optimistic about our boot opportunity in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if we could actually focus on -- back on Europe for a second. You called out Footlocker.com as being strong during the quarter. I was wondering, what are some of the drivers to that specific strength? Is that mobile? Or are there other drivers there? And then how does that compare now that you have Runners Point Group and Tredex? How does that compare to the strength or the growth in that business? Are the drivers the same? And then lastly, when you think about the platforms themselves between those 2 businesses, are they similar? Is one a little bit more -- have more technology, et cetera? Just how should we compare those 2 platforms?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, with regard to why they're growing, we are making significant investments, and they're both front and back. We've updated the websites now for Footaction. We're working on the other websites and improving there. We just implemented the SIX:02 website. And so we're making -- what the customer sees is a much better experience. As part of that, we're significantly stepping up our abilities with mobile. So we're seeing a significant growth in mobile. So we're pushing on the, if you will, the channel part of it, too. And the third thing is, on the operations side, we're making significant efforts and we're doing things like buy online, reserve in-store, buy in-store, have it shipped to you. Buy online, come pay cash in-store. We've put all sorts of different things to connect the Dot-Com with the stores. We're testing things like computers and adds in stores and different things so that we can have a much more consistent experience. With regard to Europe, Europe was just very, very small. Tredex gives us a platform. There are differences in terms of payment, obviously, the languages. And those are things that we are developing and also Tredex can help us with.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Zolidis from Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Question on the women's business. I think, Ken, you mentioned that you are shifting to performance away from the fashion side. So I'm just curious why you would want to do that.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Because that is a faster-growing, more underserved element in the ladies-only business. We still have the capability with our banners to serve that fashion customer. And by the way, she is more comfortable shopping in Foot Locker because she can -- in Foot Locker, she can buy in the kids department because, for example, Nike doesn't make Jordan in women's anymore, they make it in kids. So she'll go over to the kids department and buy a pair of Jordans. She also doesn't have any problem going over to men's, if she has a larger foot, and buy it in the men's department. So she -- that fashion customer feels more comfortable shopping in a Foot Locker than necessarily the Lady Foot Locker. We also change the target of the customers. The customers moved up from 15 to 25, to 25 to 35, and she is more physically active, cares more about how she looks and what she wears, while she caring about how she looks. And I think that, that provides us an opportunity. It's a very large market, over $40 billion, in the places where we participate and one that we know has not been fully and effectively served.","Lauren B. Peters","And that change in age demographic is speaking to our women's-only banner.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, women's only, whereas in Foot Locker, we still are able to take care of that younger customer, who feels comfortable shopping in there, whereas the more mature woman might not feel as comfortable shopping in a Foot Locker.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. So the performance declines at Lady Foot Locker are related to repositioning. So that suggests something else is going on with the decline in comps at the other banners, which have continued to be a source for a fashion customer as well. Can you just talk about what needs to happen to improve that side?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, one of the things that we've done, based on the demographics and the core consumer in each of our banners, we've removed women's from Footaction completely. So when you look at the total numbers, that went from a number to 0. So we're still rationalizing through that and need to anniversary that before we see the overall women's business. We're working in each of the banners to get the right assortment, as Ken mentioned, so that we can better appeal to that fashion consumer. And I think it's -- as we've talked about, our women's business is work in progress, and we were making progress in the women's-only banner. We continue to make progress in the other banners, speaking to different consumers.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. When do we anniversary the Footaction change?","Richard A. Johnson","Early next year.","Operator","Our final question comes from Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ken, I wanted to ask you just what you make of this reacceleration in the core Foot Locker business here through the third quarter and into November. I mean, it seems to me there's a broader pattern across all of athletic. Your peers are putting up better numbers. But as you look back at the past 6 months, you guys had 2 or 1 point in the second quarter, now 4. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic for the end of the year. So is there something that you changed strategically? Is it greater macro forces at play here?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I think that -- I don't know about the greater macro forces. I think one of the things that's happened is we've stepped up the product. In the summer, things lulled a little. But we're seeing more product for more vendors come out. We've got BOOST, SpringBlade from Adi. We've got some great new releases from Nike. You've got things like Roshe from Nike. You've got the Flyknits from Nike. Apparel has stepped up. We've made some of the adjustments in apparel that we've talked about as we look at the growth of fleece, changing what the -- graphics on the T-shirts. So I think you've got some product changes. We have -- we're doing a better job with the stores. We've got the remodels that are starting to feel some benefit from. Our efforts in Dot-Com continue to help us. So I think there are some industry things that are happening and some of the things that we're doing, and they're just continuing to pick up speed.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, good to hear. Just a quick follow-up. If you could just elaborate on the key product trends that you're seeing within footwear. If I heard correctly, it sounds like basketball kind of humming along status quo at a pretty strong clip. The running business, it sounds like there's a little bit of a subtle change there. I think, Dick, you mentioned the New Balance 574 style becoming more popular and the ASICS' and Mizuno's technical brands slowing. I know that this business has a history of ebbing and flowing between technical and casual, but just curious to see if this is a start of a bigger trend or what you make of it in its early days.","Richard A. Johnson","Yes, I think that the lifestyle of running is certainly an important piece of the running category. And I think you're right, that it does ebb and flow. And right now, things like the Roshe Run, things like the 574, the consumer is after those and very excited about them. At the same time, we look at things like the top-end shoes from Mizuno and Brooks and ASICS, and we see some strength there, sort of that middle tier that gets stretched one direction or the other, and that's where we're seeing that shifts in running.","Kenneth C. Hicks","The other thing I think that's happening is you're seeing just the look is changing, as there's more emphasis on -- you're seeing strengthening of some of the basic colors with pops versus some of the allover color. And as that changes and the vendors react to it, to the customer trend, we'll -- you'll see things get back in line. But overall, we're pleased with the running. And the good thing about running is that there are a number of people who are performing well.","Okay. Thank you, and thanks, everybody, for the call.

Maurer - Treasurer, Investor Relations & Vice President","Thank you, Christine. I'd like to welcome all of you to Foot Locker, Inc.'s first quarter earnings conference call. Driven by a strong comparable sales gain of 7.8%, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $184 million or $1.29 per share. This net income result is an increase of 13% compared to last year's GAAP net income of $162 million, and 12% higher than our non-GAAP result last year of $164 million. The $1.29 earnings per share figure is 17% higher than the $1.10 per share we earned in the first quarter of 2014 with a higher percentage increase in EPS compared to the increase in net income, attributable to the continued reduction of shares outstanding resulting from the execution of our share repurchase program.","The $1.29 earnings per share result also represent a 16% increase over our non-GAAP earnings of $1.11 in Q1 last year. Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will open our prepared remarks this morning with a detailed review of our first quarter financial results. Dick Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will then provide additional product and operational insight into our first quarter result and review the progress we are making on our recently updated strategic priorities.","As always, we look forward to answering your questions following our prepared remarks. Lauren?","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. 2015 has started off on a very strong foot with the first quarter results representing another record financial performance. In terms of nominal net income dollars, it was the most profitable quarter in our 100-plus years as a public company. The 7.8% comparable sales gain that John mentioned translated into a 2.6% overall sales increase, factoring in the impact of significantly weaker foreign currencies compared to a year ago.","On a constant currency basis, total sales increased 7.9% with strength in all of our regions and channels. Breaking out our comparable sales gains by segment, our stores were up 6.5% while the direct-to-customer business leather performance was an 18.5% sales increase. Within the direct-to-customer segment, Eastbay generated a low-single-digit increase, while our domestic store banner dot-com businesses collectively increased sales almost 50% for a two-year staff increase of over 90%.","Clearly, our investments in digital capabilities have been effective as have our initiatives to create a customer experience that seamlessly incorporates all the ways they engage with us: desktop, mobile, or in store. Overall, direct-to-customer sales increased to 12.3% of total sale from 11.3% a year ago. Our international divisions produced the strongest sales results within our store segment. Europe was up low-double digits overall with double-digit sales increases in all of the major countries on a constant currency basis.","Our Foot Locker Asia Pacific business, which operates in Australia and New Zealand, posted a comparable sales gain in the low teens, while Foot Locker Canada generated a gain in the high-single digits. We also had strong performance in the U.S. with the Foot Locker and Footaction banners both producing high-single digit gain.","Kids Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker generated gains in the mid-single digits, and that was the fourth consecutive positive sales result for our women's division. Champs Sports posted a low-single digit comparable sales decline, with strengthened footwear not quite enough to offset an ongoing decline in apparel sale. While Dick will touch on some of the current product challenges at Champs, it remains a highly profitable chain with significant opportunities to get back to positive sales growth.","Turning to families of business. Footwear continued to be the leader in the first quarter with the gain in the low-double digits. Apparel was close to flat overall with some pluses and minuses by division and region while sales of accessories were down high-single digits, challenged by changing trends and stocks in-house.","By category, running sales increased in the mid-teens with Foot Locker Europe posting the strongest gain. Basketball was up low-double digits overall with growth even higher outside the U.S. The casual category was mixed with gains in boots and certain classics offset by declines in various vulcanized styles. We noted on our previous call that February's comp gain was in the mid-single digits. Shift of Easter this year to the beginning of April two weeks earlier than last year benefited March sales, which were up low-double digits, while April's comp gain was back to mid-single digits.","We were able to lever these strong sales to improve gross margin by 40 basis points to 35% of sales from 34.6% a year ago. Our merchandise margin rate improved 20 basis points on a constant currency basis. FX changes cost us 20 basis points. And leverage of our relatively fixed buying and occupancy costs gave us 40 basis points of improvement. The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily the result of operating with lower markdowns in both our stores and our digital business.","While our initial market rate declined slightly again, the vendor and category mix issues we mentioned frequently in 2014 moderated substantially during the quarter. Our SG&A expense rate improved 100 basis points to 18% of sales from 19% last year. 60 basis points of the improvement was the result of expense control and sales leverage, while the other 40 basis points was related to FX, as translating operating costs denominated in weaker foreign currencies actually led to a decline in reported SG&A dollars.","The investments we have made in the training of our associates, as well as the hiring and scheduling tools we have rolled out to almost all of our divisions around the world continue to yield benefits by getting our most productive associates engaged with our customers during peak selling opportunities. This enhanced productivity as measured by across-the-board gains and sales per payroll hour is an important component of our ability to lever SG&A expenses to the record low levels we saw in the first quarter.","At $35 million, depreciation expense was down slightly from last year's $36 million, due in part to FX which reduced this year's figure by $2 million. We still expect depreciation to trend up over the course of 2015, reflecting the higher levels of capital investments we are making, and it should come in at approximately $150 million for the year.","The rest of the income statement primarily interest expense and income taxes came in very close to our expectations going into the quarter. Our inventory management continues to improve, along with our sales and profit results. At actual FX rates, inventory decreased 2.7% compared to our 2.6% sales increase.","On a constant currency basis, inventory increased 2.4% compared to our 7.9% currency neutral total sales increase. These results reflect the progress we are making on one of our least talked about long-term objectives, although it is one of my favorites, inventory turns exceeding three times. While it is an internal measure, I can say we are making consistent progress, improving inventory efficiency, pushing our turns towards this goal, especially in footwear.","We ended the quarter with $986 million of cash, a decrease of $21 million from the end of Q1 last year. We continue to execute our share repurchase program, acquiring 2.3 million shares for approximately $129 million during the first quarter. And we also paid an increased quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share.","Together, the share repurchases and dividend amounted to $164 million of cash return to our shareholders, almost 90% of our net income in the quarter. We also invested approximately $58 million of capital into our business, including opening 37 new stores and remodeling or relocating 55 stores. Many of these projects include a vendor shop-in-shop, such as the House of Hoops, Fly Zone or PUMA Lab. We closed 41 stores with the largest number of closures continuing to be at Lady Foot Locker. We ended the quarter with 3,419 company owned stores.","Touching briefly on some of our operational metrics. An increase in average unit retail was driven by the lower markdown rates I mentioned, as well as the ongoing trend of customers opting for more premium product, for example, from a less expensive vulcanized shoe to a special print Roshe or a ZX Flux shoe. While traffic and units sold were down a bit in the quarter, conversion ticked up as our product and marketing differentiation effort ensured more customers came in to our stores ready to shop and buy and our outstanding sales associates were ready equipped to serve them.","To sum up, we delivered results in line with or better than our guidance on just about every financial and operational metric, fueled by sales that exceeded plan and we were able to flow those incremental sales to the bottom line at a good rate.","Although in line with our expectations, the stronger dollar took away almost $100 million from our top line, which flowed down to a $0.05 hit to EPS in the quarter.","Overall, there were no real surprises in the quarter to create a need to adjust annual guidance we gave you back in March. To summarize that guidance again, we expect comparable sales gains to be in the mid-single digits with no significant deviations by quarter. Gross margin should be flat to up slightly, SG&A to improve 50 basis points to 60 basis points, depreciation to be approximately $150 million, and our effective tax rate to be about 36.5%. That all should lead to double-digit EPS growth for the year.","The second quarter, being a relatively low sales volume quarter, will likely be the quarter most negatively impacted by the stronger dollar. We've been planning a mid-single digit comp gain in the second quarter and we're off to a very solid start with a double-digit month-to-date comparable sales gain. That said, there are some launch shifts coming up that will likely impact that month-to-date comp rate.","Let me now turn the call over to Dick to delve into more of the product details behind our strong first quarter results, and more broadly, review how we're doing executing our updated strategic priorities. Dick?","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Lauren. And good morning. I appreciate everyone taking the time to be with us this morning. Let's start by looking at our core business, which we have defined as selling basketball, running, and casual footwear in our men's stores in the U.S. In other words, Foot Locker, Footaction and Champs Sports.","Lauren already mentioned the strong comparable sales gains at Locker and Footaction, where our merchant and marketing teams have done a great job creating clear swim lanes by differentiating the assortments in those banners. Both have taken full advantage of the strong trends in lifestyle running footwear, including platforms such as the Roshe, Huarache, and Max Air (sic) [Air Max] from Nike, and ZX Flux from adidas.","At the same time, they have also sharpened their focus on their core customer, with Foot Locker really taking advantage of the ongoing strength in signature basketball. It is very encouraging that our customers are embracing new signature athletes, such as Kyrie Irving with Nike, Steph Curry with Under Armour and Damian Lillard at adidas, all while the established players, LeBron, KD and Kobe are posting sales gains in footwear also.","The Footaction banner is on many of those trends as well. But it also has an especially strong position in other lifestyle footwear silhouettes from Jordan, Nike, Timberland and PUMA. On the apparel side, Footaction is generating nice comparable sales gains by focusing on the lifestyle assortments of the established athletic brands while also working with smaller non-traditional vendors to bring a fresh and different fashion look to our customers.","We are beginning to roll out our remodeled Footaction store design with excellent results so far, as well as additional Jordan Flight 23 and Nike Kicks Lounge shop-in-shops inside our Footaction stores.","Champs Sports has participated in many of the strong footwear trends I just mentioned, as well as the adidas Superstar business that also performed well around the globe in the first quarter. However, this banner does have a larger exposure to training and performance running styles which has limited its footwear gains.","The relative weakness at Champs continued to the apparel. Fleece bottoms sold well but it was not enough to offset the exposure to licensed apparel and losses in shorts and performance socks. The team at Champs continues to work with our vendor partners to strengthen assortments in both footwear and apparel as we cycle against some of the programs that are downtrending.","Turning to our growth pillars, our Kids business turned in another solid quarter. Lauren mentioned that the Kids Foot Locker division was up mid-single digits, although I'll mention that the other banners that sell children's footwear, our business was up double digits. While still posting a strong result, our Kids division did suffer a few times in Q1 with delivery issues related to the West Coast port delays.","Looking ahead, we believe deliveries are in good shape, and over the rest of the year, we will be accelerating the rollout of one of our very successful partnerships with Nike, the Fly Zone at Kids Foot Locker. We'll also continue to add KFL stores to our fleet, both in the U.S. and internationally.","We had an outstanding result in Europe, another of our growth pillars, with the overall business up low-double digits in the quarter. Basketball, driven by Jordan, was up double digits, while running was up in the high teens, with adi's ZX Flux and Nike modern comfort styles leading the way.","Our court business was also very strong, led by classics such as the adi Superstar and Stan Smith's. Among the many encouraging developments was a modest comparable sales gain in apparel, reversing a negative trend over the last several quarters. Gains in Nike Tee and Tech Fleece more than offset ongoing declines in other older styles and licensed apparel. We believe we have settled (19:30) through the most challenging parts of our European apparel business, and as a result, that category can again contribute to productivity gains there.","Another encouraging development is the broad-based nature of our gains in the quarter. As Lauren mentioned, all of our big countries produced double-digit comparable sales gains, including Spain and Italy, which had lagged a bit last year as their economies struggled to gain traction.","While it is possible that macroeconomic headwinds may still occur from time to time, our business in Europe has remained profitable throughout. We intend to continue building out our Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker presence in European countries with the most opportunity for store growth. At the same time, we are adjusting the models for our Runners Point and Sidestep banners to create the necessary differentiation between the Foot Locker banner and maximize our potential, both in Germany and in other markets. Just last month, we opened a newly designed and assorted Runners Point store in Cologne that has attracted great attention from the local running community. It's a model we will test in other markets as we continue to prepare that banner for future expansion.","I touched on our apparel results already, so let me turn to the next store of growth for us, our digital business, which had another outstanding quarter. Lauren noted the top-line growth of our U.S. store banners dot-com and Eastbay. The team was able to delivery healthy margins to go along with those strong sales. The primary product drivers of the excellent sales growth of the store banner dot-com sites were similar to the store business that I have described.","In its specialized assortments for the elite athlete, Eastbay also continues to perform exceptionally well, with gains in baseball, football, soccer, training including our strong position in weightlifting shoes and our team sales. Although we've had some stock \u2013 had our stock locator program in place for quite some time, the benefits are accelerating from the investments we have made in opening our inventory up across all of our channels. Our buy online, ship from store capabilities are becoming an increasingly important incremental driver of sales and margin for our business.","Turning to our European digital businesses, growth rates are high with plenty of opportunity for increased penetration relative to the store business. Margins are up significantly, due in part to a reduced emphasis on off-price selling \u2013 off-price clearance merchandise that was part of the digital business we acquired with Runners Point.","We have brought the management of the digital business in Europe under one combined team and are moving those sites to a common platform. As a result, we are able to draw on best practices not only from Foot Locker and Runners Point in Europe but also from our global center of digital excellence in Wausau, Wisconsin. Finally, we recently launched our digital business for Foot Locker Canada, and that business is off to a very encouraging start.","Turning now to our women's business, we had another solid comparable sales gain at SIX:02 Lady Foot Locker, marking four consecutive quarters of comp gains. Footwear was up mid-single digits led by many of the lifestyle running styles from Nike, adidas that drove the men's business. ASICS also remains a very important brand to this customer. Apparel, however, was the real bright spot with a low double-digit gain. Fitness pants, capris, and tops from both Nike and adi powered most of the volume. But Under Armour and Reebok are generating gains as well off smaller bases.","The vast majority of the chains still consists of Lady Foot Locker doors, and we are pleased with the progress we are making there with our updated assortments, with as much emphasis as possible on key apparel elements while still driving a healthy footwear business. Meanwhile, we now have 20 SIX:02 stores opened. We continue to elevate the assortments in our SIX:02 stores with not only the best products from the major athletic brands but also key items from brands such as Alala and Lorna Jane.","We're continuing the exciting work of building a brand, including leading with our six02.com website, which enables a national outreach while we build up our store network by market. We are also developing various community outreach and grassroots marketing efforts as we work diligently to have her discover the SIX:02 brand and spread the word about it to all of her friends. Finally, the women's business in our other banners is also doing very well with double-digit footwear gains in Foot Locker in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific.","Let me wrap up my prepared remarks by thanking the entire team at Foot Locker, Incorporated for the tremendous achievement of producing the most profitable quarter in the 100-plus years of our company. We've now produced 21 consecutive quarters of comparable sales gains and profit increases. This first quarter was the fourth consecutive all-time record of first quarter earnings and we have achieved broad-based diversified gains around the company with strong performances across regions, channels, banners and categories. It took each person in the company working together with passion, energy, skill and the true love of the game to deliver these outstanding results and I'm very proud to be a part of this high-performing team.","Thank you. I will be happy to take your questions. Go ahead, Christine.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Very good results overall. I'm actually going to nitpick a bit here then. First, average price points certainly continue to assist. What's the outlook for the go-forward period on ASP? And what can you do to overcome some of the weak overall mall traffic to boost that metric up? Second, what's the comp from the stores that have been remodeled versus the rest of the base, right? Champs' performance suggests that there may not be as much of a lift being provided given the apparel weakness, which I would also like for you to address if there's any assortment changes or any initiatives on that front that we should look forward to.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Paul. Thanks. From an ASP perspective, we continue to see the ASP moving up slightly. Some of it a shift out of lower-priced vulcanized product maybe into some of the modern comfort running styles. There continues to be high price point basketball offerings. So the ASPs and transaction values I think are going to continue to increase a little bit. And I think the customers are certainly willing to pay when they see the exciting product that our vendors are bringing to bear on the marketplace. So I think there will continue to be some growth there.","And I think the traffic comment, I think as long as we can continue to bring exciting product into our stores, our customer chooses the avenue that they're going to shop on any given day. And when you combine our digital business and our in-store business, we want to be accessible to the consumer however they choose to shop and interact with our banners on any given day. So that's going to continue to ebb and flow, and traffic is different around the globe. I think that there's been some reduced traffic in key tourist stores in the U.S. At the same time, traffic has looked solid in Europe as some of those visitors may be staying home than shopping. So I think, again, because of the diversification we've got in geography, traffic is mixed around the globe.","The comps in the remodel stores, we haven't separated out our comps from the remodels and not. I can tell you that across all banners, the comps and our remodels are outperforming the balance of chain, and the remodels are meeting all of our hurdle levels. So we're continuing that program across all of the banners, and we've got a little bit of work going on in every banner with right now the emphasis being on Footaction here in the U.S., but Foot Locker continues to remodel and add vendor shops. Footaction continues to remodel and add vendor shops. Champs continues to remodel as well, so the program is going to continue.","Then clearly, on the apparel assortment, we've seen the turn in Europe. I think when you look at Champs, probably the biggest change in the assortment and the steps that we're going to take, they're changing their mix of licensed product. They're the banner that had the most exposure to licensed and to jerseys specifically. So while there continue to have a footprint in licensed, they will not be jersey-based. It'll be a little bit different mix of product that's relevant to the local market. So, again, we're confident that the team of Champs is working hard on the apparel piece. We do believe that the remodels are helping on the apparel presentation in the Tyrone concept. So the guys are working hard and we expect it to turn.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I appreciate that color, Dick. Thank you. One quick one for Lauren. Just merchandise margins were up this quarter, which was nice to see, but with the guidance for gross margin, I believe still just flat to up slightly, my assumption is that there's no expected gains in merchant margins going forward. Why is that? And also, how should we think about the embedded assumption for occupancy leverage on the mid-single digit comp?","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So the dynamics that we have in the balance of the year, similar to what we had in the first quarter where we've got some headwinds because of weaker foreign currency that shows up with challenge to the gross margin. As we saw on the first quarter with a 7%, 8% comp, those kinds of comps helps the leverage, so that's part of the offset there. We weren't successful on the first quarter in lowering our markdown rate. So that's what led to the 20 basis points improvement that we saw in merchandise margin. So those are the dynamics and, as we look to the rest of the quarter, we've got this FX thing to write out.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thank you and congrats.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Maybe, Lauren, the first question I have just as it relates to the earnings guidance for the year. I think you said you have no real reason at this point to update the prior range, and I think part of that is double-digit growth, obviously, it's fairly open-ended. So maybe in the context of the results you've just posted for the first quarter, I guess, has your degree of confidence in the outlook changed at all, or is the level of double-digit growth that you're expecting any different from the prior level of double-digit growth, or could you give any more perspective on that?","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm not going to refine double-digit but, no, we're not modifying the guidance, so still looking for mid-single digit. First quarter came in high on that spectrum of mid-single comp. But, no, that translate with the flow-throughs that we're describing to double-digit EPS after we factor in the FX currency, which again cost us a nickel in the first quarter. And as we stated the guidance on FX for full year, that's going to continue to be an element.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And I know you called out specifically the second quarter up mid-single digits for the EPS, which is consistent with what you said a few months ago. Is that the only quarter you expect to be kind of below that double-digit rate, or how should we think about the reasons for calling out the second quarter specifically?","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's got the biggest gap from where the currencies are today to where they were a year ago and relatively lower sales below the (33:18) top line. So that dynamic puts more pressure on the EPS growth in 2Q.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just one last one. Just to clarify for the second quarter, you mentioned the comps off to a very strong start and also called out some shifts coming up during the balance of the quarter. Could you maybe just provide a little bit more color on what those shifts are and kind of how you expect the quarter to play out maybe from a high level.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've been pretty clear. I mean, the launch shifts change month to month, sometimes quarter to quarter. Not all launches are created equally and launch is just a portion of the business. We've got some sales tax holiday shifts that happen at the end of this quarter, so the guidance to mid-single digit comp gains just as sort of the \u2013 we're only less than two weeks into Q2. So the fact that we've had a great start to Q2, we expect to have a strong Q2, but it will moderate a bit from where we are today.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thanks for all the color.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Anderson from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about just what's working at Lady Foot Locker. And also, we noticed in the stores you're starting to take out some of the ladies' product in the Foot Locker segment (34:58). Are you maybe focusing more on the Lady Foot Locker brand? Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, we've had both footwear and apparel have a strong quarter at Lady Foot Locker and SIX:02, and obviously with only 20 SIX:02 doors open, the strength of the gains right now are coming from Lady Foot Locker. The assortment changes a bit in the other banners, but there's been no decrease of women's footwear in any of our other banners. They all have a strong position in women's depending on the mall that they're in and the adjacencies that they've got.","So we've seen good casual running styles selling at Lady Foot Locker and SIX:02. We've seen some performance models that have been successful. We've seen really strong pushes in some of the apparel things that we're testing and bringing in. Probably the driver right now is that we are bringing I think a better apparel assortment into the Lady Foot Locker stores, especially where we have enough room in those stores to show it appropriate.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. And so should we think about the Foot Locker brand starting to focus more on men's and then sell kids, and then the ladies' brands more at Lady Foot Locker and SIX:02?","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that all of our banners except Footaction have women's footwear and will continue to have women's footwear assortments going forward. The girl or the female that walks into a Foot Locker is a little bit different than the female that we're targeting with SIX:02. We've got 1,100 Foot Locker stores in the U.S. We've got something less than 200 Lady Foot Locker stores, so there's a lot of malls where there's not a Lady Foot Locker store, and we still expect to be able to service a female customer. So they're creating, as we said earlier, clear swim lanes so that the female that shops in each of those stores has a different offering. But they will all live in harmony as we continue to service various female customers in the mall.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. That's helpful. Congrats on the quarter, and good luck next quarter.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Susan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Nice job. I guess, first question, just a point of clarification regarding the second quarter in the comp, you're off to a very strong start. It seems like there's \u2013 you've got a good launch coming this weekend and towards the tail end of the month, there's also a good launch. Is it just the viewpoint that as you get towards the tail end of the quarter, some of those tax-free holidays shift into August and that's where you would comment that that comp is unsustainable, because it doesn't seem like there's big, meaningful shifts in the product launch that would cause that. I'm just curious, some clarification around that.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We had good, strong launches last year. So, I mean, we're up against good, strong launches in those weekends as well. And there are shifts that happen. It can be quantities, can be week-to-week. And you called out the sales tax shift. I mean, that impacts some of our stores here in the U.S., so again, the first 12 days, 13 days of the quarter have been...","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Have run the full quarter mix (38:31).","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Exactly \u2013 have been strong, and we feel good about it and we're happy to have the running rate that we have right now. But I also know how our guys have looked at the quarter in great detail and that's where we see it moderating a bit.","Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Fair enough. I mean, it's still a tremendous start, so that's great to hear. So I'm just curious, switching to Europe for a second and just \u2013 it's nice to see the progress on apparel finally. I'm just curious about, number one, the sustainability there and, number two, kind of how that plays into your viewpoint on the margin profile whether EBIT or product margin profile and the opportunity there in Europe as well as you move forward.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, I think that clearly having a positive gain in apparel for the quarter was a positive for the Europe team, and they've bounced along trying to make changes to the assortment; they've gotten there. They're still \u2013 we talked about it in the prepared remarks, they've got some older silhouettes and some older programs that they have to work through but we expect the newer stuff and the direction that they've taken the assortment to continue to improve, which should in fact help us on the margin line.","So I think that they've done a nice job re-assorting the stores. They've got things going in the right direction but the old stuff that wasn't successful doesn't go away, right? I mean, you've got to make it go away and it takes some markdowns to do that. So they've done a really good job and they're just going to be coming in to their summer sale period. A lot of the countries in Europe have regulated sale period. So they'll use some markdowns to move through some of the old stuff but, as we get to the back half of the year and they've gotten through some of the older programs, I expect the apparel margins to improve in Europe.","Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay.","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All the productivity measures and initiatives that we have apply to Europe just as they do in the U.S. So the things that we're doing on allocation, the things that we're doing to help make our associates ever more productive, all of those coupled with strength in apparel will help margins both in Europe and the U.S.","Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you. And then just finally, just on the inventory, I know crossing \u2013 being the three turns \u2013 in terms of what we see is nice. I know, Lauren, you have a much higher or different metric you look at. Where are we in relation to that metric at this point? And I guess the inventory allocation which really kicks in next year plays an important role to getting that where you want it to be. Just sort of curious as to where you are internally on that number. Halfway there, whatever?","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're continuing to make progress. We haven't crossed the three mark yet, but we are making progress on that. And you can read it as you look at what our total inventory growth is relative to the sales growth. And as long as we're continuing to manage that below the sales growth, we're making progress on the turn. It's coming in footwear. We're making significant progress. And as these apparel initiatives gain traction, well, that gives us fuel to help further that.","The allocation tool that we've invested in is in the process of rollout, of coming online. We're adding more product to it as we progress through this year. But as you call out, it gets more powerful for influencing that turn as we get into next year and start benefiting from its learning and are at the point next year and into the following year where it helps us place our orders for better flow and allocation. So, yeah, it's a multiyear play. But we'll keep you posted on how we're doing on that. It is improving.","Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. I'm sure you will. Thank you and all the best. Thanks.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Dick, I want to ask you about your online business, a really strong growth this past quarter and at the same time, you mentioned, I think, traffic in the stores was negative. Do you see a direct relationship between traffic in stores and traffic online? Is there an inverse relationship where when one is down, the other is up more? If you could just talk about that a little bit, that'd be really helpful.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I don't think there's a direct correlation, Jay. I mean I think that \u2013 again, our focus is making sure that we engage with the customer however they choose to on any given day. And traffic is influenced by a lot of factors. We don't talk about weather often but when the weather's crappy, sometimes people don't go out. And again, the traffic phenomena is different around the globe for us. I mean we've got some areas in Western Europe where our traffic is up nicely. Again, is that related to maybe the Europeans not taking U.S. vacations this year? I think if you read a lot of the press and tourist markets, they will tell you that the traffic is down right now in a lot of different ways.","So, I think, our focus is truly engaging with the customer however they choose to engage with us any given day. So we certainly want to drive them to the stores but we also want them to look at us online. If they get excited by the latest Foot Locker approved commercial that they see on YouTube and they hang out watching that stuff with Foot Locker in mind all day long, that's a win for us.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Interesting. And then if I can ask you about SIX:02 at the same time, can you give us an update from what you talked about at the Investor Day? You have 20 stores open right now. You're elevating (44:42) the assortment, how close do you feel like you are to really accelerating the growth of the concept and feeling like you got it exactly where you wanted to be?","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm not sure that we'll ever feel like we got it exactly where we want it to be, right? I mean that's the way retail works that there's always improvements and things that we can do better. But our thoughts haven't really changed from Investor Day, Jay. I mean I think the target that we talked about is something over 30 stores by the end of this year and then we'll be in a position to examine the ramp-up as we look at 2016 and 2017. And we're very bullish on the business.","I think that our team that's focused on SIX:02 is doing a great job, finding the right sweet spot on the apparel mix, working to get the right footwear silhouettes in, testing some new brands. It's part of the evolution, and I think that we talked about the excitement of building a brand from scratch. We haven't done that for a while around here. So there's a lot of energy that goes into it and making sure that she finds the store, figuring out traffic drivers and grassroots marketing things that we can do to connect in the markets where we're clustering our stores, along with growing our online banner, the six02.com business. So, again, I think we're in the same place from a thought process as we were at our Investor Day, Jay, but again that place is very bullish on the SIX:02 business.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks so much.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Great quarter. Just from a bottom-line perspective, I don't want to get ahead of you guys too early here. But larger picture, any structural hurdles that would prevent the model from reaching mid-teens EBIT margins over time?","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I mean we talked about that at Investor Day, too, Matt. I think that structurally there is nothing that will inhibit that, but it's a long climb. And we know how much effort and how much work it takes with our vendors and our team here to add a tick or two to that EBIT margin along the way. So we see steady improvement and that's our goal and objective is to keep driving that number up.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then just to clarify more near term, is mid-single digit EPS growth, is that still the forecast for the second quarter? And if so, is that based on mid-single digit same-store sales?","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The guidance was mid-single digit comps. I mean, with not significant variation by quarter and double-digit EPS for the full year. The second quarter, again, most challenged on a EPS double digit in the second quarter because of the \u2013 where the currencies are today versus where they were a year ago.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. I think it was three months ago, you guys laid out mid-single digits for the second quarter and I think that's why \u2013 I think that's some of the clarification people are looking for.","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just to make sure I didn't...","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We did not say that, mid-single digit on EPS for second quarter. We said it's the most challenging quarter.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Best of luck.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My question was focused on Runners Point and the Sidestep business, and you had mentioned during the call you had made some changes there in order to better define the banners. Can you walk us through what some of those changes are and what the rollout strategy is?","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Kate, thanks for the question on Runners Point because we're making good progress there. I think we've talked about it at our Investor Day, but the Runners Point stores are truly going to be everything running, right? I mean from casual lifestyle running to performance running to race day running. And we've added a bit of women's, a bit more women's so as you walk into a Runners Point store now, one wall is men's, one wall is women's.","We're adding some training into the mix as well, so we'll be about running and training. They've got the apparel assortments. We opened a little bit bigger store in Cologne with some design elements that we're testing to see if they work, if the consumer responds to it. And again, the initial \u2013 it's been open about three weeks now I think and the initial response from the local running community, which is a big part of going to Runners Point stores has been very positive.","We're going through the same exercise in Europe, segmenting product, looking at the different consumer muses and creating the right assortments so that Foot Locker, Runners Point and Sidestep all have clear room to work. And the Foot Locker banner's very clearly established. The Runners Point banner we've now put in place. With that being said, that also means that we fired some customers at Runners Point, right? There's no more canvass product in Runners Point. No more boots, no more vulcanized product.","And so that's the type of product that the consumer will find at Sidestep. So we're now going through the work process with Sidestep to define their muse clearly and get their assortment right. So we're learning with the store in Cologne, a little bit bigger format, almost becomes a key lighthouse store in a market. And then we'll surround it with more traditional sized Runners Point stores to strengthen the feel in any community.","We're also developing the model to reach out into that running community and make sure that we've got the strong connection. So, again, you know that we're pretty pragmatic. We think about a prototype. We build that prototype whether it's physical or the community building piece of it. We test it. We tweak it, and then we develop our rollout strategy. And that same process is going on with Runners Point and Sidestep.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then my last question is just on the innovation pipeline, particularly for running for the rest of the year. Just wondering if you could walk us through what the dynamics are with the innovation pipeline prior to an Olympic year. Do you see things kind of slow down a little bit in terms of what's being turned out and then you see a surge around the Olympics in terms of a new platform or new idea for the following year?","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, historically, that's been the pattern, Kate, I mean, that new things that will drive an Olympic year start to show up later in the year before. But innovation comes in a lot of forms for our consumer, right. A very cool Roshe becomes exciting and an innovative thing on the kid's foot. The ZX Flux shoe that we've got from adi that's got very cool patterns and connected to apparel and headwear. Those things, our kids sees as innovation. I mean talk about new technology, absolutely the Olympic year will fuel some exciting things. But all of the vendors are bringing exciting product to market. And the innovation is helpful, and we all look forward to that. But right now, our kids are finding the product mix pretty exciting.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter and a tough quarter for the retailers.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","I wanted to see if we could just think about your comp guidance for a little bit here. Lauren, maybe you could help me out, the mid-single digit comp gains that you guys pointed to. But you did mention that I think units were down in the first quarter and implied that traffic at brick and mortar were down, which is not anything different than we're seeing at the mall. But can you talk about how you guys built up your guidance for mid-single digits in each quarter? And I'm guessing you expect some price increases or a mix shift towards premium to continue in the second half. That's been going on in a while, particularly in basketball, so maybe a good time to reflect on what you expect as far as building up to that mid-single digits in the back half.","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Really \u2013 I mean the expectation is that the trends that we've been seeing, we don't see any reason for those to change. So, yes, AUR has been increasing. AUR has been a story now for quite some time. Several factors have been contributing to that. We've been less promotional and the customer, as we've described, has been opting towards this innovative, more premium product, which is of course our specialty. So that's part of it, also coupled with our remodel program and the exciting vendor shop-in-shops that we've been adding that have delivered these increases. So as we thought about mid-single, we've thought about what we were doing on the CapEx and how those remodeled stores were performing.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Dick, you mentioned...","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But I'm also \u2013 I'm going to go back to the tape because I have done that on the Q2 guidance. I absolutely did tell you in March that Q2 being the most pressured on a mid-single, we were thinking about that being mid-single digit EPS because of the FX. So it's \u2013 I would tell you that we saw a nickel of pressure in the first quarter. We planned the year thinking that the euro would be about $1.10, $1.11 before I walked in this morning. The pressure on Q2, think about as being about a nickel.","John A. Maurer - Treasurer, Investor Relations & Vice President","Right. A nickel is bigger on Q2's volume than it is on Q1 as a percentage basis.","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Sorry. Again, we said full year EPS impact if the euro stayed at about $1.10, it was $0.16 to $0.18 for the full year. So does that help?","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Well, I think that was someone else's question but it is interesting. So are you trying to tell us that the \u2013 I'm trying to figure out if you're telling us that the guidance for mid-single digit earnings growth in the second quarter that you commented on in March, is that still where you're guiding the second quarter or not?","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'd said if the euro stayed about where it is today, it's about a nickel's worth of pressure. So is there a possibility for it to be double digits? We're very focused on productivity and flow-through, so to the extent that we'd beat sales plan, yeah, that can happen.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just back to some of the thoughts on the comp for the year, Dick, you mentioned that you have confidence in the team working on the Champs business and that they're working on the merchandise assortment to get it back to positive territory. What did you guys count on in the rest of the year, in particular in the back half, for Champs? Do you think you'll have it back in positive territory by then?","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm confident in the team and I believe that it will in fact get there. We've got some older things still to cycle through and that license exposure that I talked about in some of the sock business. The brands and the team are working close together. So I'm somewhat optimistic that they can get it positive by the end of the year.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot. Congrats again on a great quarter.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","John D. Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just moving away from discussion on Q2, looks like Kids Foot Locker led in both remodels and openings. Can you just talk about trends there both by category and by vendor? And then just on running, it sounded like running got better. I think you said up mid-teens. Can you talk about what in running drove that? Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","We talked about KFL in the prepared remarks, and while the actual comp was a little bit tougher in KFL based on some West Coast port issues, we're very bullish on the business and it's bounced back nicely in Q2 now. So we have continued to open doors. We're remodeling some doors and adding the Kids Fly Zone with Nike \u2013 a shop-in-shop with Nike in some of our KFL stores. And that's been very successful, so we continue to see that happening.","There's a lot of similarities between Foot Locker and KFL from product that's working, it's takedown of marquee and performance, signature athlete basketball shoes, some of the same silhouettes on the running side, whether it be ZX Flux or Max 90s or whatever it happens to be that's driving the adult side. So a lot of similarities there on the footwear side, and the team is working hard on the apparel side in KFL as well.","So, on the running front, it's driven right now more by the lifestyle running than it is necessarily performance running but when you talk about ZX Flux and you talk about the Huarache and the Roshe, the Max Air (sic) [Air Max] product from Nike, those are all really important silhouettes and really important platforms for our businesses around the globe right now. So we've got the ability to sort of see what's going well in Europe, and then we can see if that works here in the U.S. So I think the diversity of our geographies helps us to identify those hotter silhouettes.","John D. Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","So would you say premium running is getting better relative to some of the trends in the back half of last year?","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Premium running, yes. Technical running, not necessarily.","John D. Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that we're seeing some nice play in some of the more expensive premium sort of running silhouettes. They're not always truly technical performance-based. But again, most of the shoes that are built to run in aren't actually used to run in, so I think that the customer's finding comfort \u2013 and some of that I think has got to do with (01:00:04) the apparel pant of choice was the cut bottom pant, which looks better with a running silhouette. I think that some of that's going on as well.","John D. Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. Good luck.","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks. Nice job, guys. Lauren, my question was on the IMU. You mentioned that vendor and category helped on the initial market, but I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail around that and if that's a trend that should accelerate as the year progresses.","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That was a little bit broken up, but I think your question was around what we're seeing with the IMU. And I had commented that the vendor and category mix that we talked about a lot (01:01:00) negatively impacting, moderated in the first quarter. So did I get your question right about what you're wanting to get more insight into?","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes. IMU pressure (01:01:17) a little bit, and how that looked for the rest of the year. Should (01:01:21- 01:01:25)","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sorry, you're breaking up. But yeah, the questions are I think around IMU and what we're seeing. So the moderated, the pressure on IMU (01:01:33) is still down a bit from a year ago IMU. And again, it's being driven not just in the cost of the product to us but (01:01:45) of categories and vendors. It moderated in the degree of (01:01:52) than the year before in the first quarter. So would expect that that would be the case, and that helps the merchandise margins, at least at this point from it. We're further helped by the finished (01:02:07) margins by the fact that we are less promotional and working on initiatives to further reduce the markdown.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks very much.","John A. Maurer - Treasurer, Investor Relations & Vice President","Christine, I think we have time for one more question.","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","John A. Maurer - Treasurer, Investor Relations & Vice President","Thank you. And, Christine, I think we have time for one last one (01:02:25).","Operator","Yes. Thank you. And our final question comes from Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Brandt Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, everyone. The call did seem like it starts to break up. So hopefully you can hear me. But congrats in this great execution from the team. Most have been asked, but let me just \u2013 if I could get a little bit of color as to the planned remodels for the balance of the year by banner. Is there \u2013 have you guys ever broken that out or could we get some color on that?","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","No, Eric. We have not broken out the (01:03:04) by banner. Other than to say by the end of 2017, we expect about 10 of the Champs Stores and about 50% of the Foot Locker Stores to be done by the end of 2017.","Eric Brandt Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Any way to see if that's...","Lauren B. Peters - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And (01:03:20) also described here \u2013 I think we've also described to you that the actions, new remodels came on just recently so it's in the early days, but we're working through the banner as well. Applying some of what we've done in Foot Locker U.S. with the Willowbrook design internationally, so we've got some updates going (01:03:45) as well.","Eric Brandt Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then just if I could on capital allocation, again, I understand just kind of consistent dividend buyback. Is there any kind of thoughts potentially for another Runners Point type of thing given the international play, sort of exploiting maybe some of the dislocation in the European markets to pick up something that's attractive or is it really stay the course in terms of capital allocation?","Richard A. Johnson - President & Chief Executive Officer","We talked about it at our Investor Day. I mean there's no other acquisitions built into the plan that we've put out for 2020. We have a lot of open to list and open to consider, so it's not contemplated in our plan. But who knows?","Eric Brandt Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Fair enough. Okay, guys.

This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views of future events and financial performance.","These forward-looking statements are based on many assumptions and factors, including the effects of currency fluctuations, customer preferences, economic and market conditions worldwide and other risk and uncertainties described in the company's press release and SEC filings. We refer you to Foot Locker, Inc.'s most recently filed Form 10-K or Form 10-Q for a complete description of these factors.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John A. Maurer","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We're happy that you could join us this morning to discuss Foot Locker, Inc.'s results for the third quarter of 2012. Earlier this morning, we reported that Foot Locker had record earnings of $106 million or $0.69 per share, a 60% increase over the $0.43 per share that we earned in Q3 last year. As noted in the release, these GAAP results benefited from a $9 million tax adjustment. Without this benefit, which added $0.06 to the results, non-GAAP earnings were $0.63 per share, an increase of 47% over last year. This very strong profit result, another record for our company, brings year-to-date earnings on a GAAP basis to $293 million or $1.90 per share, a 50% increase over the same 39-week period last year.","I'm joined this morning by our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Lauren Peters, who will begin with a summary of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. She will also update our outlook for the rest of the year. Ken Hicks, Foot Locker, Inc.'s Chairman and CEO, will then review our progress on several of the key initiatives that the management team outlined in our long-range plan earlier this year. Ken and Lauren will hit the highlights for all of our banners and all regions of our global operations, and we'll leave time for your questions afterwards.","I'll turn it over to you now, Lauren.","Lauren B. Peters","Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. We truly appreciate your interest in Foot Locker. After reporting comp sales gains for the first 2 quarters that were very strong but which fell just shy of 10%, we were very pleased to report this morning that we not only sustained top line momentum in the third quarter, we are able to call out a double-digit quarterly comp store sales gain. Our 10.2% comp store sales gain in Q3 brings our year-to-date gain to a very strong 9.9%.","We continue to execute well in terms of translating those top line gains into record bottom line results. The non-GAAP earnings of $0.63 per share that John mentioned was the highest level of Q3 earnings in our history as an athletic company. Our year-to-date EBIT margin flow-through, in other words, the increase in year-to-date EBIT divided by the year-to-date increase in sales, is almost 40%, indicative of solid expense management even as we invest in programs to drive traffic and increase productivity and as we tapped many exciting new ideas for our stores and Internet sites.","To focus on the top line first. Our domestic stores collectively comped up in the low-double digits in the quarter. The only division with a comp store loss was Lady Foot Locker, which Ken will touch on during his remarks. The best performer was once again Kids Foot Locker, with a gain topping 20%. Champs Sports, domestic Foot Locker and Footaction all had double-digit comp gains for the quarter. The gain at Champs was especially impressive coming on top of a similar double-digit gain last year for a 2-year stacked gain of approximately 30%.","Foot Locker Europe finished with an essentially flat comp for the period. As we noted on our last call, Foot Locker Europe started the quarter on a positive note in August and sustained that low-single digit gain performance through much of September. However, after the customer had kept their appointment with us during the important back-to-school selling period, October softened somewhat, giving us a flat comp sales performance for the quarter. Ken will also touch on our European initiatives a bit later in the call. Our other international divisions performed well, with Foot Locker Canada posting a high-single digit gain, and Foot Locker Asia\/Pacific coming in with a mid-single digit increase.","Sales in our Direct-to-Customer businesses were up 18.3% overall, with our athletic banner Dot-Coms up almost 50% in the aggregate. Included in the overall gain was a high-single digit comp decline at CCS.com, which continues to redefine its place in the very promotional skate category. Excluding CCS, the 2-year stacked comp results of our digital business continued to exceed 40%.","Our comp performance was very consistent across footwear, apparel and accessories, each within a percent or 2 of the overall 10.2% comp. Within footwear, the kids' category was strongest, posting a gain in the high teens across all of our divisions. Women's footwear was up slightly as gains across most divisions more than offset the decline at Lady Foot Locker.","Within men's footwear, the basketball category continues to show great momentum, with a gain of more than 20%. Our customers were drawn to the key player shoes, such as LeBron, Kobe and Rose. The Jordan Brand, including Jordan Classics, is exceptionally strong with all of the Retro shoes selling through very well. Basketball is also becoming increasingly relevant in Europe, where the growth comes not from our key player shoes but in Jordan and a variety of classic basketball silhouettes such as the Blazer and Adi Hardcourt.","Running was slightly positive overall, with gains in our U.S. stores and online sites, partially offset by weakness in Europe, where some customers are migrating out of running and training styles into the court styles I just mentioned. The Nike Free is clearly the running shoe of choice for many of our customers. But technical running shoes from the likes of ASICS and Mizuno are doing well, as are other Nike running models such as the Flex and Dual Fusion.","As I mentioned, apparel was up low-double digits, with a solid gain in the teens in the U.S., slightly offset by a small comp decline in European apparel sales. Branded apparel continues to outperform private label. And the back-to-school uniforms certainly seem to include at least one verbiage T-shirt very likely produced by our Team Edition facility.","Within accessories, our gain was led by high-performance socks from Nike, Adidas and Jordan. Hats were also doing really well, as our customers are literally looking for us to provide them with a complete head-to-toe hookup. By month, we posted low-double digit comps in the key back-to-school months of August and September and a high-single digit comp gain in October. If you look at it on a 2-year stacked basis, our comp pattern was steady throughout the quarter in the high teens.","Our gross margin rate rose to a solid 33.1% in the third quarter, an increase of 60 basis points compared to last year. The margin story is similar to last quarter in that the gain was a combination of occupancy leverage, from which we picked up 100 basis points, partially offset by a 30-basis point reduction in merchandise margin and another 10-basis point decline due to lower shipping revenue from our Direct-to-Customers sales.","In our U.S. stores and online sites, we were successful in offsetting the reduced initial markup percentages from our vendors, which we have described on previous calls, by lowering our markdown rate. As a result, our merchandise margins outside of Europe held steady year-over-year. The 30-basis point decline in merchandise margin primarily stemmed from Europe, where we continue to take additional markdowns in order to keep our inventory position current and on trend. That said, our European business remains productive and profitable, and we believe we are taking share in several markets. In fact, our profits in Europe during the quarter were higher than a year ago, even after backing out the $7 million adjustment we took last year related to European vacation accrual.","Mentioning that adjustment from last year brings me to SG&A, which improved by 210 basis points in the third quarter to a rate of 20.9% compared to 23% last year. Even excluding the European adjustment of a year ago, SG&A still improved by a very strong 160 basis points. SG&A leverage starts with maximizing the productivity store wage expense. But we continue to invest in tools and technology to drive improvement. First, we've installed a program to help us manage our payroll hours and make sure the right associates are on the sales floor at the right time. Second, we have rolled out a tool to improve the efficiency of the associate hiring process. And third, we continue to expand traffic counters to more doors, which allows us to measure conversion and implement programs to propel sales per payroll hour even higher.","Looking at our year-to-date SG&A performance. We have produced a sales gain of $348 million, with an SG&A expense increase of only $12 million. We achieved this tremendous leverage, while making incremental investments in powerful marketing programs, a great example of which is the Foot Locker Approved campaign that we launched this summer, which clearly helped drive increased traffic and sales in our stores during back-to-school. Our depreciation expense was $30 million for the period, up $3 million from last year, reflecting the increased level of capital investments we're making in the business. Meanwhile, interest expense was flat at $1 million.","Our GAAP tax rate for the third quarter came in at 31.7% due to the settlement of a foreign tax audit, which allowed us to reduce tax reserves established in prior periods. Releasing those reserves reduced our tax expense by $9 million or $0.06 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding that benefit, our effective tax rate was 37.5%, in line with our expectations. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation reflecting this tax adjustment was included in this morning's press release.","The bottom line net income total of $106 million in Q3 is the highest level of earnings of any third quarter in our history as an athletic company and more than 60% higher, $40 million higher to be precise, than last year. On a year-to-date basis, our GAAP earnings in 2012 are up almost 50%, $96 million higher than a year ago, which was our previous best-ever year.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our inventory increased 3% compared to last year. Given a total sales increase of more than 9%, it is clear that our turns are improving and our inventory is fresh. We feel well positioned in all of our markets for the holiday selling season. Our cash position continued to strengthen as we ended the quarter with $853 million of cash and short-term investments. We spent approximately $30 million in the quarter to repurchase 841,000 shares. We've already repurchased almost 3 million shares this year under our $400 million share repurchase program at a cost of about $94 million.","We are also on track to spend approximately $170 million in capital this year, as we continue to invest in high-return potential projects to drive future business performance. In a few minutes, Ken will talk about some of the initiatives we are testing that can justify additional capital dollars in the coming years. We're still developing our 2013 capital program. But for right now, suffice it to say, as we did on the last call, that the potential exists to significantly increase our capital spending over the next few years.","On the real estate front, we have closed 72 stores and opened 70 year-to-date, bringing our store count to 3,367 at the end of October. Many of the new stores are in Europe, which helped propel our profits there that I noted earlier. We have a handful of new stores still to open this year and as mentioned on the call in August, we are on track to close slightly more than 100 stores for the full year as we continue to aggressively tackle the least-productive stores in our fleet in order to improve our financial returns and overall productivity.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, let me turn to the rest of the year. First, as everyone knows, the quarter got off to a challenging start with some truly severe weather events. But despite that, our comp sales through yesterday are actually up mid-single digits. But let me pause here, Ken, since I know you'd like to comment on Sandy.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. Thanks, Lauren. First of all, I want to express my deepest sympathies to everyone who suffered losses and hardships due to Hurricane Sandy. Fortunately, all of our associates are safe, but many did experience significant, even devastating damage to homes and property and some remain dislocated. Through our charitable entity, the Foot Locker Foundation, we have created a fund to support our associates most directly impacted by the storm. And we've made donations to the American Red Cross, and our operating divisions have also donated shoes to local charities.","I was extremely impressed by the dedication of so many of our associates who, as soon as the storm passed, went to extraordinary lengths to get to their stores, distribution centers or offices to keep the business running, if not quite at top speed, then as close to it as possible. I want to thank all of them. It was a tremendous effort.","Lauren B. Peters","Indeed, it was extraordinary. At the peak, we had about 200 stores closed for several days, but we got all but a handful of the stores open very quickly. Given the size of our global footprint, we do not expect the storm to have a material impact on our fourth quarter results. And as I said, month-to-date, comps are up mid-single digits with most of the sales trends I mentioned for the third quarter still in place. Specifically, Europe's comps are running down somewhat and Lady Foot Locker is also negative. The rest of the key banners have good positive momentum.","We are planning comps for the fourth quarter to be up toward the upper end of mid-single digits. Please remember that the fourth quarter this year contains an extra 14th week. This extra week takes us into the beginning of February, one of our biggest months of the year. This shift does not in itself impact comps. However, our current forecast is that the week could add about $0.10 per share to our reported earnings.","Gross margin is expected to be up 50-or-so basis points on a comparable 13-week basis, in line with recent quarters. The same margin dynamics, namely lower IMU, offset by lower markdowns with pressure from the mix between U.S. and international sales are expected to continue in the fourth quarter. The extra week, which contains no occupancy expense, will, of course, provide significant incremental leverage to the overall margin rate that we report. Similarly, we intend to continue to leverage our SG&A expense on a comparable 13-week basis, and the extra week will lower the rate about 40 basis points even further.","Our tax rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be more in line with our new normal run rate of between 37% and 38%. The greater contribution of earnings coming from the U.S., where the tax rate is higher than our average international tax rate is pushing the blended rate up from the trend of the last few years, which was around 37%.","Finally, currency movements created profit headwinds of about $0.01 per share in the third quarter. This equals the impact we saw in the second quarter and brings the year-to-date impact of exchange rate changes on our reported earnings to a minus $0.03.","Having given you all of the financial details, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken, so he can paint the bigger picture, as well as address several of the key initiatives we have underway.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks, Lauren, and good morning. I'd like to add my thanks to everyone for your participation on today's call. Let me first spend a few minutes developing some of the themes that Lauren touched on. For example, she noted the potential for an expanded capital expenditure program in the next couple of years.","As you've heard us say, we're actively developing and testing new prototype stores for virtually all of our banners. The banner that is furthest along in that process is Champs Sports. And so far, the results of that banner's test stores have been quite good. We want to see how they perform during the holiday season before making a final rollout decision. But we're optimistic an accelerated remodel program for that banner will produce significant returns for the business.","Moving to Foot Locker in the U.S. That banner has a couple of prototype stores in operation, one in Smith Haven Mall on Long Island and the other at Willowbrook Mall in New Jersey. We are still in the early days for those stores, and we're learning from them. The initial reads are definitely encouraging, and we plan to put in place several more test stores this quarter and more in the first quarter.","We've also been testing Kids Foot Locker stores. We've put in place pop-up Kids stores in malls with strong children's business within the regular Foot Locker to test whether the malls can support both banners profitably. The results have been encouraging. We're also testing a new design of Kids Foot Locker and trying out Kids Foot Locker stores in Europe, where we think the banner will translate well.","Turning to our women's business. This is still a work in progress. As Lauren mentioned, Lady Foot Locker posted negative comps for the quarter. Although disappointing, it wasn't a huge surprise because we're really moving that business to reach a different customer. And I've certainly been around long enough to know the old retail clich\u00e9 that when you fire a customer, they know right away. But when you hire them, it can take a while for the new customer to find you.","We are really repositioning Lady Foot Locker to cater to that active woman in her 20s and 30s with a premium assortment of stylish, great-fitting, high-performance athletic apparel, shoes and accessories. The 14 rescanned Lady Foot Lockers feature all the premium athletic brands, such as Nike, ASICS, Adidas, Under Armour, New Balance and Reebok, that fit the active woman's on-the-go lifestyle. The new banner that we just announced, SIX:02, is targeting that same customer, taking a strong position on fitness and performance that is even more pronounced than the rescanned Lady Foot Lockers. We will support the broad product assortment in SIX:02 with well-trained, highly knowledgeable store associates and an exciting new store environment.","The 3 SIX:02 stores are almost 4,000 square feet, larger than our average Lady Foot Locker. These test stores will be open for Black Friday. One is in the Stamford Town Center in Connecticut, one is in the Willowbrook Mall in New Jersey and the other is in North Star Mall in San Antonio, Texas. It is far too early to tell whether the repositioning moves we're making in the women's business will produce the returns necessary to justify a major rollout. But we know we had to make the move because the productivity of the Lady Foot Locker business over the last several years has not compared favorably to our male banners.","It will take some time for the customer to find us and see the compelling product stories we believe we have for her in both Lady Foot Locker and SIX:02. However, every day, we're learning more about how to deliver the shopping experience and merchandise assortment that she wants. And we have a talented, highly motivated and dedicated team here that keeps making strategic adjustments to the formula. And I'm confident we're headed in the right direction.","Let me turn now to Europe. As Lauren mentioned, we posted a flat comp there. Under the challenging economic circumstances faced by most of our customers there, we aren't disappointed at that result. At the same time, we continue to implement initiatives to strengthen the business even more. For example, with traffic in Europe relatively weak, we are heightening the focus of our store associates on customer conversion.","Another example is our push to take advantage of the recent fashion trend shift in Europe towards basketball. As a category, basketball is still not nearly as important in Europe as it is in the U.S. And as Lauren mentioned, the gains are somewhat concentrated in certain classic styles such as the Nike Blazer and the Adi Space Diver. Performance players' shoes are not yet as large a factor in Europe as they are in the U.S., although the Jordan Brand is growing nicely in several key European markets. In any case, we know a little about basketball business here at Foot Locker, so we're excited about the shift.","The European prototype store concept that we introduced last year, the Locker Room, is still being tweaked, with the U.K. stores not yet producing the returns required to justify a major rollout. However, we remain cautiously optimistic that the banner will find more success once we open some stores on the continent, where the promotional environment is not quite so intense. Overall, the Foot Locker team in Europe is doing a good job navigating through the macro environment, keeping inventory fresh and relevant and maintaining a highly profitable business.","I don't want to forget to mention the very strong performance of our Direct-to-Customer business. The consistently high top line growth we're seeing there, accompanied as it is by strong profitability, is a reflection of the terrific team we have in Wausau that drives the Footlocker.com and Eastbay business. We continue to invest in our sites both in terms of providing entertaining, engaging content featuring authentic lead athletes and in terms of developing and optimizing the sites for all sorts of devices, from smartphones to tablets to old-fashioned PCs, like John sometimes still uses. We certainly see the digital business as having the potential to deliver the highest top line growth over the next several years, and we intend to invest in the business to maximize its potential.","Lauren mentioned the big picture. And while it is tempting to look back on our 11 consecutive quarters of meaningful sales and profit growth, a record of which we are certainly very proud, around here, we're always looking forward. We remain confident in the near-term prospects for our business. However, the economic picture in the U.S. is far from rosy -- or of particular concern to me is the likely payroll tax increase slated to kick in at the beginning of the year. Anything that takes money out of the pockets of our customers creates a more challenging business environment.","I certainly expect that our political leaders won't lead us over the fiscal cliff, but we'll have to manage through whatever economic circumstances we find ourselves in. We've produced solid results for the last few years in less-than-ideal economic times, and we are fortunate that our key vendors, Nike, Adidas, Converse, Jordan, ASICS, New Balance, Mizuno, Reebok and Under Armour, continue to develop innovative product and great ideas as fast as ever. Our customers remain excited by the stories we're telling and the product assortments they find in our stores and on our digital sites.","Before we get to your questions, I do want to pause again, and on behalf of the executive committee, personally thank the entire team at Foot Locker, who delivered another stellar quarter and who, as I said, went to extraordinary lengths to keep our business moving forward after taking Sandy's best shot. Fortunately, the much bigger selling period in the quarter is ahead of us. Our plans are in place. And now it's time for us to execute and bring home another record year, not just for our shareholders but for our customers and our associates as well.","Thank you. We'll be happy to open to questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to start off, can you just give a little bit more color, Ken, on what you've seen initially through the Lady Foot Locker remodels? And if you can just give a little bit more color on SIX:02 and how it will differentiate from the remodeled Lady Foot Locker stores?","Kenneth C. Hicks","The Lady Foot Locker stores, much more apparel presentation and apparel-driven, more performance-oriented, not as much on the classics and fashion shoes. And we've got 14 of them up, and they are performing better than the overall chain. But we're still learning, and we've got to make sure we keep them in stock on the apparel, that we've got the right presentation of the performance, that we tell the customers what's there and the staff. So while they're performing better than the chain, some are performing much better and some are performing just at the chain. So we're looking for more consistency as we have in our other remodels. With regard to SIX:02, SIX:02 is really taking that and putting it on steroids. It's a much stronger performance environment, very apparel-driven, be more than 50% apparel in terms of presentation. And it'll be a much friendlier environment. It's a bigger store, so we'll have more space to tell stories and communicate to that customer the full assortment of what we have.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And it was good to hear that merchandise margins were held flat in the U.S. But if you can just give us some color on expectations going forward, and especially talk about Europe. Will we start to see some relief there from a merchandise margin standpoint now that inventories are clean?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. Well, as we said, the expectation is that the dynamics we saw in the third quarter will continue into certainly, the fourth quarter, and we'll see about next year as we get closer. But that dynamic is that we have lower IMU that we are managing to offset at least domestically with lower markdowns. But in Europe, we have wanted to keep the inventory fresh and have had to take some additional markdowns to do that. So we would hope that begins to mitigate. And certainly, as we see some strength in basketball, which is the beginnings for us, maybe that will help us there. But the dynamic of shipping revenue, that -- I don't see that abating. The customer loves free shipping.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And just lastly, could you speak about the trends in footwear versus apparel margins this quarter?","Lauren B. Peters","Well, I can tell you that we narrowed the gap, but we are still not declaring victory with apparel margins ahead of footwear margins.","Kenneth C. Hicks","It's about as close as you can get, but I want to see it for a while before we say we're there.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Ken, I would love to hear a little bit more of your view on the -- your personal view on the macro consumer environment. Heading into the holiday, heading into 2013, there's such a lot of reasons you're talking, whether it's natural disasters or the fiscal cliff, you have some tax changes, Europe crisis, which is ongoing. You guys don't seem to be really missing a step. And I wonder if you're seeing your consumer show an underlying strength that may be kind of overcoming all these things going on out there. I wonder if you've got any personal views on that, or you're seeing variations across regions, across consumer demographic.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we are not exempt from the rest of the world, although the customer appears to be willing to spend the discretionary money they have on our products. And part of that is we've got -- it's something that they love and makes them feel good. And part of that is there's a lot of new and exciting things out there. We do see, particularly in Europe, the more challenged countries are more challenging. Greece and Spain are more challenging. Germany, France happen to be stronger countries because their economic environment is strong. If I knew how it would play out, I probably wouldn't be on this call. But I'm assuming that we will work through this, we have through the years, and that -- or I should say the governments and the economies will work through this. There will be some pain, and we will suffer some of that. But I'm also assuming that because of actions we've taken and how we plan and work and the product that we have that we will fare better than others.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Fair to say, I mean, as you talk about kind of increasing the capital commitments over the next 2 years, which is pretty exciting. And I don't know if it's clear, whether it's more centered around remodels versus square footage growth. But you have to have a certain level of confidence or comfort with kind of the ongoing economic environment, given your willingness to really kind of ratchet up the capital spend.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. And as you look at our capital and the investment, there are really 4 major things that we're focusing on. One is digital, which we look at as an opportunity for sales growth and to drive traffic. Another is that shopping experience, to make us more productive, to drive higher sales, which is one of the reasons, quite frankly, we've closed more stores. And we will continue to close unproductive stores. Improving our overall productivity to improve our profitability, with systems like what we've done with our time management system but also warehouse management system and a better allocation system, and in Europe, where we can increase share and position ourselves for the future. Because as you look at the business, you got the near-term, intermediate-term and longer-term. And near-term, we feel good about where we are with the product, the promotions we have and the customer reaction to that. We feel very good about that. Intermediate-term, we are making sure that we set ourselves up with the renewals that we're doing, the remodels, the product mix, growth in our children's business and apparel and making sure that we have a strong position there. And longer-term with by looking at what we're doing in digital, by making sure that we're positioned properly in Europe when it comes back, by being a player in team sports, and with the new formats that we're testing and looking at. So that we are positioned strongly in the near-term, we make sure that we're going to keep that going in the intermediate, and we will be an important player in the longer-term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess, Ken, clearly on everyone's mind, beyond just the macro uncertainty, is, I guess, the state of this \"athletic footwear\" cycle. Maybe you can just speak to again the visibility that you all have in terms of the product pipeline, not only through holiday but into spring next year, kind of what gives you confidence from a vendor perspective of what's out there, be it in basketball or running, that again sort of helps sustain this momentum that we've seen in the last couple of years.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Sure, Eric. There's 2 things. So one is we keep talking about the cycle. And there's 2 things going on. One area is an athletic footwear trend, and it's actually an athletic trend. More people are wearing sneakers now than a year ago. Next year, more people will be wearing them, and that benefits us. There's also because of what's happening with health and wellness, more people are being more active. So the athletic apparel will also become more important. So there's that trend. There is definitely right now a cycle of elements that accentuate that trend, things like color, technology, fashion, just what people are doing, the fact that the elite athletes are all doing well. Those accentuate that trend. And what we see is that it will -- there's a lot of great product ahead of us. We see great new launches. We see terrific -- based upon the key athletes, we haven't taken the full benefit of some of those. Obviously, you've got people like Jordan and LeBron. Now that he's really reached that elite level, he's going to become more important. Kobe continues to be an important factor. But you've got the push of people like Rose and Kevin Durant that are going to add to the elite athlete. You also have the importance of color, and what we're seeing in color. And so you have all of the key players, and then players like ASICS and Mizuno that are really driving color. You have new players like Under Armour coming out with great new shoes, like the Spine. And they're pushing very hard, and they're pushing hard in apparel. Reebok is working very hard to make sure that they are -- continue to maintain their relevance. Adidas is going to be a stronger player, not just in basketball and the classics but in running. So all of those things, we can see out into the -- from the near to the intermediate future look good.","Lauren B. Peters","And the customer responds to that newness.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. They like the newness, they like the look. And so from what we see, and that's why I say the near-term, the intermediate-term, those are things that we have some visibility to, we feel good about. And we continue to position ourselves for the longer-term.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. I appreciate that. And then just as it relates to the apparel business, I understand that, that continues to improve from a profitability perspective. But maybe just stepping back, where you feel like the assortment merchandising is -- again, I hate to use the phrase sort of what inning we're in. But how you feel like reassorting that mix focused more on branded, focused more on performance product as you look across the fleet?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, I would say we're in the fourth chukker. They play 6 chukkers in polo. And we have built a much stronger position with branded, but there's still things that we know we can build and expand upon both in terms of the fashion elements and the performance elements. Where we have had the biggest challenge because we had a big private label business that was commodity, and as we back off on that and go into some performance elements, like our women's Actra business, that takes some time to build up. And so you've got the negative, but you don't have the full positive yet. And as we learn and develop new elements within each of the banners and they feel comfortable, as Footaction, we make sure we have the fashion elements of that. In terms of Champs, we just went through -- going through the shift in the NFL from Reebok to Nike. That will take time to continue to grow and develop. But that's going to be a tremendous plus for both of our companies. So there's things going on. We're nowhere near this being played out, but we've made a lot of progress. And we've seen it both in terms of sales, it's been up in the 20% range every quarter, and in terms of the improved profitability performance.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of follow-up questions. The first is on kids', just the amazing momentum there. Maybe a little more comment on is that all style takedowns, adult takedowns driving that? And how sustainable is that unbelievable comp trend and why? And then the second question would just be on running. Maybe a little more on what you see there. Could there be things in that pipeline you're speaking of that could get your running business to reaccelerate again? And maybe weave into that the Flyknit and the Nike+? I think some analysts have put some big numbers out there on how big the Flyknit could be and I haven't heard anybody saying much about that.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay, sure. On kids', I do think it's sustainable. There's not a lot of places now for better kids' shoes. And we are the place to go to get better kids' shoes because you've got kids and other people with kids. All they want to wear is sneakers, which is great because they'll grow up just wanting to wear sneakers, too. So we are positioned well there with our chains. But it is the growth of takedowns and shoes that look -- that are more adult-like, both things -- the elite athlete shoes, LeBrons and Kobes and Jordans. But also things like the Free are good shoes. And so we're seeing that. We're also seeing a resurgence in kids' of the classics. The All Star or the Samoas are doing a great job in kids' because they're just looking for a good shoe that, that the child can wear that's got some color, has a good look to it. And so it's a mix of both new and exciting takedowns and the classics. But it's more, I think, that people are just paying attention to it, both the vendor, the retailer and the parents. With regard to running, I think running is going to continue to improve. And as that improves, we will continue to do better because we're not as penetrated, but we're getting a lot better at it. Now there are some exciting new things, the Flyknit, the reason I don't think anybody has talked much about it is there are not a lot of them out there. But as the quantity grows and we're getting more in our stores, and we'll have many more in our stores next spring, we think that, that's going to be a big shoe. It's a terrific shoe and a great idea. We're improving our performance in some of the classics in terms of running, making sure like the Pegasus, that we have a stronger position with that, as well as the Lightweights. We're building our position with people like ASICS and Mizuno. They are doing a terrific job with their product and as well as Brooks, and we're building our position there. And then there are new people getting into the business in a stronger way, like Under Armour and Adi. And I think you put that together, the specialist, Nike, strengthening their position significantly, and some new players. And I'm very optimistic and bullish on running.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just last question, Ken. The Nike+ shoe, how did that launch go versus your expectations? And is that expected to do well this holiday? And what do you see in that for next year?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I think the Nike+ is -- it did fine. But it's going to take a while for the customer to fully understand all the features and benefits. I see the Nike+ kind of like the Free. It took the Free about 4 or 5 years to become an overnight success. And same thing is going to happen there, that people -- I'm wearing a Nike+ band right now, keeping track of my fuel points. More people are going to care about that and look to track their mileage to compete against themselves or others. And that's what the Nike+ and the miCoach both do.","Operator","And our next question comes from Stephen Glagola from Barclays Capital.","Stephen Glagola - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one question on the pricing side of it. Heading into holiday and as you look to spring here, where are we in terms of seeing some of the price increases from some of your vendors work their way through the supply chain?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I would say we've had some and we continue to have some. They've moderated significantly. So they're working their way through. And as cost go up or cost go down, we're seeing the adjustments on pricing. But we're working with the vendors to make sure it doesn't impact the sales.","Stephen Glagola - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess, just looking at Black Friday here coming up, any initiatives that we should look out for in the stores?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We have a tremendous, tremendous lineup -- it's actually the whole week. And we have a press release coming out about noon, and I don't want to preempt that. But it will be some exciting things all during the week with launches from Jordan and Nike and Adidas. And we've got Rose and Foamposites and Jordan Retros and new LeBrons. So it's a big, big week.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sam Poser from Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Number one, in Europe, are you benefiting from -- like what happened in the U.S., when the economy got really bad, and you saw a lot of little guys close. Are you picking up extra business because just basically the power that you have, the size of your business, the financial setup and everything?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. We are picking up share. We are seeing some of the small guys close. We entered, for example, Czechoslovakia, we bought half a dozen stores -- or I said Czech, that shows you how old I am, the Czech Republic. And so there, we're seeing the benefit, if you will, of the tough times.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then you sort of said -- I've like 2 more questions. You said it in general, but the e-commerce by banner, you commented how the banners were up 50%. Can you give us a little more detail there? And then lastly, can you talk about how many stores you plan to open in the fourth quarter? You talked about the closings for the full year, and then how you're thinking about stores opening or closing for 2013.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, the e-commerce by banner, actually, they're pretty consistent. Our largest one is Footlocker.com. But the growth is pretty consistent, if you will, that it's significant. With regard to -- and I'll let Lauren talk about the specifics for this quarter. But next year, we have not finalized the plans. But our focus is going to be on opening the right number of stores, still looking at Europe is where we're the most underdeveloped. But really, closing and openings is going to be focused on productivity, what's going to give us the biggest sales and profit growth.","Lauren B. Peters","And for the fourth quarter, openings about 10 to a dozen. Closures, we've got about 25 still to go.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So Ken, you've got a lot of growth drivers out there. And we can hear the confidence from you on some of these things, like the new Champs shops, the new Champs reimages. Other things like the reimages at Lady Foot Locker, CCS or the Locker Room sound like they haven't turned the corner yet. Can you just talk a little bit about how you look at those initiatives and how you make decisions on a go-forward basis as to whether to keep pushing ahead versus pulling up anchor?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we look at the performance and the numbers, and then see if they're headed in the right direction or wrong direction, and then do the economic analysis. This is why we prototype, test, and then roll out or we don't roll out. I think the Lady Foot Locker -- we're seeing the benefit of the Lady Foot Locker. It's just we want to see more, so we're going to continue to tweak and develop that. Locker Room, it's an unusual situation. You've got to put it up against -- we opened it the way we did because of the Olympics. But now we've got to get a better test and check the Europe because, believe it or not, the U.K. is not all of Europe or indicative of all of Europe. And then CCS is something that we continue to evaluate. We had some good success in the first half. We continue to make adjustments. And it's been -- the challenge we have there is the industry's having a tougher time. The whole skate-surf business is having a tough time. But we will evaluate that and make the call at the appropriate time.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just ask on gross margins. How should we think about gross margins looking ahead a little bit, maybe beyond just the near-term here and in 2013? And do you think 2013 is a merchandise margin-positive year? Obviously, the brands have taken some price increases on you and maybe you haven't taken as much but -- or maybe you're just on a different schedule. But do you think 2013 becomes a positive merchandise margin year?","Lauren B. Peters","Thank you, Mike, for asking that because I didn't really answer that one. Paul asked the question about the margins. We still remain optimistic about merchandise margins from the things that remain in our control, like the allocation system that we're investing in. We did a test with that this year, and we're pleased with the test results, so we're going to go forward with that system investment here in 2013. And certainly, as we allocate the products better, the first time around, you get more full-priced selling, which will support better merchandise margins. So we still think that there's opportunity on merchandise margins. The tree may -- the fruit may be higher up in the tree, but it's still there to harvest.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. If I could sneak in one last question. Ken, your comment about technology as a footwear cycle driver earlier was interesting. If you look at the data, there's been some strong trends in the lower-priced running SKUs, and that's probably helped by the popularity of Free. And maybe some customers are -- that are just fashion customers are buying basketball or buying running last year. But I mean, couldn't you make the case that the pressure you're seeing at maybe some of the high end of running could be indicative of a slowing of the cycle if you're not able -- if the brands aren't able to push the customer towards the high price points there as they roll out new technologies again?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I don't think so based upon what we're seeing with what's happening with Mizuno, Brooks and ASICS. So I think that -- and we have underplayed the technical running from Nike and things like the Pegasus. And so there's an opportunity for us to step up there. So there is a customer who's just in it for looks, but there's also the technical customer. And so the good news is we offer both because we've got Free and we've got Dual Fusion, we've got Lunar. So we're able to give the customer what they want.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Zolidis from The Buckingham.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Question on the plans to significantly increase potentially capital expenditures next year. Could you just let us know when you're evaluating the deployment of capital, what criteria you're looking for in terms of the return? And then how would you compare that return to share repurchase, for example? If you can buy back your stock at less than 6x EBITDA, you would get a nice return for your shareholders; how you contrast that with the investment that you're considering in the business?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. Okay. So all of our projects that we invest in, be it new stores, remodels, et cetera, we hold to hurdle rates of 13% IRR and 11% ROIC. As we look to the results of these initiatives that we're testing, and we're looking for returns, at least that -- or should be actually quite a bit more.","Kenneth C. Hicks","But we just conducted a review with the board of the projects of the last couple of years, and they were -- they are significantly more.","Lauren B. Peters","So we ran a number of different scenarios that consider these tests playing out a different way and that will drive different levels of capital investment and different timing. We need to get through the holiday selling season to see how those tests perform. And then we will evaluate where we head with which of those capital scenarios with our board in January. So when we come back at first quarter, we'll be able to give you much more insight into that.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. That's very helpful. Just one follow-up. So after you go through this process on the store remodels, the new formats, et cetera, then the free cash flow that you might still expect to generate, would that be more likely to be applied to additional share repurchase?","Lauren B. Peters","Well, we certainly have room still to go on the program that's been authorized, right? We've got a $400 million share repurchase program. We only spent $94 million of it so far. So if returning money to our shareholders both in share repurchase and dividend remains a priority, our first priority is investing in the business to get after our long-term objective.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So I just -- I have a question regarding comps to date. I mean, as tragic as the events were, I guess, mid-single digit is very commendable in terms of the performance. But is it fair to say that if you look at areas outside what was affected or maybe post the events, sort of what's been going on, is it fair to say that the comp performance is stronger than that? Or can you add any color in and around that, if you exclude those areas in markets that were impacted, just sort of what we're thinking about there?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, it's safe to say that the areas that didn't have stores closed for a period of time did better than those that did. But yes, I mean, areas outside are better. One of the things though to keep in mind, we have demonstrated that during the real key selling periods, we perform stronger, the February, back-to-school, holiday because we've become more of a place people want to go. It's not that we don't perform well during the other times, we just perform better. I think for the holidays, we will perform better. So I feel optimistic, I'm not concerned about being up -- not that being up mid-single digits is bad, but I think that, that's an indicator that the business is still strong even with all of the noise around the election, the fiscal cliff, the storm, Europe. I'm looking at reports that are coming out, most people would feel pretty good if they had mid-single digits.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, very fair. True. Switching gears, Lauren, for you for 1 second. When you look at -- can you just walk though again the SG&A and gross margin thought process for the fourth quarter? I caught most of it. But can you just walk through that one more time for me?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. So again, this is what we're planning, upper and mid-single digits on comps, 50 basis points on gross margin. And then the leverage that we get on SG&A in the fourth quarter would be consistent with what we saw last year, probably a little bit better than that. Fourth quarter SG&A has a challenge in that the malls are open longer hours and we've got to staff to that, even though not many people like to get up and shop at 2 in the morning. That does put a little bit of a damper on the leverage on SG&A in the fourth quarter.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. But you mentioned something about 40 basis points SG&A.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. So that's really when you start to look at the effect of that extra week, which will give us a lift in gross margin because there is no occupancy associated with that week, and you get the benefit. And we think it's worth another 40 basis points in SG&A from fixed [ph] within that. But just think about the 53rd week as about $0.10 from where we are.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then lastly, just on the labor scheduling and the systems there, just, I guess, you're very early in that process. Just kind of anything that you've learned from it, anything where you see the bigger opportunities from that? If you can maybe walk through your thoughts there, it'd be helpful.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. Well, it is early days for us in that it went in towards the end of the second quarter. But it really gives us the ability to see how individuals perform by hour of the day and match that up with the traffic patterns so that we've got the staffing right. So we're learning from that and making improvements in the scheduling process. And remember, you've got to train 3,367 store managers on how to get the best out of it.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. It not only does it allow us to make sure that we're staffed with the people -- the proper number of people at the right time, it also makes sure that you have your best people at the right time. So it ensures that you have productivity, better productivity. So it's not only an expense saver, it's a sales benefit, too.","Operator","And our next question comes from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So Ken, my question relates to the price increases that -- really the understory you guys have been benefiting from this year, pretty significant tailwinds to comp growth this year. However, those increases are expected to decelerate. Can you just talk about what leverage you have at your disposal to make up for that deceleration?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we are still, even with the higher prices, our units are up and our traffic is up. Mall traffic, I think, depending on who you hear because I quit counting, is flat to down a bit. Our traffic is actually up. Our units are up and our AUR is up. So we've got all of those levers working. And as one -- as price mitigates to some degree, we think that, that will help us with continued unit growth. As we improve in apparel, that will help us with unit growth. So you look at things like apparel, you look at things like accessories, socks and hats that Lauren talked about, and the development of our kids', women's business. And we think that we've got a lot of different levers, or continued increase in growth in running. So I feel pretty good about that. And sales are a function of traffic times conversion, times UPTs, times average price. And we are working with the product to drive the traffic. We've got a number of programs there to drive conversion. We are working with better product, so they hook up. So not just, okay, $5 for 20 T-shirts, it's making sure buy a $16 pair of socks or a $35 hat to go with those. And AUR is just a part of that.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","That's a great explanation. I just wanted to have one clarification. What would you say is the biggest opportunity amongst the elements that you mentioned, units, traffic, conversion? Is conversion the biggest one, given the systems that you're implementing?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, I think conversion, and that's something that I will tell you our stores organization is working very, very hard on. And the challenge is -- and it's why we put traffic counters in. 1\/10 or 2\/10 may not seem like a lot, but it's a huge, huge volume increase. And so we are working hard, and it's everybody working. It's the people in the stores. It's making sure we have the right product. It's making sure that we're in stock in the right sizes. Everybody plays a role in increasing conversion, and we've really built that up.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Great. And then just my last question is with apparel. I think this was touched upon in previous questions, but I wanted to hone in on where do you think the ultimate opportunity is on a margin perspective.","Lauren B. Peters","Well, we continue to say that when you really get apparel right, it should be a couple hundred basis points higher than footwear. That's the long-term view.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And the path to getting there, I guess, what can help accelerate that trajectory?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, one of the big things is getting the right apparel. I think we're better at that. Second part is developing a more robust private label business. We are working on that to go with the strong branded business. And the third is better allocation of product. And we're working right now to develop and put in place a better allocation system so that you have the right product in the right store at the right time at the right size at the right price. And we are working on all 3 of those things, and they will all help the apparel business. It's been growing rapidly. It's been improving the profitability. It's just the shoe business keeps doing well, too.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bernard Sosnick from Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Ken, you've spoken in the past about coordinating colors of footwear with apparel and hats, and you're alluding to that. Are you saying that this is a visible trend?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Oh, yes. When we have a launch, we'll make a T-shirt that will go with it and it'll be sold out. Or we have a -- in fact, we've got right now in Footaction, there's a Adidas jog suit that's in kind of OD, and there's a series of shoes, 3 or 4 different shoes that go with it, Forrester and Samoas and the All Stars. And they will sell out. People are buying the whole outfit. I was in a store not too long ago, and actually a guy was buying one from himself and a woman was buying one for her husband, and they were matching up everything. So that happens, but what happens more is the kid comes in, buys a pair of Rose socks or Nike Elite Socks, really, we've got 36 colors, or buys -- again, walking down the street, a kid's walking by, he's got on a Colorado Rockies hat in the middle of New York City. I asked him. I said, \"What team is that hat for?\" And he says, \"I don't know, but it matches my shoes.\"","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","The other question I have is you're very explicit about your enthusiasm regarding the intermediate-term outlook for the product coming onto the market. Does that intermediate-term outlook that you expressed include back-to-school next year?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We haven't seen all of that product yet. In fact, some of our guys are just now working with the vendors. So I can't speak to that. But I will tell you that the competitive nature of our vendors is such that I believe they're going to continue to make sure that they have the best product there.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","I agree with you on that. Let me ask you one other thing. Are you seeing anything out there that suggests that brown shoes might be picking up?","Kenneth C. Hicks","No. I'm not sure the brown shoe business is a business that, at least in the United States, I would want to be in. Europe, a little bit different situation in some of the countries. But in the States, all you have to do is look out on the street and see what people are wearing. And it's moved from -- it's not just kids now. There are a lot of adults that are wearing sneakers beyond those that work at Foot Locker.","Kenneth C. Hicks","The team has done a great job, and really appreciate all they've done. And I want to thank everybody for participation on the call and staying a little bit late, but we wanted to get everybody's questions.","John A. Maurer","And that's all we have time for right now. But we look forward to having you join us on the next call, which will cover the fourth quarter and our full year results. And that call is tentatively scheduled for the morning of March 8. For now, happy Thanksgiving, and goodbye."],"9380":["Foot Locker Inc.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John Maurer","Thank you, Richard. Welcome everyone and good morning. Thank you all for joining us today to discuss Foot Locker Inc.\u2019s third quarter results. In this morning\u2019s press release, we reported net income of $120 million in the third quarter, a 15% increase over the $104 million that the company earned in the third quarter of 2013. On a per-share basis, we earned $0.82 this year on a GAAP basis compared to $0.70 a year ago, an increase of 17%. Year-to-date, our net income totals $374 million or $2.55 per share on a GAAP basis, an increase of 25% over earnings per share in the comparable nine month period last year. As noted in our release, we incurred approximately $1 million of Runners Point Group integration costs. Excluding this expense, third quarter non-GAAP EPS was a penny higher at $0.83, a 22% increase over the $0.68 a share we earned on a non-GAAP basis last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release, and except as noted otherwise, the numbers mentioned during our remarks this morning will be based on the non-GAAP results.","As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware, we had an important development at the beginning of the month with Ken Hicks announcing his retirement as Chief Executive Officer, effective December 1, and Dick Johnson\u2019s election by our board of directors as his replacement. Ken will remain Executive Chairman of the board until our annual meeting in May of 2015. Ken and Dick will touch on that transition during their remarks, but first Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide a detailed review of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Lauren will be followed by Dick, who will provide color on the key trends in the business and the most important drivers of our recent operational performance. Ken will close our prepared remarks with an assessment of our progress on the strategic initiatives that have us well along the path to achieving many of our current long-term objectives. As always, we look forward to answering your questions after our prepared comments.","First up, Ms. Peters.","Lauren Peters","Thank you John, and good morning to you all. We appreciate your interest in Foot Locker and our ongoing development as a high performance company. Our success in the quarter started with excellent top line growth with our comparable sales increasing 6.9%. The momentum was driven by our continued sharp focus on improving the productivity of our three primary assets - our inventory, our real estate, and most importantly our talented team of associates in whom we continue to invest in order to give them every opportunity to win with our customers.","The productivity gains led to a higher gross margin rate at 33.2% of sales this year compared to 33.1% a year ago, and a 20.4% of sales SG&A rate this year, 60 basis points better than last year\u2019s third quarter. Looking at our sales gains in detail, our comparable sales gain was driven by footwear, which was up low double digits, while apparel was down mid-single digits. Within footwear, men\u2019s sales were up high single digits, women\u2019s was up strong mid-single digits, and children\u2019s was once again up double digits. Not only was our quarterly comp gain in line with our year-to-date trend, our sales increases by segment were also similar to the second quarter with athletic store sales up 5.8% this quarter versus 6.1 in Q2, while sales in our direct-to-customer segment increased 15.5% versus 14.9% last quarter.","Within the direct segment, Eastbay was up mid single digits in the quarter, a somewhat stronger performance than Q2, while our U.S. store banner dot-com sales continued to increase at close to a 40% pace. Although store banner dot-com sales remain our fastest growing business, we have yet to reach our goal of having them represent in aggregate at least 10% of brick and mortar sales.","Turning to our store segment, the differentiation of our store banners in both customer experience and product assortment has been a fundamental driver of our success over recent years, and with that differentiation comes naturally a certain diversity of short-term results, given the varying strength of fashion trends within each banner. With that said, I am pleased to be able to report that all of our banners posted comparable sales gains in the third quarter. We were led this quarter by Foot Action, which produced a low double-digit gain, followed closely by Foot Locker in the U.S. and Kids Foot Locker, both with high single digit gains. Lady Foot Locker achieved another strong mid-single digit gain, the second such quarter in a row. You heard us talk about green shoots and green fuzz - well, the grass in our women\u2019s business continues to grow in nicely. Unlike our men\u2019s division, the strength in Lady Foot Locker was led by apparel which was up in the teens, while footwear was up mid-singles.","Our Foot Locker Europe and Foot Locker Asia-Pacific divisions both achieved mid-single digit comparable sales gains. In Europe, the Foot Locker banner comps positively in almost all countries while Runners Point Group was also up in the quarter overall, although their comp result was only part of our consolidated comparable sales number for the month of October. Finally, Champs Sports and Foot Locker Canada both had small gains. Champs Sports in particular was affected by a relatively large number of stores being closed for remodeling late in the quarter.","In terms of cadence through the quarter, we posted a high single-digit comp gain in August, a low double-digit gain in September, and we managed to end up just on the right side of positive in October. Let me put that cadence in perspective for you. First, we had a very strong back-to-school season in August and September. To use an old retail clich\u00e9, we succeeded in the quarter by taking our best shot when the ducks were flying. October is by far the smallest month of the quarter; accordingly, significant timing shifts can have a disproportionate effect on comps in October, and we did in fact have a couple of key product shifts, one a Jordan retro, the other the delayed LeBron 12. The Jordan and the bulk of the LeBron 12 moved out of October into Q4, and the fact that we had a positive comp in October despite these shifts is a testament to the strength of our base business. Finally, that shifted Jordan retro did launch successfully this past Saturday, leading our month-to-date comp gain for November to currently stand at low double-digits. ","Just as you can\u2019t look at October alone, you also have to put our current month-to-date results in the proper context. These two and a half weeks are low volume relative to the big holiday selling season coming up. If you look at our comp results for October and November to date combined, it is basically running mid-single digits, and our month-to-date performance is considered in our plans for a mid-single digit comparable sales gain for Q4. ","Turning to the rest of the income statement, I mentioned earlier the 10 basis point improvement in our gross margin rate. This was achieved primarily by leveraging our fixed costs as we continue to push to improve sales per square foot and reduce occupancy expense as a percent of sales. This leverage was partially offset by a lower merchandise margin rate which included a negative 20 basis point impact related to the liquidation of CCS merchandise. Meanwhile, the trends of lower initial mark-up rates and lower shipping income continued in the third quarter. We did also manage to significantly lower our markdown rates while maintaining the freshness of our inventory. All these pluses and minuses added up to produce the overall 10 basis point improvement in gross margin. ","Our expense management teams had another excellent performance in the third quarter to produce the 60 basis point decrease in our SG&A rate to 20.4%. The payback from the investment in various training programs and technology tools can be seen in improvement in sales per hour in every one of our divisions. We did also manage to keep our marketing expense in line with last year in the quarter despite the shift from Q2 that Q3 that we mentioned during last quarter\u2019s call. ","Depreciation expense actually decreased to $34 million, $1 million below last year. The decline this quarter was primarily a function of a true-up of capital accruals. Going forward, we still expect depreciation to increase year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing investments we are making in our store fleet, our digital businesses, and various system technologies. Overall, these investments are expected to drive productivity improvements in both the near term and over the next several years.","At the very beginning of the year, we set a plan of $220 million in capital expenditures for 2014. We\u2019re currently tracking towards $210 million as economies of scale in purchasing and improved designs have produced savings in some of our store capex programs, and the timing of technology projects has been refined. ","Our Q3 tax rate was 35.8%, higher than last year\u2019s 35% rate. Both periods benefited from one-time tax audit settlements that allowed us to release tax reserves, causing our tax rate to come in lower than our normal 36.5%. ","Putting it all together, we were able to flow through 25% of our $109 million sales gain to the bottom line, producing another record for quarterly profits, $121 million on a non-GAAP basis. Contributing to our strong results is the improving productivity of our inventory. We posted an inventory increase of less than 1% compared to a total sales gain of 6.7%, leading to a solid increase in our inventory turn rate. A stronger U.S. dollar reduced reported inventory in the quarter somewhat, but even using constant currencies, our inventory increased less than 3%, still well within our standard of having inventory increase no more than half the rate of sales increases.","We ended the quarter with $916 million of cash on the balance sheet, the result of another quarter of strong operating cash flow. We continue to invest in the business and return cash to our shareholders through our dividends and share repurchase programs. ","During the quarter, the pending announcement of Ken\u2019s retirement did prevent us from executing any open market repurchases in the quarter. The $38 million we spent to repurchase 683,000 shares in the third quarter was all done under programs set up before the quarter began. We are not currently aware of any constraints to open market repurchases during the fourth quarter.","Year-to-date, we have repurchased more than 3.5 million shares, spending $174 million in the process, and we have returned an additional $96 million through our dividend program, meaning we have returned almost three-quarters of our year-to-date net income to shareholders. ","Turning to real estate, we ended the third quarter with 3,474 company-operated stores, an increase of 14 from the end of the second quarter and one more than we started the year with. We currently expect to reduce our store count by about 25 stores by the end of the year. On the other hand, gross square footage is projected to increase more than 2% from the beginning of the year. The stores we are opening tend to be larger than the stores we are closing, and we frequently add a House of Hoops or other vendor shop-in-shop concept to remodeled stores. These shops require additional space, but they also direct traffic and improve the overall productivity of the stores.","Speaking of traffic, it was down less than 1% in the quarter, and some of that decline was due to a large number of remodel projects towards the end of the quarter. Average selling prices continued to rise while units were off somewhat, primarily due to a decline in our apparel penetration. ","Before I turn the call over to Dick to cover the merchandise highlights, let me make a couple of quick guidance comments. In August, we told you we expected 20 to 40 basis points of gross margin leverage in the second half of the year with the third quarter pressured by the liquidation of CCS inventory. We\u2019re still right on track there. In terms of SG&A due to our strong third quarter comp gain and our success in reducing certain variable expenses, in Q3 we exceeded the 30 to 50 basis point improvement we expected over the back half, but some of those expenses shifted to Q4. We are in good shape to deliver our back half leverage guidance. Finally, the stronger dollar is a bit of an earnings headwind. It has not been a significant factor through the first three quarters; however, FX could lower our EPS in the fourth quarter by one or two cents at current exchange rates. Unlike recent quarters, our total sales percentage increase in Q4 is expected to be lower than our comparable sales gain because of the currency headwind. As a reminder, total sales are calculated using actual exchange rates, whereas our comps are calculated on a constant currency basis.","Overall, we are on track to achieve the top and bottom line guidance we gave you for the back half of 2014, a mid-single digit comparable sales increase and a double-digit gain in EPS. ","Let me now turn the call over to Dick.","Dick Johnson","Thanks Lauren, and good morning everyone. Let me start by thanking the entire team at Foot Locker Incorporated for working so diligently to produce another record result for our business. I know from experience how difficult the game retail is, and to put together the long string of successful quarters that the team has accomplished is a testament to the skill, hard work, leadership and dedication of every player on the team. I couldn\u2019t be prouder or more humbled to have been elected the leader of this outstanding group beginning next month.","Lauren mentioned some remarkably consistent financial results between this quarter and last, and much the same can be said of our merchandise trends. I can sum it all up by saying we continue to have excellent results around the globe with lifestyle running product and boots, while the Jordan brand and marquee basketball footwear also continue to drive solid sales gains, especially in the U.S. Meanwhile, apparel remains a challenge, especially in Europe and at Champs Sports. ","Let me dive a little deeper into those themes for you. First, the lifestyle running category remains firmly on trend. In men\u2019s, total running footwear was up in the teens with a high single-digit gain in the U.S. and a gain well into the double digits internationally. The Roshe Run, Huarache, and Max Air programs from Nike are performing very well, as is the ZX Flux from Adidas. In performance running, some of the more technical brands are facing challenges, although Brooks in our women\u2019s business is a notable exception with solid sell-throughs. We are also seeing initial success with certain smaller programs from New Balance and Puma. We are tailoring the offerings of those and all our brands to create strong running assortments that reflect the diversity of our segmented customer bases in each of our unique banners.","Turning to our other big growth category, basketball footwear was also up double digits. As I\u2019ve said before, Jordan product remains very strong in all its components. Jordan marquee was strong, Jordan sportswear was outstanding, and retros were up in the quarter despite the shift that Lauren mentioned of a significant launch into November. Within signature basketball from Nike, the big three players - Kobe, KD and LeBron - continued to produce healthy gains, and we\u2019re seeing the beginning of what we expect could be a significant Kyrie Irving business in the future. At the same time, D Rose product [indiscernible] seems to be at a positive inflection point as he is working his way back onto the court, and Under Armour has gotten into the game with their successful Clutch Fit shoe, worn by Steph Curry. Finally, we produced a great start to the boot season by making significant early investments in Timberland and Nike Boots. ","The inventory turn improvements that Lauren mentioned are mainly coming in footwear as our apparel assortments for the most part are still not turning as fast as we\u2019d like. As I mentioned, the areas with the largest apparel challenges were the same as last quarter. The declines were about the same as last quarter as well with apparel down double digits at Foot Locker Europe and down mid-single digits at Champs Sports. Both divisions were once again affected by the fashion shift away from certain lifestyle apparel programs that had in prior years helped drive strong results in the category. On top of that, these divisions - in fact, virtually all of our male-oriented divisions - have seen a major shift out of licensed apparel, which is definitely not on trend right now.","That said, our combined U.S. Foot Locker divisions - Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker and Foot Action - again generated a mid-single digit comparable sales increase in apparel. Among the male banners, the gains were strongest at Foot Action where we have developed an assortment of established brands mixed with smaller fashion forward vendors that has really resonated with the Foot Action customer. Overall, the apparel results in the U.S. lacquered divisions were led by branded fleece, including trend-right pants and hoodies as well as t-shirts, shorts and hats that tie back to our premium footwear. Tech fleece from Nike was strong, and Tiro pants from Adi continue to sell well. ","I\u2019m now supposed to turn the call over to Ken, but before I do that, I\u2019d like to offer him my deepest gratitude on behalf of the entire team here at Foot Locker. The accomplishments of the company over the last five years have certainly been a true team effort, but clearly Ken has been the catalyst to build the momentum we have in our business today. He\u2019s been an inspirational leader to everyone, a true friend, coach and mentor to me, and I can hardly thank him enough for all he\u2019s done - but I\u2019ll give it my best shot. Ken, thanks very, very much from all of us at Foot Locker.","Ken Hicks","Thanks Dick, I really appreciate that. It\u2019s been a real pleasure to work with you, the executive committee, and everyone in the Foot Locker community. That includes all of our terrific associates in the stores and facilities worldwide, our world-class vendor partners, our excellent landlords, and all of our other suppliers; and of course, that includes you on this call, our shareholder who have supported and believed in the company during its transformation, as Lauren said, into a high performance company.","I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with this team to contribute to the favorable situation the company is now in, which is we\u2019ve achieved a strong market position and solid financial footing. We have substantial growth opportunities ahead over the near, medium and long-term horizon, and a strong leadership team soon to be led by Dick that operates within a collaborative winning culture and that has the capability to build on our strengths, seize our opportunities, and develop new ideas to keep the momentum going, which I believe will be for a long time. We\u2019re on a path in the near term to achieve or come close to many of the long-term financial objectives laid out in our strategic plan in early 2012. We believe we\u2019re headed to the end zone in 2014, but we\u2019re not there yet, so we aren\u2019t ready to describe our next major game plan to you just now. We expect to share that with you in the spring of next year. ","For now, I\u2019ll just touch again on some of our key accomplishments. First, we produced 19 consecutive quarters of meaningful sales and profit growth, a remarkable record of consistency that we believe can continue. Second, we\u2019re in the perpetual process of differentiating our banners. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress from a merchandising and marketing perspective. We\u2019ve also developed exciting new store designs and we\u2019re still in the early chukkas [ph] of building those out. Third, through organic growth in stores and direct-to-customer, plus the successful acquisition and integration of Runners Point Group, we have successfully increased our European penetration. Our European business has held up financially through challenging economic times and continues to be a significant profit generator for the company. Fourth, we stepped up our children\u2019s business to be a more meaningful part of our overall business, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we\u2019re still seeing double-digit gains there. Fifth, we focused significant resources on our store banner dot-com business, which has been growing at close to a 40% pace for over the past two years. Sixth, we\u2019ve developed an exciting new concept for women, 602, which we believe will soon become a leader in serving the footwear and apparel needs of the athletically active young woman. Over the long term, we believe that 602 will become a billion-dollar opportunity for us. Seventh, we have very strong vendor partnerships which can be seen in the depth of our merchandise assortments, the variety of vendor shop-in-shops we developed in concert with them, and crucial for our future, the alignment of our key growth strategies with theirs. Finally, we\u2019ve made investments in the business in our store remodels, in systems, in facilities, and above all in our people to improve our capabilities and productivity. I believe our associates at every level have the skills, training and tools at their disposal to build on our momentum and deliver great product and services to our customers wherever and however they want.","With that, let me stop and just say again how grateful I am for the opportunity I\u2019ve had to lead this tremendous organization over the last five-plus years as its CEO. With all due respect to all the many other fantastic people I\u2019ve worked with over the years, this has certainly been the best job of my career and I\u2019ll miss it. That said, I know that this is the right time for me to hand the baton to Dick. He\u2019s ready and the company has earned the privilege of leading this great company on the next leg of its journey to being the leading global retailer of athletically-inspired shoes and apparel. ","Thank you all very much. Let\u2019s go ahead now and get to your questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question online comes from Mr. Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jay Sole","Hi, good morning. On the leadership transition, it\u2019s an exciting time in the company. Can you just take us behind the scenes a little bit and talk about some of the planning and the thought process that went into the transition, and the thought process around the timing of it?","Ken Hicks","Well, the transition has actually been going on for quite some time. We\u2019ve been making sure that Dick had great exposure within the company in terms of the different operations and activities, from leading our direct-to-customer business, our international business, and our largest banners in the United States, and then the corporate opportunity. We\u2019ve also worked to have him more involved in the investment community, on an outside board to enhance his development.","As we look at the timing, both longer term and the immediate, in the longer term we\u2019re coming out with a new plan and I believe that the new leader, or the leader who presents that plan and develops that plan should also lead during the planning period. That means that I think it\u2019s the right time for Dick to take over. On the micro sense, the way our business works, now is a good time to transition so that Dick will be in place to make sure that we\u2019re prepared for next back-to-school and next year. We\u2019ve got our program for this holiday in place, and it\u2019s really an execution program, and for our February business, so now is a very good time to make that hand-off, and I know that Dick is ready and prepared for it.","Dick?","Dick Johnson","Yeah, I appreciate that, Ken. I think the timing, as Ken said, there are no down cycles in retail. It\u2019s a new game every day, so it\u2019s a matter of picking the right point, and I guess the big benefit that we\u2019ve got is that Ken\u2019s going to be around as executive chairman and continue to be a bit of a mentor to me through our shareholder meeting in May. So the CEO position transitions December 1, and we\u2019re fortunate to have Ken around for a few more months. ","Jay Sole","Got it. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question online comes from Mr. Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. Congrats Dick on the new position, Ken on new beginnings, and for a great new set of Week of Greatness commercials. ","Ken Hicks","Glad you like them, Paul.","Lauren Peters","They're fun, aren\u2019t they?","Paul Trussell","So the footwear business is humming here. Just wanted to talk about some of the other areas, and Dick, maybe you can give us a little bit more color on apparel and just how we kind of self-correct that, both U.S. and Europe. What are expectations going forward? And then also the women\u2019s business, just want to understand a bit more how we get to the billion-dollar opportunity around 602 and what that means for the Lady Foot Locker banner, given that it has stabilized in sales.","Dick Johnson","Well I\u2019ll start with the apparel business, and as I said, the two weak points in apparel right now are Foot Locker Europe and Champs Sports, but some of our other banners are actually having some significant success in apparel, so it\u2019s just the penetration in those two banners happens to be a little bit higher. They have suffered a little bit as the trends have changed. They had some significant lifestyle programs in the past that really drove the business, and those programs have fallen out of favor a little bit with the consumer. We\u2019re seeing some success in certain items, but we don\u2019t have strong entire programs to drive those businesses right now, so as we see success with items and we grow around that, I think that we\u2019ll see those businesses improve. I know the team over in Europe and the team at Champs is working hard to make those changes.","I also believe that over time as we get our remodel program a little bit farther along, those remodels are being done to help us tell better stories and showcase apparel, so as that all comes together, I really do believe that the apparel business will improve across the board.","As it relates to the women\u2019s business and 602, the long-term optimistic view is that we can get that to be a billion-dollar business. We\u2019ve got a number of billion-dollar men\u2019s banners; there\u2019s no reason that we shouldn\u2019t have a billion-dollar women\u2019s banner. Over time, Paul, we\u2019ll transition properties. I mean, the challenge with our Lady Foot Locker stores, and you\u2019re 100% correct - they have stabilized themselves a bit as the team has focused on getting the product assortment right, et cetera, the 602 stores - and I think you\u2019ve seen a couple of those, Paul - are slightly bigger, and we need a bigger footprint to drive the apparel business the way that we expect it to be driven for this active female consumer.","So I think that when we get to spring and we roll out our new plan, we\u2019ll have a lot more to talk about on the women\u2019s side; but we are optimistic about how we\u2019re going about the process, and as we\u2019ve talked about, there is a portfolio of Lady Foot Locker stores that we have to manage our way through. It\u2019s not that we can just slap up a 602 sign and move forward, so the team\u2019s evaluating where we\u2019re at from a lease perspective, the timing of the rollout, et cetera. We\u2019ll have a lot more to talk about that when we get to our new plan this spring.","Paul Trussell","Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful color. Just turning quickly to the European business, if you can just discuss a bit more about consumer there in those markets. What\u2019s kind of the store rollout plan as you see it going forward, especially given a full year now of integration with RPG?","Ken Hicks","We continue to see good opportunity in western Europe, Paul. We\u2019ve got growth opportunities with our Foot Locker banner. We\u2019re also remodeling stores over there, so the real estate strategy is a combination of door rollout, remodels, and vendor shops similar to what we do here in the U.S. As it relates to rollout with RPG, we\u2019re going through the process that we went through a few years ago here in the U.S. of segmenting Runners Point, Sidestep and Foot Locker, making sure that they can co-exist on the high streets in the malls in Europe, so that plan continues to develop. Again, while we\u2019ve got the running piece of the business segmented in our Runners Point stores, we\u2019re still working on what it looks like in Sidestep.","The one area that we haven\u2019t talked about a lot, specifically in western Europe, is the growth of kids there as well. We\u2019ve got a few Kids Foot Locker stores that we\u2019re testing. We do a great kids business inside our Foot Locker stores, so we think that presents a great opportunity in the European market as well.","Paul Trussell","Thanks a lot for the color.","Ken Hicks","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question online comes from Mr. Matthew Boss from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Hi, good morning, and congrats on a great run, Ken. Can you guys talk about progress with localization and opportunity with your merchandise allocation system pilot that you guys have been working on?","Dick Johnson","","The pilot is really farther along in western Europe. We\u2019ll see a lot of advantage come from that as the learning system begins to learn and anticipate how we\u2019re buying and selling product. I think that that will truly help our localization as we\u2019ll be able to flow the right product in the right color and the right sizes back into the stores quickly after we see what the initial reaction to the product is, and while we\u2019re optimistic about the rollout of the system, it will take some time to take full advantage of the benefits that we\u2019ll have. We believe that the benefits are many, so as we continue to get ready to pilot that system in the U.S., we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the benefits.","Lauren Peters","And they should be more than just localization too. Right place, right product, right time, it\u2019s going to help us with in-stocks, it should help us with more full-price selling, and it will help turns, so we\u2019re very excited about it.","Matthew Boss","Great, and then can you just walk through some of the underlying components of the gross margin in the quarter, specifically core merchandise margins, buying and occupancy leverage, and was there any impact from FX?","Lauren Peters","FX, no. The components were again leverage on the fixed, and we had some minuses, about 20 basis points, due to the CCS inventory liquidation, so that was a unique item. As we\u2019ve talked about before, the continued pressure on IMU, which is really a result of vendor and category mix, has been a drag, but we\u2019ve been able to offset that somewhat with our continued improvement in the assortment allocation, et cetera, that\u2019s led to lower markdowns. So it\u2019s a lot of ins and outs that added up to that 10 basis point improvement, but we would continue to expect the leverage dynamic going in our favor with that pressure in IMU somewhat offset by markdowns.","Matthew Boss","Okay, great. Best of luck.","Ken Hicks","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Omar Saad","Thank you. Ken, congrats also on a great run, and Dick on your new role ahead. A question on international. It sounds like you\u2019re doing an investor day or an analyst day next year, but kind of want to see how you guys are thinking about international beyond--get an update on how you\u2019re thinking about international beyond Europe. I kind of kept hearing that term, global dominant retailer in the category. I would love to hear your thoughts there, maybe from both of you.","Dick Johnson","Well, I\u2019ll start out, Omar. We\u2019ve got stores down in New Zealand and Australia as well, and we have stores in Canada, which is an international location obviously. We look at markets and evaluate markets all of the time and contemplate should we be there, how should we be there. We\u2019ve got franchise arrangements in the Middle East and in Korea that stretch our brand a bit as well. So we\u2019ll continue to evaluate markets and opportunities, and I hate to keep referring to the spring but we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about what some of those could be; but at this point, there\u2019s nothing on the short time frame.","Ken Hicks","Yeah Omar, we are looking all the time at opportunities, but we also want to make sure those opportunities are accretive to the overall company. I think that one of the things that you see within the industry from the vendors, the growth opportunities, quite ironically, are really North America and western Europe are the developing countries. They are providing some of the strongest growth, and we happen to be strong there so we\u2019re taking advantage of that, but that\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t look at other opportunities. We do, but we feel based upon the items that I laid out in my discussion between women\u2019s, kids, apparel, the format opportunities that we have, and dot-com, that we have a tremendous opportunity where we are, and we don\u2019t want to pull away from that at this time.","Omar Saad","Understood, thank you guys. A quick question for Lauren. Just on the gross margins again, the 20 to 40 BPs for the second half going from plus-10 in 3Q implies an acceleration in 4Q. Is just the CCS, working through that and having that behind you in fourth quarter, is that really the big swing factor, or are there other things going on there? Thanks.","Lauren Peters","Yeah, when you compared Q3, Q4, yes, it was unique in Q3 that we had that CCS liquidation.","Omar Saad","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question online comes from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Camilo Lyon","Thanks. Let me add my congrats to Ken, and all the best to you in your future endeavors. Just had a couple questions. Lauren, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the IMU pressure that you\u2019re facing, and you\u2019ve been able to offset that through better inventory markdown management. Is there any outlook that you can provide into next year on how that will play out? Are we kind of plateauing at a level of IMU pressure, or should we expect the same level of increase in IMU pressure that you\u2019ll have to offset next year? Any helpful insights there would be appreciated.","Lauren Peters","Well as we\u2019ve said, this year\u2019s been a result of category and vendor mix, so we\u2019ll see how that plays out next year; but our focus is on controlling what we can control, and that\u2019s improving our flow, getting those assortments as good as they can be, and investing in technology, as we\u2019ve already talked about that allocation tool should help us. The levers remain the same. Our mission is to get the most out of what we can control.","Ken Hicks","Yeah, the real focus for us is on productivity, and we see the opportunity into the future based upon what we\u2019re doing with investments and steps we\u2019re taking to improve productivity of the three major resources that Lauren talked about in her presentation as opportunities to continue to improve gross margin and as we work on things like our new allocation system that should also help us in both productivity and the markdowns that we have.","Lauren Peters","You know, when we hit the top of our game on apparel, that would--","Ken Hicks","Apparel is another one. That should be accretive also. So there\u2019s three things that we control that we think will help us improve there.","Camilo Lyon","So if we were to assume that vendor and product mix does not change next year, there\u2019s a reasonable expectation that merch margins should be up based on all the things you just said?","Lauren Peters","Yeah, so we\u2019ll talk a lot more about our expectations for next year in the spring.","Camilo Lyon","Okay, fair enough. My second question is could you help us understand the comp impact in the third quarter from the push-out of those two key launches?","Lauren Peters","Yeah, we\u2019re not going to peel that back. It gets a little bit too finite to try to do that.","Dick Johnson","I think Lauren did a good job of putting October and November together, which is really the way that you have to look at it.","Camilo Lyon","Right, and the LeBron 12 is now launching on the 1st of December, so that should be an incremental benefit to the December comp year-over-year, correct?","Dick Johnson","We\u2019ve got a lot of launches when we look at the launch calendar, and we like the way the launches line up going into the holiday season.","Camilo Lyon","Perfect. All the best to you guys. Thanks very much.","Dick Johnson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question online comes from Kate McShane from Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Kate McShane","Hi, thank you. Good morning. Ken, congratulations, and Dick, congratulations as well. My question is on the port disruptions. It sounds like for most of the companies that we follow, that Q4 is okay with regards to that; but when it comes to Q1, there might be a little bit more uncertainty. With inventory being so tight on the balance sheet, are you a little bit more concerned about what the port disruptions could mean going into 2015?","Dick Johnson","Well, we work with our supply chain and as appropriate, we make decisions on how we route product into the U.S. We\u2019re confident that cooler heads will prevail, and hopefully the slowdown or shutdowns are avoided; but our supply chain, I think, does a really good job of evaluating the situation and working with our vendors to route things so that we don\u2019t face any shortages.","Kate McShane","Okay, thank you. My second question is just with regards to performance running. There was some commentary around the category that maybe sounded a little bit weaker, with the exception of Brooks. Can you expand on that a little bit more?","Dick Johnson","I think the running silhouette is such a strong silhouette, and sometimes the innovation, if you will, comes through the more technical brands like the Colors that Run campaign we did with Asics, where that splash of colors was really vibrant and moved the needle with the consumer. Right now, the consumer is more on lifestyle running from a silhouette perspective and continues to like that product offering. I think that the performance running, and we\u2019re seeing what that does in our Runners Point Group, obviously it\u2019s still an important piece of the business, but Brooks was the standout on the technical side in our women\u2019s business. So the running silhouette is still strong, and I know that we\u2019ve shared before that the truth is most of the running shoes that are bought are not bought to really hit the roads or the track or the trail to run, so it\u2019s a lifestyle piece whether it\u2019s a technical brand, technical shoe or not. We like the running category and feel comfortable where we\u2019re at today.","Kate McShane","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Krasik from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. ","Scott Krasik","Yeah, hi everyone, and let me add my congratulations and good luck, Ken.","Ken Hicks","Thanks Scott.","Scott Krasik","So just wanted to ask about pricing, and maybe specifically pricing in basketball. I think there\u2019s been some growth in the retro pricing, the LeBron on the new 12 that was launched a few weeks ago was the same as last year. Do you expect to continue to benefit from pricing overall in the next year, and how are some of those decisions made? Thanks.","Dick Johnson","Yeah, I think that we have not seen the end of the pricing elevation. We certainly think that as long as our vendors continue to bring excitement and innovation, our consumers are more than ready and prepared to pay for that product. We have a wide range of price points in our stores, and they inch their way up in some of the key marquee products. There is still some price increases going on, and to this point our consumers have been willing to pay. They think that the value for those marquee shoes in those higher price points is definitely there.","Scott Krasik","Okay, thank you. And then Timberland seems to be having a second life, or a third life. How significant, if you could just remind us, is boots in your fourth quarter, and can that move the needle? Thanks.","Dick Johnson","Well, our boot business is a small part of our overall business. I mean, it\u2019s certainly important and our Timberland investments and Nike investments are paying off very well right now. The needle moves based on our category and assortments, and of the big ones, boots are not quite as important to us but clearly a key piece headed into the fourth quarter.","Scott Krasik","Okay, thanks and good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Chris Svezia","Good morning everyone. Congratulations Ken, and all the best to you, Dick. I\u2019m curious - just on the remodels for Champs and Foot Locker, are they completed at this point as they enter into the fourth quarter, particularly for Champs at this point, and any color about what you\u2019re seeing - I know you\u2019re not going to quantify it, but just puts and takes in terms of what you\u2019re seeing? I guess apparel is doing better there than the regular base. Just any color around that as well, please.","Dick Johnson","Yeah, from a calendar year or fiscal year perspective, we go into a bit of a quiet period for remodels now through the holidays, obviously. We\u2019ll start back up in January with some projects, but as we\u2019ve said many times, our goal is to have about 50% of the fleet touched by the end of 2017, and that\u2019s our global fleet. So we are seeing some benefits to the remodels from an apparel perspective. Apparel penetration is better in our remodeled stores than our non-remodeled stores, specifically in Champs, so we believe that as the remodel program - and I think I mentioned that earlier - as the remodel program continues to roll out, we will in fact see some improvements in our apparel business.","Chris Svezia","Okay. Then on 602, just curious - I don\u2019t know if you want to add any color about what you\u2019re seeing there, but I think previously you might have commented that you\u2019re seeing very high conversion out of those stores. I think it was a traffic issue. Could you just maybe add any color about what you\u2019re seeing or what\u2019s been going on with 602 on that front?","Dick Johnson","Yeah, you called it exactly, Chris. Our conversion is high, our traffic is improving but still not where we need it to be. We\u2019re doing some fantastic grassroots marketing. We just hosted a 602 kilometer run down in Dallas and had great turnout on a less-than-ideal day for a road race, but we really gained significant social impact from the social media impact of the run and the after-events. So we open our 15th 602 today or tomorrow, so then we\u2019re done for this year; but as we get more stores and get them clustered in markets, we expect the brand recognition to go up, which will in fact help the traffic. So again, we\u2019re optimistic about the brand.","Lauren Peters","When we get her across the threshold, she likes what she finds. We\u2019re the place where she can go and get the head-to-toe look that works for her, and that\u2019s important to this customer.","Chris Svezia","Right, okay. Last question I have is just on the product pipeline in marquee basketball. Besides Jordan retro and the LeBron, are there any other shifts you see coming, or does it line up pretty well? You\u2019ve got some good product coming down, you have higher price points, it looks like that Jordan Retro 6 in those more traditional colors right on Black Friday, looks like it could be really strong for you guys. Just any color about what you see in the pipeline would be helpful, thanks.","Dick Johnson","As I\u2019ve said, Chris, we like the way the released shoes line up going into the holidays. Obviously our Week of Greatness is a significant campaign for us. We try to stretch what was a Black Friday impact through a week-plus, and then when you look at the launch calendar, and I know you all have access to launch calendars, as you look at the launches that go out through the holidays, we like the way things line up.","Ken Hicks","And for our business, it even goes beyond the holidays with the December 25 shoes that the players wear and what we do after Christmas. So we feel good about that, and we feel good about the line-up that we\u2019re seeing that goes into February too. So from what we have visibility of, it\u2019s a strong calendar.","Chris Svezia","Okay, sounds great. All the best to you guys. Happy holidays. Thanks.","Dick Johnson","Okay, thanks Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question on the line comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Seth Sigman","Great, thanks, and I\u2019d like to add my congratulations as well. If I could just follow up on the 602 commentary, the billion-dollar target you mentioned, what does that imply for the ultimate store build-out for that concept, and what\u2019s the right way to be thinking about unit growth for that business on an annual basis? And then I guess the second piece of the question is more just on the competitive landscape in that category and how you see that ultimately evolving. Thanks.","Ken Hicks","I think when you look at the build-out, we will be thoughtful and somewhat methodical. One of our competitors was very proud that they build their 100th store in their eighth year with the brand. We should beat that quite handily based upon the success and what we\u2019re seeing, but we\u2019re still going to do it in a thoughtful way. As Dick said, we\u2019re looking at markets where we can be more concentrated. We also feel we offer something very different from the competitors in the point that we have brands that a customer can put together that have their best product. We offer, as Lauren said, head-to-toe with apparel and footwear, and the best, if you will, of footwear and the best brands. So we\u2019re differentiated, and if a person just wants one fit or one style, the specialty stores, some of the other competitors, that\u2019s what they offer. We offer an assortment that a woman can\u2019t get anywhere else, and so we feel good about our positioning and we also feel good about this, as Dick was just talking about, and the customer has come back and said, I really like this. We just need to get more customers to know about it, because once they know about it, they come, they buy, and they buy a lot because in addition to having higher conversion, it also has high average tickets.","Lauren Peters","And if she comes to us, we can give her great customer service and help her get her fit right. That\u2019s not something everybody brings. ","Seth Sigman","For sure. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just shifting gears to the Foot Action business, nice acceleration in that business this quarter. Were there specific product drivers that maybe helped that, or is it just more representative of other changes you\u2019re making within that banner?","Dick Johnson","It\u2019s a combination of both. I think the mix that they found from an apparel perspective with the true core athletic brands, and then some of the faster fashion brands from a lifestyle perspective, have really benefited Foot Action. We\u2019re in our prototype phase of our rollout of remodels there, and the early indications are very positive as well. So I think it\u2019s really a combination that they found that sort of faster lead lifestyle vendor mix as well as a focus on customer service and doing the right things in the store to hook things up, and some really solid grassroots marketing around specific stores and specific events.","Seth Sigman","Okay, thanks and good luck ahead.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question online comes from Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Tracy","Hi guys. Good morning, and I know these congratulations sound sort of obligatory and clich\u00e9, but honestly Ken, tremendous job, and Dick, really wish you the best of luck on the next step.","Dick Johnson","Thank you, Eric.","Eric Tracy","So I guess if I could for either Ken or Dick, on the product pipeline as it relates to basketball, I know you guys feel really good about sort of the positioning into holiday, but as we kind of step back bigger picture, how do you balance working with the vendors in terms of the price point, the escalation there, sort of what is the right level, and then maybe even from a unit perspective making sure that these launches aren\u2019t getting kind of flooding the market with new product. Clearly the demand is there as it stands now, but how do you think about balancing that, not just in holiday but really on a go-forward basis?","Dick Johnson","Well you know, I think it\u2019s not just balancing it in basketball, Eric. It\u2019s balancing it across categories as well. I think that certainly we see some price escalation on the marquee product that I talked to earlier, but we\u2019ve also got some great product in lifestyle running that may be the shoe of choice for the consumer on that given day, whether it be the ZX Flux, the Roshe - I mean, those are also very fashion-right and desirable shoes for our consumers. So we work--I think our teams do a great job working with the vendors in terms of addressing price points, elevating where we can, making sure that we\u2019ve got the right price-value relationship, making sure that there\u2019s innovation in the product, whether it be color, whether it be technology, whether it be taking some older shoes and contemporizing them for today\u2019s consumer. I mean, that\u2019s the New Balance reference that I made before.","We talk a lot about basketball, but I just have to keep stressing how important the running business is as well, especially outside of the U.S. but even in the U.S. with the comp gain we had. So our consumer moves fairly quickly, and while they love their basketball sneakers without a doubt, they may feel like slipping on a running shoe for this occasion, and that\u2019s where I think the strength of our assortment and our vendor mix really comes through. ","Eric Tracy","Okay, fair enough. If I could switch a little bit to the apparel business, is there any chance that the vendors are somewhat limiting the branded component of that business? Clearly it\u2019s shifted away from licensed to branded. Women\u2019s clearly is resonating quite well, because it seems to be an underserved sort of distribution for women\u2019s apparel there. But as you think about the brands and they\u2019re trying to segment the market, is there any limitation of what they can sort of put through the Foot Locker banners, or is it just literally the timing and getting to that stage?","Dick Johnson","Yeah, I don\u2019t see, Eric, that we\u2019ve got any limitations. I think that it\u2019s more timing and our decision-making process on when to move from silhouette or style or assortment piece. So it\u2019s we\u2019ve just got to get our decision-making and their assortment presentations lined up together, so there is no limitations. I think that from a segmentation point of view, they understand that we sell premium footwear and we want to hook up the right premium apparel and accessories with that. So I think, as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re getting better but we still have work to do on apparel.","Eric Tracy","Okay, and just lastly, capital allocation - obviously a tremendous job in terms of returning value to shareholders in dividends and buybacks. As you think about the international opportunity, is there--again, without commenting specifically, but other things in play where you think maybe just not going organic, that there are some other assets potentially in play. I guess the question, are there some other things that we think about, M&A potentially, in the future as a--","Ken Hicks","Yeah Eric, we constantly look at opportunities. We obviously--the Runners Point was a very interesting, very good transaction that Dick and Lauren led, and it has been accretive since the day we bought it. But we also look at smaller things. We went into the Czech Republic, we bought a nine-store chain there that helped us establish a position. So we\u2019re looking at opportunities in Europe that will allow us to position ourselves properly in each of the markets that we\u2019re in, which is just about all in western and central Europe. So if we see the right opportunity, but we also want to make sure that it\u2019s a positive opportunity, and I think from what you\u2019ve seen, when we\u2019ve done something, it\u2019s been a positive opportunity and we haven\u2019t done something that is going to create a problem. ","Eric Tracy","Absolutely. Thanks guys. Best of luck. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question online comes from Robby Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robby Ohmes","Morning. Thanks for taking my question, and Dick, congrats on your new role, and Ken, best of luck in any and all next endeavors that you have. I wanted to just ask you guys about the promotional environment. One of your competitors had an uptick in their promotions this season following some excess inventory in some Nike product, and then I also wanted to see if you guys had any view on the increase in apparel that we\u2019re seeing in Nike and Under Armour at Macy\u2019s as we head into holidays, and just sort of what your outlook is in both footwear and apparel--in athletic footwear and apparel in the malls, and if you\u2019re seeing any uptick in competitive promotional activity. Thanks.","Dick Johnson","Well, we monitor the marketplace all the time, Robby, and I think the basic premise of our business model is that we sell premium products. I think that our vendors do a really good job of segmenting those products and making the right distribution calls in the right channels, so we have markdowns in the store. Some of those are things that we bought too much of, didn\u2019t move as fast as we wanted it to - whatever. So it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have promotional markdowns, but again, based on the strength of our business in the premium end, I feel comfortable with where our promotional cadence is, and obviously that\u2019s something that we evaluate on a daily-weekly basis. ","In terms of the mix of apparel that\u2019s going into Macy\u2019s, we have seen some expansion and some extensions. They do apparel different than we do. They can dedicate a lot more space to apparel, so I think that our team is doing a better job of picking the sharp points and making sure that we get the right product. So it\u2019s not about more for us, it\u2019s about more of the right stuff for us.","Ken Hicks","Yeah, we don\u2019t have our head in the sands, and where appropriate we\u2019re taking pricing action; but we got the sales increases that we got with lower markdowns than last year, as Lauren said, and part of it is the way we present the service, the level of assortment, part of it is the exclusivity that we have on products, and we will continue to work on that. But it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re being more thoughtful as we expand the apparel, is we are a premium house and we will have a strong Black Friday, and we won\u2019t have all the promotions that some of the other people do. We have a different strategy than some of our competitors. They get into situations that may cause them to have some pricing issues. We work hard, having tight inventory control, having tight assortment control, making sure we work closely with the vendors to try to minimize that impact.","Robby Ohmes","That sounds great. Thanks so much, guys. ","John Maurer","Okay Operator, we have time for one more call, or one question, rather.","Operator","Our last question comes from Mr. Michael Binetti from UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, good morning, and let me add my congratulations Dick and Ken. Lauren, if I could just ask for a little bit of detail for our model on the gross margins here, because I think it will be important. In the past, on the kind of comp that you just did, we\u2019ve seen somewhere to the tune of 70 to 80 basis points of leverage on the buying and occupancy line in the gross margin. I mean, is it directionally wrong to think that that\u2019s where you ended up this quarter with a similar comp, and if that extends going forward, it looks like you\u2019d be able to give up anywhere from 30 to 50 basis points on the merchandise margin to get to your guidance for the year. Is there any way that at a high level directionally, you would bless that kind of thinking?","Lauren Peters","We guided to 20 to 40 basis points.","Ken Hicks","Yeah Michael, as Lauren went through, there are a lot of puts and takes to get to where we came out. We continue to see those into the future that will be on the positive side, so--","Lauren Peters","We get good leverage on the fixed, Michael, but going back 70 to 80 would be going back a ways.","Michael Binetti","Okay. If I could just talk about Europe then for a minute, obviously you guys brought up the segmentation. I think we talked about that a little bit in the quarter, Lauren. Where are you, because obviously the segmentation you did between Foot Locker and Champs and Foot Action in 2010 has driven a lot of good results here. Can you tell us what we\u2019re going to be looking at over the next few quarters as you guys start to put a segmentation strategy in play in Europe, and then as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, Europe has traditionally been able to achieve operating margins that are above the U.S. Can you talk about where that business is today, and does that have a chance to go back above the U.S. as you guys start to put that strategy in play?","Dick Johnson","Yeah, from a segmentation point of view, I think we talked about it either last quarter or the quarter before, we will span the gamut from Sidestep being more fashion-forward, so connect that a bit, if you would, with Foot Action except there\u2019s no apparel. Foot Locker will sort of be in the middle - sport, fashion, leisure, athletic, casual driven, and then Runners Point will be out on the performance--you know, more on the performance end, not that they won\u2019t have lifestyle running options as well and a little bit of apparel for the technical runner. So we\u2019re through Phase 1 of that - we\u2019ve got the Runners Point stores in Germany situated the way that we want. They\u2019re working to change out the assortment, making it a better his-and-hers sort of environment with men\u2019s on one side, women\u2019s on the other. So all of the work is in process with Runners Point.","Foot Locker is well established with their assortment in their key customers, target customers in Germany, and the next step is to get Sidestep positioned properly in Germany. Once we feel like we\u2019ve got the model right in Germany, we\u2019ll look at testing that model across the border and outside of Germany to see where it can roll out. We have a lot of premises. We believe that Runners Point may be more successful in the north than the south. We think that Sidestep could have a better future in the south than the north, so we\u2019ll have to play the testing game a bit to figure out exactly what the rollout looks like. But we\u2019re confident that the three of them can coexist, very similar to the positioning of Foot Locker, Foot Action and Champs from the male perspective. Obviously Foot Locker does a lot of women\u2019s footwear business and a lot of kids footwear business in Europe, and we throw in the KFLs that we\u2019re testing and we feel like we\u2019ve got a great portfolio to roll out over the future. ","In terms of the profitability, Europe is definitely profitable - highly profitable - for us, and we believe that it will continue to be and continue to gain some leverage as we go forward.","Lauren Peters","And Michael, we\u2019re riveted on our productivity no matter where we operate, and there\u2019s nothing structurally that doesn\u2019t let Europe be as productive and gain in productivity from the great segmentation that Dick just described.","Michael Binetti","Right, okay. Thanks a lot guys. Congrats on a good quarter.","Ken Hicks","Thanks Michael.","Dick Johnson","Thank you very much.","Lauren Peters","Thank you all.

Maurer","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call.","We\u2019re pleased to have announced this morning record financial performance for both the quarter and the year. In the fourth quarter, we earned net income of $121 million or $.81 per share, an increase of 19% bringing our full year earnings to $429 million or $2.85 per share. These full year earnings compared to the $2.58 per share generated in 2012.","On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.82 per share in the fourth quarter, a 28% increase over last year's 13-week non-GAAP earnings of $0.64 per share. For the full year on a non-GAAP basis, we achieved a 16% increase in earnings per share to $2.87 from $2.47 a year ago.","As we describe changes in quarterly or annual ratios and margins during this call, we will be referring to non-GAAP results that also exclude the extra week in 2012. Since in our view, this approach provides the most useful basis of comparison.","In this morning's press release, we have included a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and in the 8-K filed this morning, there's a detailed calculation of our non-GAAP performance measurements.","Here with me this morning to provide the details are Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Ken Hicks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","We have a lot of ground to cover this morning, so I'll hand it right over to you Lauren.","Lauren B. Peters","We sure do, John. Thank you, and let me thank all of you who have joined us this morning to cover the details of a Foot Locker\u2019s 2013 results and to hear about our current view of 2014.","Noted in our press release this morning, the fourth quarter of 2013 was another strong performance by our company. Our best fourth quarter as an athletic company. We achieved a solid of 5.3% comparable sales gain and a 9.7% of total sales gain, lifted by our comps and $70 million of sales by Runners Point Group.","The fourth quarter sales results brought our full year total sales to $6.5 billion, another record for us and 6.6% increase over the last year's 52-week results of $6.1 billion.","Most of the broad trends we saw throughout the year continued in Q4. For example, our strongest segment was our direct-to-customer business, which generated a 13% comparable sales increase.","Within that segment, Eastbay was up low single-digits. CCS was down high teens, and our store banner.com sites were up, again more than 40%. In fact, our store banner.com sales were up more than 40% for the year overall, a second consecutive year at that level, and a third consecutive year with at least a 30% increase.","Within the store segment, we produced sales gains in every region in which we operate. In the U.S., our improvements were led again by our children's business, with Kids Foot Locker itself up low double-digits in the quarter.","Foot Locker in the U.S. also posted a strong result, up high single-digits. Footaction was up low singles, while Champs Sports and Lady Foot Locker were down slightly.","Internationally, our Foot Locker Asia-Pacific business had a terrific quarter, generating a low double-digit sales gain, while our businesses in Europe and Canada were up mid-single-digits.","Comparable sales were positive throughout the quarter. With November up low single-digits, December, the month you really want to hit the ball as far as you can, was up high single. And January was up in the mid-single-digits.","By category of business, footwear was the driver of our success in the quarter, with a gain in the mid-single. Average selling prices and unit sales were both up.","Basketball was definitely the strongest component of footwear, with many divisions posting double-digit gains. In the U.S., running was down a bit which is not too much of a surprise given the challenging winter weather much of the country experienced during the quarter.","Internationally, where the weather was relatively mild, we had solid gains in both running and basketball. Apparel and accessories sales were down mid-single-digits.","Average selling prices were up a tick, but unit volume was down. We continued to transition our assortment towards the more premium offering. Dick will talk more about apparels in a few minutes.","Turning now to the rest of the income statement, our gross margin ticked up 10 basis points in the quarter to 32.5%. For the full year, our gross margin rate was flat at its record high levels of 32.8%. The familiar pattern of fixed cost leverage offset partially by a lower initial market break was evident in the fourth quarter.","Unlike most of the year, however, in Q4, we did increase markdowns slightly higher than last year in order to ensure that our inventory position remained fresh going into 2014. We believe that strategy worked well as inventory at year end was up just 4.5% over last year, compared to the 9.7% sales increase I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks.","Using constant currencies and excluding Runners Point, our inventory was up just 1.3% and it was actually down slightly on a gross per square foot basis.","Footwear margins improved about 20 basis points while apparel margins fell in the quarter. The story was much the same for the full year. So in total, apparel penetration fell back slightly to 23.1% in 2013. And apparel margins still have yet to catch and surpass footwear margins.","We continue to believe doing so it's possible, but it will clearly take time and a lot of hard work. What we believe our margin and inventory business was strong, it was our expense management that as CFO, I was particularly proud of.","Our SG&A rate improved 110 basis points, 20.3% in the quarter and for the full year; we came in at a record low 20.4%, down 60 basis points from 2012\u2019s rate.","Topline growth coupled with diligent expense management is a powerful combination. I\u2019d like to thank our many team members responsible for that accomplishment for a job well done.","In Q4, our store wages, the biggest component of SG&A declined almost 20 basis points as a percent of sales, due to both a very strong performance by our store operations teams and to various technology tools we have implemented over the last year or so in order to improve our hiring and labor scheduling processes.","We also reduced our marketing expenses compared to a year ago, although we were still able to develop some very memorable marketing campaigns such as the All is Right campaign during the root Week of Greatness, which produced more than 1 billion -- billion with a B impressions over the course of the quarter. It was quite remarkable.","Our depreciation and amortization came in at $36 million for the quarter, 2% sales, and in line with our expectations.","Our tax rate came in below last year due primarily to the ongoing effect of certain recently implemented tax planning initiatives, which received a particular Boost in the fourth quarter due to a favorable development in our foreign tax position.","In fact these initiatives should enable us to achieve a somewhat lower tax rate going forward which I\u2019ll describe a little bit later when I provide our outlook for 2014.","The bottom-line was a very healthy non-GAAP net income result in the fourth quarter of $122 million, an impressive increase of 26% over Q4 2012. Our non-GAAP net income of $432 million for the full year was solid 14% increase over last year's record performance.","On an earnings per share basis, we improved 28% in the quarter, $0.64 to $0.82 with the additional increase coming from the reduction in our outstanding shares.","As noted in our press release, we repurchased almost 1.6 million shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter at a cost of $63 million. That's brought our full year repurchase program to 6.4 million shares at a cost of $229 million, up appreciably from the $129 million we spent in 2012.","In addition to this significant return of cash to shareholders. We also paid $118 million of dividends during 2013. Last month we announced that our Board had authorized a 10% increase to our current quarterly dividend rate to $0.22. This is the fourth consecutive year with a meaningful dividend increase.","Overall in 2013, we returned $348 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. This amount represents more than 80% of our net income for the year. We also finished 2013 having spent $206 million in capital to invest in a variety of stores, digital, technology, and infrastructure projects.","I\u2019ll let Dick cover the details of the program in a moment, but suffice it to say, that even with funding all these initiatives plus the acquisition of Runners Point, we ended the year in strong financial position with $728 million of cash net of balance sheet debt.","We ended the year with 3,473 stores, an increase of 138 from the beginning of the year. Excluding Runners Point Group, our store-based decreased by 55 stores. That's the biggest decrease coming at Lady Foot Locker, Foot Locker in the U.S., and CCS where we closed all 22 of our CCS retail stores. The primary increases were in a Kids Foot Locker and in Foot Locker Europe.","Let me now turn the call over to Dick to add more color to the strong results. Before we get to your questions, I\u2019ll jump back into discuss our annual and quarterly expectations for 2014. Dick?","Richard A. Johnson","Thanks, Lauren. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to everyone on the team at Foot Locker for doing so much of to make this past year such a success. There were so many important contributions all around the globe that there's just not enough time to do justice to any of them -- to all of them, but rest assured, your efforts are truly appreciated.","For the fourth quarter, I\u2019ll touch on some of the key product themes that drove the business. I started off last quarter highlighting the strength of the Jordan brand and sure enough that brand continued it's very strong performance in all of our markets around the globe. Jordan Retro, Classic, and Performance shoes also sold well as did Jordan Tees, Fleece, Shorts and Socks.","Lauren mentioned that basketball was the strongest category in Q4 and so in addition to Jordan; we drove very solid sales results in the signature products. Innovative styles of LeBron, Kobe, and KD Footwear performed very well, along with Foamposits and certain other marquee player shoes.","Running was down slightly in the U.S., but within the category, we saw continued strength in Performance Running. For example, the relatively new SpringBlade program from Adidas sold well as did the well-established Nike Free.","Among the lifestyle running silhouettes, the Roshe Run from Nike has shown a lot of life, both in the U.S. and in Europe.","Lauren mentioned that Running was up in Europe and in addition to the Roshe, several Air Max style sold well.","Boots were a popular footwear choice in the quarter, especially Timberland and Nike. This was primarily a style choice because Timberland boots along with accessories such as knit caps sold in warm weather markets in the U.S. just as well as they did where it snowed.","Apparel sales were down a bit in the quarter. Jordan apparel was certainly an exception as the hook-up graphic in logo tees and fleece in particular sold very well. The apparel that hooked to the marquee player shoes also sold through at good rates.","It was primarily the more lifestyle-driven apparel that posted declines. There was a lot of pretty intense promotional competition in the mall for that customer during the quarter.","While there was definitely a place for some of the less athletic apparel in our banners, overall we will continue to focus on a more premium performance-based brand of assortment, which we believe is what our customers expect us to deliver.","On the accessories front, our Performance Sock business continues to expand as does the Backpack business which also tilts towards the premium end of the price spectrum, with fashion hooks to the key issues and apparel in our stores.","Turning to our 2014 capital program, we\u2019re targeting a total of approximately $220 million. We continue to generate strong sales lifts from most of the remodel formats we began rolling out in 2013. We have many different types of projects with very different amounts of capital spent per project. So, the lift required to justify the expenditure is also very different.","This is one of the reasons we\u2019ve not given a single number in terms of the sales lift from the remodels, but we watch carefully the financial performance of each and every project relative to our hurdle rates, and make adjustments to future projects accordingly.","In 2014, we expect to continue to remodel programs in Foot Locker and Champs Sports and expect to have touched at least 20% of the domestic Foot Locker and 30% of the Champs stores by the end of the year.","The basic reformatting of the Kids Foot Locker is already complete, but we do have a Nike Fly Zone shop in KFL that we\u2019re testing more of in 2014. We opened two new Footaction prototype stores in 2013 and based on their initial success, we plan to expand that test in 2014.","We\u2019re also very excited about the potential for new Jordan Flight 23 shops in Footaction. We have one prototype store now and we believe that this type of shop-in-shop will provide a real lift too many of the stores we have in the fleet.","We have allocated capital to both SIX:02 and Lady Foot Locker in 2014. First for SIX:02, we\u2019re continuing to build the brand and refine our model during the current test phase. The stores are doing well, but we need to continue reading our results, making layout and assortment adjustments, at least to the spring selling season before finalizing our rollout strategy. We will keep learning in order to maximize the potential of the SIX:02 banner.","For Lady Foot Locker, 2013 was a year of assortment transition, shifting out of lifestyle businesses and into fitness and performance. We\u2019re rolling out our Bridgewater format in many of our existing Lady Foot Locker stores this year.","Based on successful tests, our Bridgewater format is essentially a smaller scale version of the parks format.","You may recall that we have 19 parks format stores where we have adjusted the look of the store and the assortment to be performance-oriented like SIX:02, but still with the Lady Foot Locker name above the door.","Bridgewater is the new format which we\u2019re using which can be applied to a variety of store layouts including some of the smaller Lady Foot Locker stores that can't accommodate full performance apparel assortments of the larger stores.","In Champs Sports and Foot Locker, we have two different billion-dollar men's businesses in the U.S. and ultimately, we see no reason why we can't have $1 billion women's business also.","Finally, let me touch on our European business. Overall, Europe produced a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and improved profit contribution. As you might expect, some of these countries were stronger than others and one of the strongest countries was Germany, where we also added significantly to our business in 2013 by acquiring the Runners Point Group.","Runners Point Group generated a small profit in Q4 and was slightly accretive for the period in 2013 that we owned the business. We\u2019re satisfied with that initial result, and look forward to realizing the benefits from a number of merchandising, market segmentation, and operational improvements that we have started to make there.","With our heritage in running, Runners Point's biggest selling season is in the spring, and we haven't owned the business during that period yet. We fully expect Runners Point Group to be profitable in 2014, and the accretion should grow over the time as we develop the business and implement strategies to improve our financial and operation performance.","I'll hand the ball off to Ken now to add his perspective on the business.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thank you very much, Dick. Let me echo your thanks to the entire Foot Locker team that delivered these exceptionally strong results. During the last few years the team has built strong momentum in our overall performance. As a result, a diligently executing the many initiatives that support our strategic priorities we have delivered a growing number of strengths and opportunities upon which we can continue to build as we strive to reach our long range goals.","We have substantially diversified many aspects of our business in recent years. First, we have a very strong men's business and now our children's business is quite robust too. We also have a very solid strategy for the women's business to bring it up to the productivity level of the rest of the company.","We recognized that we could not accomplish that goal with the layout and size of the stores and the merchandise assortments in most of our existing Lady Foot Locker fleet. So we are undergoing a major transformation of the women's business that Dick described.","Second, our position in basketball is very strong, and we have also strengthened our running and casual footwear offerings as well as our apparel assortments. This has given us a better merchandise balance than before.","Third, we have clearly dedifferentiated our banners, enabling each of them to focus on a particular customer set whether it's on the performance end of this spectrum, such as Foot Locker, Eastbay, Runners Point and SIX:02; or the lifestyle end, such as Footaction, Sidestep and CCS. Meanwhile, Champs Sports is able to effectively serve customers across a broad athletic spectrum.","Fourth, we are no longer just a U.S.-focused company with a modest international presence. We are now a large global company. Including our franchise partners we operate well over a 1,000 stores in 29 countries outside the U.S., and along with our international and local country digital sites, we're approaching $2 billion in international sales.","And finally, we're not just a bricks and mortar business. We have a strong, fast growing collection of digital sites both in the U.S. and abroad. And we've grown our digital sales to be more than 10% of our total sales.","All of these strengths have provided us with an exciting number of opportunities to drive our business forward in the coming years. Fortunately, some of these opportunities are having an impact now and we expect that they will continue to do so over the relatively near-term, which I define is the next -- into the next year.","These include; first, our children's business across not just kids Foot Locker where sales increased at a mid-teen pace in 2013, but across all of our banners, channels and geographies.","Second, growth in Europe where we have seen recovery in most of our markets, and where Germany given the Runners Point acquisition is now our largest market. In the near-term, we'll focus on customer segmentation inside Germany and expansion of the Foot Locker banner in markets where we believe we are under-penetrated.","Third, improvements in our running and apparel business, both of these categories are strong, but growth slowed in 2013. Looking ahead, we have a promising pipeline of premium running products from many vendors including Nike, adidas, ASICS, Under Armour, Mizuno, New Balance and Puma.","Fourth, continued expansion of specialized presentations in our stores in partnership with our vendors. With Nike these include the House of Hoops, Yardline, Kids Fly Zone and Jordan Flight 23 shops. With adidas we have the Adi collective and original shops. And we've recently opened our first two Puma performance labs.","Fifth, we will continue to enhance the connectivity between our store banners and our banner ecommerce sites. We're stepping up our investment to make these sites more engaging, entertaining and shopper-friendly.","Finally, we use technology to improve our customer service, inventory effectiveness and productivity of our sales associates.","In the intermediate term of say two to three years, we have additional opportunities to build on our momentum. Examples include the cumulative sales lift of our store remodel programs as we start to hit critical mass, the potential expansion of the Runners Point and Sidestep banners outside their current markets, investing in technology, the most prominent example of which is the new merchandise allocation system we intend to roll out later this year. And the development of a more meaningful team sales and services business.","And Dick spoke about what is perhaps our biggest single long-term opportunity, the women's business. Between the promising SIX:02 banner and the merchandise assortment changes we're making to Lady Foot Locker, we believe we can create a large profitable women's business.","That's a lot of opportunities to seize upon, and not all of them will develop exactly how and when we've envisioned. But the breadth of promising growth and profit opportunities have just listed make for a very exciting future for Foot Locker not just this year, but I believe for many years to come.","Now, before we get to your questions, let me hand the call back to Lauren to talk more about the specifics of how we're planning 2014 and all the news that you've been waiting to hear. Lauren?","Lauren B. Peters","Thanks Ken. As we mentioned in the press release this morning, we are planning for a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit percentage EPS increase during 2014. Many of the themes from 2013 we expect to carry over into 2014 with one notable exception which is thankfully we don't have to worry about significant quarterly sales shift caused by that extra week in 2012.","So, in fact, we are planning for mid-single-digit comp sales gains in each quarter. Until July, remember, we will have incremental sales from Runners Point Group at which point their sales and expenses will be in both periods. RPG sales will be in our consolidated comp numbers starting in October.","On the gross margin front, we expect to experience some ongoing initial market pressure, but we believe we can continue to improve our markdown rates to hold merchandise margin relatively steady in 2014, and we should pick up leverage of our fixed cost to generate an overall gross margin gain of about 30 basis points to 50 basis points.","We should also lever the six elements of SG&A to produce a 20 basis point to 30 basis points improvements in our SG&A expense rate. We are currently planning for depreciation and amortization expense to increase to a range of $145 million to $150 million this year. Our interest expense we see being flat with last year at around $5 million.","Meanwhile, as I alluded to you before, our tax team has done a terrific job implementing various tax planning initiatives. And going forward into 2014, we are now expecting a 36.5% effective tax rate, down from our prior expectation of 37%.","We're planning for a $220 million capital expenditure program in 2014. We're anticipating of 16 new stores and we'll likely close about 100. We'll spend about the same amount this year on store remodels. At about 300 the number of projects in 2014 will be close to the number that the team executed last year.","The balance of the capital program will be spent on our technology initiatives, our digital sites, our logistics and other facilities, and our regular store maintenance requirements. We have $371 million left on our share repurchase program, which, as you have seen, we were active in executing during the period of 2013. We expect this share count to continue decreasing as we execute this program.","We intend to be disciplined with our inventory growth in 2014 with the goal of ensuring that inventory increases had no more than half the rate of sales growth. That inventory discipline has served us and the entire industry well in the recent years.","It also set us up for a solid start to 2014, and in fact, our comparable sales are up low-double-digits so far in the first quarter through yesterday. That said, there's still a long, long way to go on the quarter and the year, so we're going to stay focused on executing our initiatives.","In the meeting earlier this week, Ken said something about it being good to score a touchdown on the first possession of the game. It's certainly better than snapping the ball into the end zone for a safety, but it doesn't mean we're going to win the game if the team doesn't keep playing as fast.","So without better good news, let's get to your questions now. And John has just informed me that we have so many people in the queue to ask questions that we may not be able to get to everyone on this call. If you will all keep to just one question each, we'll get to as many of you as we can. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Hey, good morning guys. Congrats on a great quarter.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Lauren, one quick question. Could you just clarify the merchandise margins versus the volume occupancy in the fourth quarter for us? I apologies if I missed that in comments.","Lauren B. Peters","Yeah. We picked up in the fourth quarter 10 basis points improvement. So we got some leverage out of the occupancy. We gave it bit back in gross margins and that's about 10 improvement.","Richard A. Johnson","That's based on the 13-week to 13-week comparison.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. You're not breaking out both components, so.","Lauren B. Peters","No.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Can we just back up a minute and chat a little about Champs Sports. I think the -- you've said there've been the comps of Champs were negative in the quarter, I think they were as well in the third quarter. I know that that's been a focus of the remodeling program in that. I think the stores come out of the comp base as they remodel, perhaps that's what it is. But if you could just give us a little bit of the components behind what you're seeing at Champs and maybe their trajectory for that chain here this year. Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson","Yeah. The stores don't come out of the comp mix when we remodel and expand. But one of the things we talked about was the apparel being down slightly in the quarter. And you know that Champs is a great license product business and the teams that we have in the playoffs both professionally and in the college ranks were not the same level -- not at the same level of sales as the year prior. So we combine that with a few late remodels and I think that explains. We believe that by the end of '14 we'll touch 30% of the chain, so we think that will be a critical mass there with the remodels on the Champs fleet.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Can I just ask you, do you think -- do you expect the Champs business to be positive in 2014?","Richard A. Johnson","Yes.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Thank you. Have a great day.","Richard A. Johnson","Thanks.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roby Ohmes from Bank of America.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Lauren B. Peters","Good morning.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Hi Roby.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Hi. Couple of questions. The first one is just on the complement you're seeing now quarter-to-date, could you talk about what may -- what is driving that? And then, the sort of confidence in maintaining mid-single-digit comps through 2014. Ken or Dick, could you talk about the spring pipeline, about key exclusives that you may have, and then what sort of the apparel approach or assumption in maintaining those mid-single-digit comps. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Richard A. Johnson","Yeah. February obviously is an important basketball month. So we feel good about where February end and obviously in where we are quarter-to-date. We think the pipeline, as Ken mentioned I think in his comments from the Running perspective, we've got great Running silhouettes coming from many, many vendors along with great basketball performance product. And we have extended the basketball season certainly beyond the traditional season. So we're fairly optimistic.","And on the apparel front, obviously, we continue to make changes to more performance-based assortment in many of our banners. We see great opportunities with Under Armour apparels, with Nike apparel. So I think that we've got a pretty good confidence level albeit the mid-single-digit number is achievable.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","And the other question I have was on Europe. Could you remind us roughly where the operating margin of Europe has been, and where do you think you could take it to over the next couple of years if you're successful with Runners Point and some of the initiatives you have going on over there.","Lauren B. Peters","The operating margins have improved both in the U.S. and internationally. And we think that we still have a plane opportunity in both. It's a bit less promotional environment in Europe, so that certainly helps. But remember, that we've been adding stores in Europe, so you don't get the full flow-through that you do when you are just talking about comps.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks very much.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Roby.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group","Good morning, everyone. Great job on the quarter.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Chris.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group","Sure. I guess one of my big questions is, when you -- I know you're not going to update sort of your long-term targets, but if you kind of back into some of the assumptions here, you're getting pretty close to your 11% EBIT margin in 2014, just any thoughts about really where you think this business can go to and any thoughts about how we should we think about that as we move forward. Obviously, it seems like there's opportunity for that to go higher, just some thoughts around that.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yeah. Chris, we do believe based upon what I've talked about number of times, the continued leverage that we get with productivity. And I think one of the things that -- product stuff that we've done is to increase productivity of all of our assets, our real estate, our people and our inventory.","We think that as we continue to get things right in apparel and I continue to improve there and develop a stronger business there, continue to improve in women's and develop that business. We're seeing -- we're putting shoots on the new formats that we talked about plus the women's business in the other banners improving there, and the new allocation system that we're putting in, all will help us continue to drive the overall profitability. And obviously, it\u2019s not -- it can't be infinite, but we think we still have upside there.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. Thanks. And just on the apparel. I'm just curious, any color between private label and the branded side. And I guess as you think about 2014, do you think there's opportunity to actually comp positive in apparel as you think about the product pipeline, what you're doing?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yeah. We definitely believe that we can improve our apparel business. We continue to -- on our private label -- hold down the commodity elements and build ideas. We've got women's brand that's doing well, called Acura. We've got a brand in Europe called Sneaker Freak that's doing well. So our Champs Sports gear has done well.","So we've got the ability to develop a better element in our private label. The transition is a bit of a challenge as you pull something down and build something up. You can pull down faster than you can build up. We also believe that continued development of the premium apparel and how we show that and what we show is becoming more important. So our plans for this year are positive apparel.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. Sounds great. All the best to you guys in '14. Thank you.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Kate McShane - Citi Research","Good morning. My question is on Runners Point. You mentioned that it came in at a slight profit during the quarter. Do you have an alternate goal for the profitability of that banner?","Lauren B. Peters","I couldn't run the process that we do in most of our European business.","Kate McShane - Citi Research","And if there any -- I know you've been very happy with their ecommerce platform, is there any chance that it could be more profitable because of that?","Richard A. Johnson","That's one of the reasons why we -- Kate, why we think it could be more profitable. They've got the strong Tredex business. But they're a slightly different model. They have a smaller store. They replenish more frequently. And we actually think there's some things that we can learn because we have smaller stores in Europe than we do in the states from them on some of those supply chain elements, as well as they can learn from us on things like the allocation and distribution of products.","So we believe that there is an opportunity for continued profitability improvement. And as Lauren said, there's not a governor on it that would say it couldn't get to the level of the rest of the company. They were a profitable company when we bought them. But as we work and continue to leverage both the corporate office that we have there plus the real estate, inventory and people, we feel very good about Runners Point.","Kate McShane - Citi Research","Thank you.","Richard A. Johnson","Thanks Kate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. More questions about the store remodels. Can you give us on like clearly you got some significant lift over on kids, can you talk to me about with Champs may be the differential between the overall underperformance, and those particular stores that have been done in the quarter or last year because you did -- you were little negative there. Were the other -- were the redoes up?","Richard A. Johnson","Yeah. The remodels are up. We don't really break the chain apart and see how many in details, but you know, as I said in my comments, we monitor all the performance of all the remodeled stores and they are meet -- they meet our hurdles. We make adjustments along the way. So I think getting to critical mass with the Champs stores having 30% of them remodeled by the end of the year, will all quite positive in the Champs business.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We wouldn't be going forward with them, Sam, if we -- if they weren't performing well and performing better. And obviously, one of the things that it does, it allows us to better show the apparel which is a stronger business with them with the shoes, and so we've gotten good reaction from the customers on the new format.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Thank you. And then just real quick and a follow-up\u2026","Kenneth C. Hicks","The one other thing to keep in mind, the kid's and about remodels, the kid's stores will probably the easiest and most straightforward. And almost all of our kid's stores have been reconfigured. They're not really a remodel, but reconfigured. So one of the things that has helped the kid's business is that we've had that reconfiguring in all the chain. And the others are -- it's more of a process than it was in kid's.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Thank you. And then just real quick on Runners Point Group. Can you talk about what kind of, I mean, what kind of accretion that you're thinking -- that you think you'll get this year from it? And how you think what kind of accretion you're going to get from that? And what kind of sales growth you're going to get from it as well?","Lauren B. Peters","As you know, we don't breakout divisions individually, but we do feel great about what Runners Point will contribute this year. As Dick mentioned, spring is what they're running that is very important to them.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Thank you guys very much, and good luck.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. Thanks Sam.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Hi. Congrats on a nice quarter and especially quarter-to-date in this environment. Can you talk about\u2026?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","No problem. Can you talk about the business intelligence system, the localization initiative and kind of how this -- when this is rolling out and the opportunity here over a multi-year period?","Richard A. Johnson","Yeah. We've got BI in place right now. And I think that our merchants are doing a great job of understanding the market basket, what's been sold together, how the transactions are being put together in the stores. So that's something that from the localization point of view, we're already doing and working on.","I think Ken and Lauren and I have all mentioned, the merchandise allocation system, which is a much more detailed, much more in-depth process and initiative that we'll test this year and we'll be in a position to roll out completely in 2015, so.","Kenneth C. Hicks","The advantage that that gives us, quite frankly, is it will allow us better utilize the BI information that we have. Right now, we're getting BI information and we're inputting in our current systems, but we feel the new allocation system will allow us to better utilize the localized information in terms of product, sizes, quantities things like that.","Lauren B. Peters","It will really help us take assortment planning to the next level. Of course, because that's our planning impact that bears fruit go forward.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Great. And then can you\u2026","Lauren B. Peters","We're excited about BI that -- really that information has let us beyond products, so we're starting to see how it might be used to help us with operations and some other things.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Great. And then can you just touch on what the basis for the acceleration quarter-to-date? And do you think there's some pent-up demand on the Running side, given the weather that we have had as we head into the spring here?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, we certainly -- basketball is a big deal in February with the All-Star game and all of the events and the launches that happened in February. So that's certainly been one of the things that driven the quarter.","And our general belief in the U.S. is, yes, there's probably some pent-up demand on the running side. But given number -- as Ken mentioned, we're a stronger global business at this point and the winter has not been as difficult in many of markets in Europe, so running business was actually up in Europe for the quarter.","So in U.S., so yeah, we see some pent-up demand. We believe that there will be someone winter break -- inevitably break. We see some good things.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Congrats. Best of luck.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. Thanks Matthew.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew McClintock from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital","Hi. Good morning, and congrats to the entire Foot Locker team for a great quarter.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thank you, Matt.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital","Just I was actually -- wondering if you could update us on your thoughts about expansion. That expansion this year looks like another year of net store closures. And as you think about the comments earlier on may be taking Runners Point Group outside of its core markets, how do we think about that longer term just in general. Thanks.","Kenneth C. Hicks","One of the things, and it's little deceptive in terms of expansion. Because when you look at expansion, as we are closing some of our less productive stores, one of the things that we're doing is we're adding too.","We've got now well over 100 House of Hoops that makes our -- make our stores bigger, things like adding the collective or the Puma labs or the Kid's Fly Zone. Those are where we are taking more square footage, but cutting down on a number of locations, and helping our overall productivity both in terms of space.","So I think several years ago I was thinking, okay, you got to grow stores. We have a couple of things going on both in terms -- or first in terms of just the overall productivity that we're able to drive out of one location.","The second is the addition which causes larger stores with regard to the new concepts that we're putting in the stores. And the third is the growth of dotcom, and the ability for that to help -- to make us more productive not only online, but in our stores.","So I think what we're going to see is kind of a holding pattern around a level of stores, but a much more productive. We finished the year $460 a foot to four years ago we were doing $320 a foot. So that's over in three, four years, a third improvement in the productivity.","With regard to Runners Point, we want to get to know that business a little bit better, but we believe that based upon the success that we've had with them, based upon some testing we're doing by focusing their formats, we have the ability to expand the Runners Points stores and the Sidestep stores into other markets.","And the interesting thing about that is there's some markets, Italy, for example, that probably would be more receptive of Sidestep, and there are other markets such as Scandinavia or Holland that would be more receptive of Runners Point. Don't see that many Italians out running a lot, but they do want to look good.","And so, we think that -- and that's why we put it in that the mid timeframe as an opportunity that we can start expanding those chains into other markets than just greater Germany.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital","I appreciate the color, Ken.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. Thanks Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","Hi guys. Good morning. I'll add my congrats on great execution.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Eric.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","If I could just on the digital business, Ken, I mean now greater than 10% of the mix, may be just kind of update us again on strategy? Is there optimal sort of size of that business that you're thinking about? Earlier we saw somewhat of an inflection this holiday season in retail in general in terms of sort of migration to online. Really just sort of an update there from a banner perspective and the opportunity that you have going forward.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yeah our -- first of all, I think this last holiday was a little deceptive, because three weekends in a row before Christmas we have a big chunk of the country cut off from shopping has an impact, plus the industry didn't help itself with the mis-deliveries. That said, it's going to continue to grow and we're prepared for it. And we're doing a number of things.","One, we're updating our sites and what's on our sites and how they work. We've really -- I think, when you look at some of the new sites, you look at the new SIX:02 sites, look at our new Footaction sites, they are different and they behave differently than each other. We show more hook-ups and outfits on the Footaction site. You can go to SIX:02 and do intelligent search.","So we continue to update and upgrade that. We're looking at how we can bring more of that to the store and connect it to the store. We've added buy online ship to store, buy online purchase pick up in store. You can order in the store something that they don't have in their inventory and have it shipped to you.","So we've got a whole bunch of things that we're doing to connect the stores and the Internet. We are looking at things that we can do to connect even more and we're going to test something -- we're not ready to announce it yet -- but we're looking at a new idea that we'll test sometime hopefully this summer, but there is a significant opportunity to continue to grow and develop the dotcom business; and not necessarily at the expense of the store if we put them together.","Because the most used sites on our websites happen to be store-connected, store locator, inventory, things like that. And we're going to make sure that we are able to give our associates something so they are better connected. We are using handheld devices and all-in-one devices in the store. So we're using technology as an opportunity. It will grow.","What the peak is, as I told everybody, you set a goal of 10%. Now the 10%, by the way, is the banner.com, and we're not there yet. We did have a banner pass the 10%, but we've got to get all the banners up over it.","And as we do hear and I was alluded to earlier, when we get that goal we'll set a new one. And we'll move beyond. I think there is some limit. What that limit is, is it 20%, is it 30%, is it 40%, I don't know yet, but\u2026","Lauren B. Peters","The customer will tell us.","Kenneth C. Hicks","But customer will tell us because we're going to be able to grow both ways. What we want to do is give the customer the product the way they want it.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","That's perfect. Thank you. And then just real quick for Lauren. As we think about the gross margin next year, leverage on occupancy that may be a little bit maintained on that [IMU]. As we think about that relative to opportunities to mix of price.","And I know there's a certain segments of the business that are perhaps dragging on that, but we also know -- Nike in particular, is just starting to catch and push him pricing particularly within basketball. So, is there an opportunity there as you think about the pipeline for the year and is some opportunity for upside on that I am you if in fact you take some pricing?","Richard A. Johnson","Yeah, I think we continue to work with the merchants and try to figure out where the price sensitivity is. There's a lot of categories where there may be a little bit of upside, but we continue to face some pressures and I think I don't see it being significantly different in 2014 than it was in 2013.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, great. I appreciate it guys. Best of luck.","Lauren B. Peters","But, that's really why are we staying very focused on what are our other opportunities to improve that merchandise margin and there are other things that we can do. We work internally and very collaboratively with our vendors in figuring out how to flow the product better and the allocation system is owing to help us make sure that we've got a right place right time. All of those things come together to help us do more business at full price and that gives us some room there on that margin.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yeah, we believe and we work closely with our vendors to make sure that we get the best [IMU] and margin possible, but our focus is not -- we're not like the United Nations. Our focus isn't based upon negotiating with other people. Our focus is on what we can do.","We will negotiate with the vendors to try to get as much as we can and they work with us because we want us to be strong too. But at the same time, we\u2019re going to focus on what we can do and so that's why the things you hear us talk about and the number you hear us talk about our what we believe we can do.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","That's really helpful. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. Thanks Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse AG","Okay. Thanks. If I can just follow-up on the remodel work that you guys have done. It sounds like you\u2019re pleased with the improvement in sales that you\u2019re seeing in some of your stores. Just trying to dig in a little bit further where that improvement is actually coming from. Do have a sense of -- are you getting better traffic in those locations maybe some incremental customers? Or are you seeing better conversion, more attachments with the apparel assortment? Just trying to get a better picture of what's going on there.","Richard A. Johnson","All of the above. I mean I think when we remodel store; it adds some excitement to the mall. So, we see traffic come up. I think the ability to hook up and show through adjacent product the footwear and apparel hooks or accessory hooks has improved in all of the formats that we\u2019re rolling out.","And I think that that ability to hook up changes our conversion in those stores. So, I think that all of those levers work and I think the reasons that we've gone through the remodels are to do just that, to increase the flow of traffic, to make the floor more productive, to allow us to convert and hook up with a big investment going out the doors.","Kenneth C. Hicks","One of the things that happens in the retailers is sometimes -- you say well I want to change the format and do something. And normally in my life when the retailer does that, it's nice but you don't see the impact.","I give Dick and his team a lot of credit because we\u2019re seeing the impact from these remodels and as we said we got criteria, they are meeting and exceeding the criteria, so it's a good thing.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse AG","Okay, got it. And it sounds like apparel is a big piece there. Is there any way to quantify the apparel penetration in those stores versus the non-remodel stores or the company average, something along those lines?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yeah, there is. But we don't disclose it.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse AG","Okay.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We monitor it very closely.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse AG","Okay, got it.","Kenneth C. Hicks","But, if you look at the stores, one of the things that stands out more is that we got a better balance between apparel and footwear.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse AG","Sure. One other driver that you mentioned was the development of a more meaningful team sales and service business.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse AG","Haven't really talked about that much recently. I mean where is that business today? What's the opportunity there?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We -- it's a $2 billion business. All the players are pretty small. We had significant growth with the business this past year. We see the opportunity. We're in 11 states and we're going to continue to build those 11. We're going to continue to slowly add more. We're going to figure out how we can better hook the Eastbay and team sales, so I feel very good about it.","This business should be well over $100 million business and that's what we're working towards. We're professionalizing something that is kind of not very professional out there, but it's a big business.","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse AG","All right. Thanks for the color.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. Thanks Seth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Good morning, guys.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Hi Paul.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","I wanted to just go back to the conversation around the women's business. $1 billion is a big number. If you can just drill down a little bit more on what we should expect from the SIX:02 format as you continue to test that this year. What we think about how to drive growth in Lady Foot Locker long-term and is there any other avenues to reach that target outside of just these two formats?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we have three elements in our women's business. First is the Lady Foot Locker, which is our biggest direct women's business and the thing that we know is apparel is a more important part and we\u2019re through the new Bridgewater format which is basically a less expensive version of parks.","We are able to get a nice pickup with the apparel by putting more apparel and what the assortment is, and we feel very good about where we are with that and we will roll that out -- we\u2019re starting to roll that out this year and we will have a number of stores that we'll be putting in place.","Second, part of it is SIX:02. We\u2019re pleased with where we are in SIX:02, but we know we still -- there's still some tweaks and improvements. So, we\u2019re modifying the stores we have. We've got a few more stores we're going to be opening up this year and we would hope by the end of this year, we'll have a pretty good feel and that's something that we can move on and rollout.","And then the third element are the women's shoes and all of our other banners. And that is a sizable business. And we are better defined what Foot Locker women's is. What Champs Sports women's is.","And as we do that, between our female banners, which are very performance-driven, Foot Locker, which will be more fashion, Champs, which will be a mix of fashion and performance, we'll have a very strong business. And it's a $40 billion plus business at our level; I\u2019m not including the discount level, $40 billion plus business.","There's not a player that really has the heart and mind of that women. We\u2019re going to work to do that and we've got a team I think that's dedicated to that and we\u2019re pushing on it pretty hard.","Richard A. Johnson","We've got women's opportunities around the globe as well. We\u2019ve got a lot of women's shoes in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and when you think about Runners Point, half of the people are runner women. So, again, great assortment opportunities around the globe as well as in the U.S.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Good call.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","And just a quick follow-up since you mentioned those other countries, Dick, there's been no conversation about further international expansion. Obviously, I understand you have RPG still hasn't even been a year yet and you can roll out that format into other countries. But is there any thought process about further global expansion, particularly some of the bigger emerging market countries out there, like Brazil and China? Thanks.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We constantly look and evaluate and determine where we think -- if we could develop a meaningful and profitable business. I think that talking to people in our business, they said the last year -- who would have thought our two most developing countries are North America and Western Europe?","Some of the developing countries are having some significant challenges now. And we will evaluate and look and see when the right time is. But right now, we've got tremendous opportunities where we are.","Lauren B.

Thank you.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Hey, good morning. Great year.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Taposh.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","I wanted to just kind of dig more into this disparity between running and basketball. I get that the weather is obviously unfavorable for running, but I guess -- what percentage of your customers actually using this product for end use. And I guess the reason why I'm asking is there's obviously a very easy excuse for the running business, but is it really all weather? Is there an ASP thing going on there? Is fashion playing a role?","Kenneth C. Hicks","No, I mean, let's face it. The majority of our shoes are not used for performance. But we had -- there's been tremendous development between Kobe's KD\u2019s, LeBron\u2019s, Jordan that have really helped basketball.","We\u2019re seeing this spring a plethora of running -- that will help running. So, there's new product. You've got the new Boost. You\u2019ve got new Flies coming out. You've got the new shoes from Under Armour. There's a lot of new product coming that I feel will help running.","So, yes, the weather did have an impact, but it was the newness. There's some fashion. In fact, you look at some of the basketball shoes; they have a tendency to look like more like running shoes. But I think that the new idea is yeah, I\u2019m looking at some shoes here. Some KD\u2019s that John\u2019s wearing, they look like running shoes.","But what I think is that this will balance out and we sell through all of our channels we sell as many running shoes as anybody else out there. In fact, we got a stronger position with some great brands and we will continue to be a leader there.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","And what about this idea -- I know that women's wear daily article a couple weeks ago about white shoes making a comeback. I think, Dick you are actually quoted in that article. Is that a big deal or is that small and what does it actually mean for your business?","Richard A. Johnson","Well, quick, casual -- white-on-white, black-on-black shoes are -- there always a base business. They ebb and flow and when you look at things like Air Force One, K-Swiss shoes, they have their moments. And right now it feels like we're running into one of those moments. So, as Ken talks about the legs on our stool, one of those legs is casual footwear and certainly, the clean white plays into the casual footwear line.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Okay, great. All the best.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Okay. Thanks Taposh.","John A. Maurer","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Absolutely. Our final question comes from Bernard Sosnick from Gilford Securities. Please go ahead.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc.","Yes. Thank you very much, and my congratulations as well.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thanks Bernie.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc.","Ken with regard to the banners and digital, could you go over a little bit of the experience in developing those banners digitally, because that was a little bit late in coming relative to the digital cycle. How far along are you -- you said you've made it major differentiations among banners. What can we expect over the next few years?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, first of all, we really didn't get into the digital business -- push the digital banners until a couple of years ago. We were focused on Eastbay and [Dow] and his team I think are doing a much better job balancing that, still pushing Eastbay, but also developing the digital banners and when you look at footlocker.com, champssports.com, and connecting them with the stores.","So, we now are much more coordinated in what we do with the stores and dotcom. It used to be if they had the same shoe, up, go buy a lottery ticket that day because that was pure luck. Now they are talking constantly.","I've talked about the connection with by online chip to store, buy online purchase in the store, the inventory lookup, that using our stock locator. So, the connection and giving -- I was just down at our team weeks for both Foot Locker and Champs and the field leadership there -- and they were talking about -- do you know how many shoes you have in your inventory in your store? And they would say -- I have got X. You have got 250,000 SKUs.","And they go wow -- because you have got that stock locator and we\u2019re seeing much more of that. We\u2019ve updated a couple of the sites. We have more to update. We will continue to improve and adapt. We will continue to put more technology the store.","So, I would say we\u2019re still in the early innings. I feel that we're as far along as anybody else is. We probably don't toot our horn as much as other people, but we\u2019re as strong as I think anybody is out there in the capabilities that is meaningful and important to the customer.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc.","Thank you very much.

We refer you to Foot Locker, Inc.'s most recently filed Form 10-K or Form 10-Q for a complete description of these factors.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to John Maurer, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Maurer, you may begin.","John A. Maurer","Thank you, and welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter net income of $128 million or $0.83 per share. This is the highest quarterly earnings the company has ever achieved as Foot Locker, Inc. The EPS figure of $0.83 is an increase of 38% over the $0.60 per share that we earned in the first quarter of 2011, and also represents our ninth consecutive quarter of sales and profit increases over the comparable prior year period.","Our prepared remarks will begin this morning with Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review our first quarter financial results in more detail and touch on some key trends and factors likely to shape our results in the coming quarters. Ken Hicks, our Chairman and CEO, will then provide additional insight into the current business environment and comment on some of the major initiatives of our updated strategic plan that we outlined during our investor meeting back in March.","As always, will allow plenty of time for your questions after our prepared remarks. So let me turn the program right over to you, Lauren.","Lauren B. Peters","Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. 2012 has gotten off to a strong start, as seen in the earnings result of $0.83 per share that John just mentioned, a record level of quarterly earnings for the company as Foot Locker, Inc.","Reviewing the results in detail, we reported a 9.7% comparable sales increase, with strength both in our stores at 9.1% and in our Direct-to-Customers segment, which was up 16.5%. Recall that in last year's first quarter, we posted a comparable sales gain of 12.8%. Therefore, our 2 years stacked comp gain is a very strong 22.5%.","We noted on our previous call that February's comp gain was in the mid-teens. That was followed by a high-single digit comp increase in March and a mid-single digit comp gain in April. Although the comp trends may appear to have decelerated during the quarter, we believe this pattern was influenced by the relatively warm weather in March compared to April, which undoubtedly pulled forward some sales into March as did the 2-week shift forward of Easter. As evidence that our sales momentum is continuing, I can report that our May sales through yesterday are comping in line with Q1 at high-single digits.","With the exception of Foot Locker Europe, all of our divisions posted a comp gain in the first quarter. Let me start with Europe, since I know that is a current area of interest for investors.  We said during our earnings call in March that Europe's comp was down high-single digits since February. Fortunately, February is not a big month for Europe the way it is in the U.S. Europe finished the first quarter with a mid-single digit comp decline, meaning that the trends improved over the last 2 months of the quarter to a low single-digit decline. And within May's high-single digit comp gains for the entire company that I just mentioned, Europe is up low-single digits.","We do expect European economies to remain challenging, and there will be ups and downs in sales within our profitable European business. However, Ken will discuss, during his remarks, some initiatives we have in place that we believe position us to maintain our sales and profit growth in the European market.","Turning now to the strongest contributors to our first quarter results. Champs Sports posted a comp gain in excess of 20%, just as it did a year ago, meaning that Champs has produced a 2 year stacked comp gain of more than 40%. We are obviously very proud of the Champs Sports team and their results.","Our Direct-to-Customers segment was not far behind, with a 16.5% gain on top of a 21% gain last year. Excluding ccs.com, the balance of our Direct-to-Customers segment also posted a 2-year stacked comp gain of approximately 40%.","Although CCS' gain was lower than the rest of the segment, the division did have positive comps in the quarter, both in the direct segment and in the CCS stores. This indicates that the major rebranding that we launched in February is taking hold with customers, and provides encouragement that we will be able to turn CCS into a positive contributor to both our top and bottom line over time.","Among our other store divisions, Foot Locker in the U.S., Footaction and Foot Locker Canada all had strong comp gains that approached or exceeded the double-digit mark. All families of business, footwear, apparel and accessories, had strong comp gains, with apparel, once again, achieving an increase approaching 20%.","Within footwear, Men's and Kids continue to trend the strongest, while our Women's business was mixed. In Men's, basketball was the key driver, as we strengthened our leading position in our biggest category. However, we also had strong performances in many other areas, including Retro training footwear, Jordan and Adi classics, and seasonal items, such as slides. We maintained momentum in developing our running assortment, although the gains here were smaller. Increases in some lightweight running products such as Nike Free and new products like the New Balance Minimus were particularly strong.","As mentioned, Women's footwear results were mixed, with gains in technical and lightweight running, as well as classics, such as the Samoa from Adidas, offsetting weakness in some of the more basic programs in our Women's portfolio.","Our Kids footwear business was strong in almost all divisions, but particularly so in Champs and Foot Locker Canada, with gains in those divisions exceeding 30% for the quarter.","In the U.S., apparel gains continued to be particularly strong, exceeding 20%. The total company apparel gains fell just short of 20% due primarily to Europe, where our already strong apparel assortment experienced a small comp decline in the face of the tough market conditions there.  Our other international divisions posted double-digit comp gains in apparel. We also posted strong double-digit comp gains in hats and socks for the total company.","Turning to gross margin, our rate increased by 130 basis points in the first quarter to 34%. We continue to effectively lever our mostly fixed occupancy and buying cost, which produced 100 of the 130 basis point gain. The other 30 basis points was driven by a merchandise margin improvement.","Merchandise margins were higher than the last year across almost all of our U.S. divisions, led by the strong apparel performance. Our branded apparel business was particularly robust, a trend which has carried over from last year. Margins were down slightly in Europe compared to the first quarter last year, but the rate remains strong and our inventory remains fresh. For the entire company, footwear margins increased and stayed ahead of apparel margins, with gains in Women's and Kids footwear leading the way.","SG&A expense improved 110 basis points to 19.4% in the first quarter from 20.5% last year. Committed to flow through, our SG&A dollars increased by only $8 million, even while sales increased by $126 million.","We kept tight control of our store wages in order to improve our sales per payroll hour. Each of our divisions focuses on key productivity metrics such as this to improve our expense performance on an ongoing basis. We did spend $2 million more in marketing this year compared to last year, an investment which we believe continues to pay off. Based on our increased traffic and improving conversion rates, we believe we are bringing customers to our stores and Internet sites and they are finding exciting product assortments that fit their lifestyles. Even with our additional marketing spend, which is up substantially from just a few years ago, our 19.4% expense rate in the quarter is as good as it has ever been as an athletic company.","Our depreciation expense came in at $29 million, up a bit from last year's $27 million, reflecting the strategic investments that we have begun making in the business over the last year or so. On the other hand, interest expense was $1 million lower than last year, primarily the result of having extended our credit facility at the end of 2011 with significantly lower annual fees.","Our tax rate also came in slightly better than the 37% rate we planned for, as a couple of favorable prior year tax audit settlements allowed us to release reserves we have previously recorded.","The overall result for the quarter was net income of $128 million, the highest level of earnings in any quarter, not just the first quarter, in our history as an athletic company.","As proud as we are of that accomplishment, we remain focused on the many aspects of our business that we know we can improve upon. And we have multiple initiatives underway to do just that.","We opened 25 stores in the first quarter, the majority of which were in Europe, and closed 34, with most of those being in the U.S. We ended the first quarter with 3,360 stores, down 9 from the beginning of the year. Driving strong top line gains while replacing unproductive stores with profitable ones is a good recipe for enhancing many retail metrics such as sales per gross square foot and ROIC. We will continue to work with our landlords to close loss stores throughout the year and improve the overall productivity of our fleet.","Moving on to inventory. The productivity of this key asset also continues to improve, as reflected in the 1.1% decline in inventory while achieving an 8.7% increase in overall sales. On a constant currency basis, inventory was up slightly, compared to a 9.8% increase in sales. We closely monitor inventory aging by division and family of business and target our markdown strategically to move product that isn't meeting our turnover objective.  The merchandise flow initiatives that we have implemented over the past year and our fresher inventory levels have allowed us to increase sales with reduced inventory.","We ended the quarter with $909 million of cash and short-term investments, an increase of $110 million from the end of Q1 last year. In recent years, our first quarter has represented a peak in cash flow generation, with cash balances subsequently declining until we get to the year-end holidays.","We continue to increase our strategic uses of cash. Just this week, our board approved a $10 million increase in our 2012 capital expenditure program, taking the total from $160 million to $170 million. The additional $10 million is targeted primarily for new projects in the Women's business and for technology upgrades in allocation and warehouse management system. We continue to invest only in the highest returning projects [indiscernible] to drive our sales, profits and ROIC to new heights.","Shareholders are also being rewarded, with a dividend which increased 9% at the beginning of 2012, on top of last year's 10% increase, to $0.18 per quarter. We also brought in 878,700 shares in the first quarter, spending the first $27 million under the new $400 million share repurchase program that the board authorized earlier this year.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, let me touch on how we are positioning ourselves for the remainder of the year. Yes, we had a good first quarter result, driven by a comp gain that was almost double digits. As I mentioned, May is off to a similarly good start. However, we continue to plan the rest of the year in the range of a mid-single digit comp increase. We have consistently shown the ability to chase product to deliver higher sales gains if customer demand is there. But by planning cautiously on the top line, we also control our expense structure to ensure that our results do not suffer substantially from any slight shortfall in demand from the current pace.","Just as there are operational opportunities for us to improve our business, there are macroeconomic challenges both in the U.S. and Europe, and our multiyear sales comparisons continue to get more and more challenging. We believe we can continue to drive improved results over time, as reflected in the new long-range goals we outlined at our investor meeting. But we also believe in planning prudently, which enables us to react to trend changes more effectively.","Turning from sales to gross margin, we continue to anticipate leveraging our fixed cost with sales gains. But with merchandise margins already at or above peak in many divisions, future margin rate increases will likely be more modest than in recent years. The 30 to 40 basis point gain we mentioned on our last call still applies to the remainder of the year. When blended with the first quarter gain of 130 basis points, this equates to an annual figure in the 50 to 60 basis point range.","Similarly, we are planning SG&A expenses for the remainder of the year to be down as a percent of sales by 60 to 80 basis points. For the full year, the gain may be somewhat higher than that, given the first quarter's 110 basis point improvement.","Our depreciation expense is likely to come in a bit higher than the $110 million we mentioned on the last call, closer to $115 million. Our tax rate is still expected to be about 37% for the full year, given our strong U.S. performance.","Finally, let me touch on one factor that we believe many of you are thinking about, FX rates. At the moment, the U.S. dollar is clearly stronger now than it was a year ago, so we are facing some headwinds when translating our international profits into U.S. dollars.","The impact of translating our international profits at this year's rates compared to last year's rates, was an EPS decrease of less than $0.01 per share in the first quarter, and we expect an impact of about $0.01 again in the second quarter based on current rates.  If these rates hold, the full year effect of the weaker foreign currencies would be a decrease in EPS of about $0.05 per share. However, when we stated on the call in March that our objective is to produce double-digit percentage profit increases in each quarter, we had planned for rates to be about where they are now, so we had factored in that $0.05 full year headwind. If the euro were to fall much below $1.25, of course, these headwinds would grow stronger. This isn't to say we couldn't still achieve our quarterly EPS growth goal, and we will work to offset the FX impact on earnings.","With that financial overview, let me turn the call to Ken so that he can provide you with more color on our first quarter results and address the key trends in our business.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you all participating on our call this morning.","It isn't every quarter that I can say we achieved the highest level of net income and EPS in the history of our business as an athletic company, so let me say thank you to all of our associates who made it happen.  We had a lot of great partners who helped us along the way, most visibly, our excellent brand partners. Results such as this don't happen without outstanding teamwork and excellent performance across the entire company.","We have elevated our financial results, both in absolute terms and in terms of consistency. As John noted, this quarter was the ninth consecutive quarter of meaningful sales and profit increases. We got out of the gate strong in February. We believe we had many strengths as a company, but there's no doubt that our ability to connect with the basketball customer is a huge competitive advantage for us.","The marquee basketball business was outstanding in February, and indeed, throughout the quarter, as key player shoes such as the Lebron, Rose, Kobe and Durant, all sold exceptionally well. Lauren said I'd put color into my remarks, well our vendors put color into these players' shoes and our customers snap them up. In fact, color was a consistent theme throughout all of our categories and we expect it to continue to be so in the future.","The Retro Jordan releases sold out almost immediately, but the Jordan brand was also strong in classics. Results in the Retro training category led by the Griffey and Diamond Turf were also impressive.","Adidas was a very strong performer in our stores and online, and not just with the Rose shoes. We also produced big gains in Adi classics such as the Hardcourt, and originals such as the Samoa.","In the U.S., Converse was a big part of our gain as we successfully rolled out many innovative styles and colors, some of which, like the padded collar Chuck we brought over from Europe. We continued to develop our running assortments with good gains in the Prestige and from some of the technical brands such as ASICS, New Balance, Brooks and Mizuno.","As a category, running was not as strong in the quarter as basketball or the lifestyle classics, with gains in technical and lightweight running somewhat offset by lower sales in some of our longer heritage running programs.","In Europe, our running business got a lift in the middle of the quarter with the introduction of the Nike Free. Initial results are positive and we expect momentum to build over time just as it did in the U.S. The Free gives us another strong platform to build on in Europe, along with shoes like the LA Trainer from Adidas and the Nike Blazer. We recognize that Europe is a challenging situation, but we believe we are well positioned here to maintain our market position for this profitable business.","In the U.S., our buyers successfully predicted the warm march whether by buying in sun a whole lot of slides, which as a category that was definitely a big win for us in the quarter. As Lauren pointed out, our apparel business was strong, especially in North America. The Nike Jordan, Adidas and Under Armour brands led the way with fleece, tees and shorts all doing well. Graphic and verbiage tees from our team edition facility also performed well throughout our banners. The color hookups of the tees and shorts, with the hottest shoes, made for compelling statements to our customers.","We added more performance socks to our assortment, including Nike Elites and Adi and Jordan brand socks. Finally, we extended our lineup of popular Snapback Hats from New Era in order to give our kids the opportunity for great head-to-toe hookups and he really responded favorably.","It all added up to a stellar quarter. But while our store associates and field staff were delivering those results, the rest of us were keeping our focus on the future and executing on the many opportunities to improve and expand our business that we outlined at our investor's meeting in March. We don't have time to update you on everything that we're doing, but I'll touch on some of the key growth areas.","First, we said we would strengthen our apparel business, which you can see from recent results, we're doing. We continue to refine the assortments by banner. We have a stronger performance apparel story in Foot Locker, for example, compared to the lifestyle apparel in Footaction, where we carry items that you won't see in our other banners such as RockSmith tees and Levi's jeans. We also introduced the new Nike NFL apparel in our Champs Sports stores, which we feel very good about going forward.","In Women's apparel, we've rolled out bra and bottoms bars to most of our Lady Foot Locker doors, as well as more performance product. And the response has been good. Of course, it will take some time for customers to discover our new product offerings, and we're not quite ready yet to tell full blown marketing stories about Lady Foot Locker. However, we are making good progress with apparel sales gains in Lady Foot Locker, significantly outpacing footwear, although both were up for the quarter.","Our Kids apparel growth has also been very strong recently, although we're starting from a smaller base. Over time, we believe this will become a more significant part of our business.","Second, and while I'm talking about Kids, we're working to grow our overall Kids business. We have planned several pop-up Kids stores in the back-to-school timeframe, a strategy which worked well for us last year. And we're working on opening Kids stores in select international markets later this year.","Meanwhile, within our existing Kids stores, we continue to roll out kid centric features such as our NBA Pros zone and we're also making the product assortments more kid centric, while still offering the most popular takedowns of the hero shoes from Jordan, Kobe, Rose and others.","Third, we have identified the overall Women's business as an area of exceptional growth potential, and we're working hard to develop the proper long-range formula. Meanwhile, we have the largest chains of Women's athletic stores, Lady Foot Locker, to run on a day-to-day basis, and we've been making progress. I mentioned some of the apparel changes we've made, but we also gained traction in footwear. We produced gains in Nike performance running, driven by in-season TR and Dual Fusion, as well as with the Free, which we launched in 5 colors across the entire chain.","Our technical brands including ASICS and Mizuno, have also done well here, as have the classics from Converse and Adi. We're in the process of coming up with a completely redesigned Lady Foot Locker format, as well as testing altogether, new Women's concept. It's too early to say anything specific about these efforts, other than that the results may take some time to reach their expected full potential. And in the meantime, we'll work hard to make our existing Women's business a stronger contributor to our overall profitability.","Fourth and finally, we identified team sales and services as a significant growth opportunity. Our initial efforts in this area have produced very good results, but again, our existing base is rather small. With the strong support of our vendors, and building on the athletic heritage and infrastructure of Eastbay, we see this business as one that can provide a substantial sales lift over time.","Looking ahead, more broadly, we remain confident about the trends in the athletic business. Customers are continuing to respond favorably to the new technologies and colors across many categories of footwear, apparel and accessories. In addition, we have some external factors working in our favor over the rest of the year.","First, the London Olympics are likely to build consumer awareness of our products, and not just in the U.K. We'll be offering Olympic-themed product in all of our stores around the world. The European championship soccer tournament next month will also provide momentum for our business in Europe.","Second, there's no uncertainty about there being a full NBA season this year. In fact, our challenge is to make sure we build on the initiatives we took over the past year to protect our business in case the NBA didn't play, and not get complacent, given the knowledge that this year, the season will start on time in October. We're not really big on complacency here.","Third, there's also no uncertainty about the NFL season this year. And we have a motivated new vendor, Nike, who's also developing some exciting new products, and we're looking forward to partnering with them, in-store and online, on some of their major initiatives.","Before I get to your questions, I want to acknowledge our board's promotion this week of Dick Johnson to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. We have a strong management team at all levels, but Dick has been one of the key contributors to the success we've had so far in executing our strategic initiatives and elevating our performance to the levels we're seeing today.","I look forward to continuing to work with Dick and the rest of our team to build on the solid base of business we have created, and deliver even greater shareholder returns in the future.","Thank you, and we'll be happy to take your questions now. Go ahead, Sandra.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And the first question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Ken, is this was -- I think this was maybe the first positive quarter for Lady Foot Locker in a few quarters, if memory serves. Is that accurate?","Kenneth C. Hicks","That would be accurate.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And you talked a little bit about a refreshed strategy there when we saw you guys at headquarters in March. Can -- and then we heard a step up in the CapEx about related to Women's. Can you tell us a little bit about the project? At the Analyst Day I guess, we saw a slide with some new Nike fixtures in the Lady Foot Locker and maybe we can hear a little bit more about the details around that.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. With the -- as you know, we did a major study, in looking at the Women's business and the opportunity there, and one of the most important things was that this is apparel driven, not shoe driven. So what we've done is significantly step up the apparel we have in the store. What you're talking about is you saw the bra and bottoms bars that we've placed in the stores, as well as, we've increased other apparel such as shorts, T-shirts, track suits from Adidas and Nike, so there's a heavier sense of apparel. There's also more performance in the stores. We are looking and hopefully, early in the fall season, we will have a new design for the Lady Foot Locker stores that we will test that will allow us to show the apparel even better, but at the same time not lose the strength we have in shoes. And then, finally, as I said, hopefully by the end of this year, we'll be able to put up a store that's really designed from scratch. We'll have a couple of prototypes to test that will allow us to really understand what we can fully do in the Women's business.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. Were you guys able to teach yoga classes in the stores or? I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.","Kenneth C. Hicks","I will not be teaching yoga class in the store.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, so that's been an area, I mean, that's been a chain that's just been a real disappointment for a long time and even since you've been there, it's something that I know you scratch your heads on and gone back to figure it out a few times. But I mean, maybe you can help us just to think directionally. I know you don't like to break down the chains, but directionally, where -- how far below what you think that chain can do on sales per foot or what you've seen historically in sales per foot at the Women's business are we at this point, so we can think about the opportunity?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We don't break out to specific chains, but I will tell you that it performs on all our productivity measures, well below the Men's chains. And quite frankly, based upon some of the competition out there, we see no reason why it couldn't perform at the level of the Men's chains.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then maybe I think you've talked just a little bit about new prototypes that you were testing out at Champs and even the core Foot Locker. Maybe just an update on how that looks...","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we've now extended the prototype that we had for Champs in Tyrone Plaza. And we've got 3 more test stores out there and by the end of the spring, we'll have a total of 10 stores. So we'll be able to test the real economic benefit of that. We're encouraged by what we're seeing with the 3 new ones, so -- and 2 of those, by the way, happen to be new stores. But we will have them around the country and including up into Canada, so that we'll be able to know we'll benefit from this and how fast we should be able to move on it next year.","We've put in a new Foot Locker prototype in Smith Haven Mall in Long Island, and the results of that are encouraging. We're -- as a prototype, we're working out the bugs, and hopefully, we'll be able to roll out test stores and do the same thing that we're doing with the Champs. It's just running about 6 months behind where Champs is. Our approach is come up with the idea, prototype it, work the bugs out of it, test it to understand the financials both in terms of cost to do and the benefit, and then roll out based upon that test, assuming that it's a positive and meets our hurdle guidelines. Rather than just say, here's an idea, let's go out and change the world and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. We're going to make sure the things we do work and have a payback.","Operator","And the next question is from Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just, Ken, just a little more deeper dive in Europe, I guess. Maybe if you added some color, just geographically, I guess, between the 5 major European countries, just kind of where -- what you're seeing north versus south? And just the pickup in the business, I guess where do you see  and you mentioned Nike Free being in place, I guess, it was more on the footwear side than in the apparel side. Just your thoughts for that business Europe as we move to the balance of the year.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, I mean, there's no question Europe's a challenging environment. But to your point, there are differences. I mean, Greece is somewhat of a basket case, and that is a challenge, but we only have a handful of stores there. Across Southern Europe, Portugal, Spain, Italy, it's a little more challenging. And we obviously have a strong position in Italy, but the good news is they were very productive and profitable stores, and they continue to be productive and profitable, even with the business being down a bit.  The Northern Europe, Germany, France, the Benelux countries are performing better, and in fact, in some cases, some of those countries are up and those economies are better. And so, we see kind of a 3-tier business environment, and we're responding to that.","That said, in Shoes, we've got some strong performers. I mean, I mentioned Free, which is a plus for us. The Blazer, some of the Adi classics are doing well. Converse is doing well for us, so they're parts of the business that are doing very, very well. Apparel, which was a bigger business in Europe slowed down a bit. That was partially -- I think, there's going to be a shift, because it's been -- well, we've been warm in the states. It's been very cool in Europe. And as it warms up, I think our apparel, our t-shirts and shorts, will start to pick up there. So, it's not an excuse, it's a timing issue. So, I'm not Pollyanna, I'm not saying things are great in Europe because it is challenging. But it moved, it's in the low single-digit loss for the quarter. It's running up a little bit now. We're forecasting it'll be probably down in the low-single digits for the year, but we do have a lot of things that we're performing well at, and it is a productive chain, or division that delivers. It's interesting, a lot of talk now, when Europe is not performing well and the U.S. is, about Europe bringing us down. There wasn't a lot of talk when Europe was flying and the U.S. was down, and how Europe would bring us up. But our job is to make sure we keep the balance in focus and ride the U.S. strong and make sure we maintain a strong position in Europe.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the apparel side, between private label and branded, you talked a lot about how branded performed. Just a little color on private label and maybe any color between the margin delta between the 2 of them. Did they both improve? Just any thoughts about that.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, our branded business continues to be strong, because of, I tell you, the vendors are coming out with some great product. I mean, Nike, Adidas has been very, very strong, Under Armour. We've been very fortunate. Our private label is improving, and we've got our Women's Actra brand is doing well. We've got Sneaker Freak, which is a strong brand in Europe, that's doing well. But we continue to develop that business as we pulled down on the cotton by the pound T-shirts and move in to more technical apparel, have more fashion in it. And we also, to some degree, have done a shift because with our team edition capability where we're printing shirts for the brands, that used to be -- some of that capacity used to be used with our private label, and is now being done by the brands, so -- or for the brands at a higher ticket. And we're happy and pleased to do that, because it's a fast growing business for us. With regards to margins, we continue to improve the margins. The branded margins are somewhat higher than the private label, but we're continuing to make progress on both fronts.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, real quick, just your thoughts on the running business as we go through the year? Obviously some -- maybe some difficult comparisons, but just probably your thoughts about how you think that could play out and what's in the pipeline?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I think running is really going to continue to be a strong business. There's a lot of newness coming out, the Olympics will help. You've got the PlanetShoes coming out from Nike that will be exciting. Lightweight is really driving the business. And that one of the things that's happened though with that is some of the heavier, older shoes, which with a higher ticket, people have moved to the lightweight technology, and it's a lower ticket. That's put some pressure on the business. That said, we're seeing some great new shoes come out in those, some of those, what I call heritage lines that I think will help spark that business again. So I think running is still a good story for the industry and a particularly good story for us.","Operator","And the next question is from Sam Poser from Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Ken, are you seeing, in Europe, the sort of a shift from -- in the apparel side and in footwear, from sort of more fashion oriented products? We've seen some of the other companies outside of your world come out with more challenging numbers there. Are you seeing that there's sort of a shift more towards athletic because there's just more newness going on in the athletic world than in sort of some of the teen fashion space and so on?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I don't -- I'd think there is more of the technical product that's being sold, because it is more interesting and has more look. You look at some of the colors, for example, on the Frees, they're pretty impressive. So, I think there's more of that. I don't necessarily think it's taking away from the fashion. I just think the customer is more challenged and not able to buy as much as they used to. So I would agree that the technical's going up, because it has more look and fashion. But when -- the Blazers being a good example or some of the Adi shoes, Adidas shoes that we're selling, they still want that fashion. And the Chuck Taylors, doing extremely well, they want that fashion. It's just that I think that they're challenged in how many they can buy or how much they can buy.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess, my question is, I mean, like sort of, some of the teen retails came out with more difficult numbers or one specifically in Europe. Do you think that there's just more innovation, either in fashion or color or technology happening with footwear and then the athletic realm than there is in that other business and it's -- and you're just seeing sort of a shift of one from the other to some extent.","Lauren B. Peters","Away from nonathletic to athletic?","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Away from -- yes, but are they buying less jeans and are they buying more sneakers and other stuff?","Kenneth C. Hicks","No. I don't -- I think, like I said, I think that's -- on the margins, that's what's happening. I think the bigger issue is that you've got -- in Spain for example, over 25% unemployment overall. And with the youth, it's almost -- if you're under the age of 25, you're not working. And that's tough, how can I keep buying more?  I can't buy my stuff every couple of weeks. Now maybe it's every 3 weeks or once a month. So that's, I think -- well, on the margin, some of them are buying some of the technical shoes. The fashion is just not moving as much because they're challenged. And the best example, I think, to illustrate that is while we're selling Free, nicely or very nicely North. And we're selling it well in the South where fashion is more important in places like Italy and Spain. It's good, but not as great as it is where fashion isn't as important.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then secondly, as you look ahead at what's being offered, I would assume you're just about to -- you're sort of locked down through the holiday. I'm not sure if you pre-lined spring yet. But as you see the offerings coming from various people, how does that look in both in footwear and apparel? And secondly, on -- when you talk about apparel, you talked -- you mentioned Under Armour. Are you seeing -- is Under Armour helping in the Women's area? Are they stepping up with you in a different way at Lady Foot? Is that -- is something going on there?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, we're working with Under Armour. They've got a major effort in Women's and as do all of our vendors, quite frankly. And they're working with us very closely. We've got a good relationship with them. And they realize that to be successful in the mall, we need to work together, and we are on the apparel front and on the shoe front. That said, from all the vendors looking forward this fall, as I said, we've got the World Cup, we've got the Olympics, we've got a full season of football, a full season of basketball and we've got some great names out there that are all exciting. I mean, you got Lebron and Wade and Rose and Durant's just hotter than a pistol, both on and off the court, that -- this is an exciting time for us.","Operator","And the next question is from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Lauren, you said something you've just seen that caught my attention, when you spoke about apparel margins relative to footwear and that footwear margins were actually still increasing and did increase in the quarter. I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color around that? I would've thought that footwear margins were nearing peak if not there already. So it's a nice surprise to see that those continue to increase.","Lauren B. Peters","Yes, we think the same, good to see that they're increasing. So, we've talked about it before, apparel margins is still below footwear margins. And we did narrow the GAAP though in the quarter, so although footwear margins improved, apparel margins improved year-over-year relatively more. But we still are at that case where footwear is higher than apparel, which encourages us that as we develop that apparel business that, that will help margins.","Kenneth C. Hicks","And what's -- one of the things that's happening that's helping the footwear margins, it's because we're -- 2 things, one, we obviously -- cost went up, and as a result, we adjusted pricing and the customers accepted those prices, because we work very closely with the vendors on where it made sense and where it didn't. And the second thing is a lot of the flow programs that...","Lauren B. Peters","They're really paying off.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Lauren really led that effort on are paying off because we're able to have more full price sales on all of our product.","Lauren B. Peters","As we improved that flow, it keeps the product fresher and supports more full price selling.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So is there -- is it safe to assume that there's still more runway on the footwear margins out on the business?","Lauren B. Peters","Well, we're going to keep working on the flow initiative.","Kenneth C. Hicks","And the brands are, too. As, I think as Lauren said in her remarks, we're going to be a little more -- we're not as -- we'll be a little more conservative as we go through the year. But as we keep working on them, we keep finding new opportunities.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","All right, then. I think we can all appreciate the conservatism. But just to be clear, there isn't anything that should materially change from the product flow opportunity perspective. And obviously, price increases are going to continue to come through the pike in future quarters, correct?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. But one thing that I'd say is we do continue to say that -- look for it to be 30 to 40 basis points. You get the leverage out of the occupancy, the fixed cost. But those product margins we'll keep working on flow. But as we talked about last year, and we still see it this year, our IMU, the difference between retail price at its origin MSRP and the cost we pay, that's narrowed. So we've got some pressure on margins there, but again, we keep working on the flow stuff to help us.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Got it. Understood. And then would you care to comment on what that gap between apparel and footwear margins has narrowed to? Is that gap now in tens of basis points? Or is it still hundreds of basis points? Any sort of broad quantification would be appreciated.","Lauren B. Peters","No. I understand. It's still a meaningful gap, but that we've -- gives us opportunity.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just going back to Europe, if can because I think it's an interesting and important topic here, clearly on everyone's mind. It sounds like the demand in your European business really was a function of having more of the better product, less so macro constraints or is that kind of a fair assessment there? It's as you got more free product during the middle of the quarter then you started to see those comps improve? Is that how we should think of that going forward?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, no. I wish we could overcome the macro world, but we can't. But that said, it is a product, it's not -- as Sam talked about and I talked about, it doesn't take away a lot of the sales that we had going on, so it's additive.  And so as we expand our efforts with things like Free, it's additive to what we're doing.","Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And maybe since you've opened up new stores on the continent, I think these were more Eastern European stores, if you could just talk about the performance of those new store openings in Europe that would be helpful too.","Kenneth C. Hicks","We're pleased with the new stores that we've opened in those countries to the point that we're continuing to open stores in Poland and the Czech Republic.","Operator","And the next question is from Steve Glagola from Barclays.","Stephen Glagola - Barclays Capital, Research Division","With regards to the European football championships and the Olympics, do you guys have any initiatives planned to highlight these events? And just -- how do you expect this to impact the SG&A over the next couple of quarters?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we'd obviously, we don't sell pure Olympic, like -- well, we do in Eastbay, but where we will get our benefit is twofold. We have a fair bit of apparel that we'll be selling, ranging from T-shirts to very high priced leather jackets that we'll be selling in our stores. And so we will have -- that will provide a benefit and provide interest. We've got some great looking product that we've seen from Adidas and Nike. There will also be product like shoes that will look like some of the shoes that some of the athletes will be wearing, and we will have those. The second, and probably the bigger and longer-term impact that we've always seen from things like the Euro Cup and the Olympics, are people just want to be more fit. They feel inspired and more people go out and take up running or playing basketball with the anniversary, 20th anniversary of the Dream Team, there's going to be tremendous excitement about that, both in terms of product but also, in terms of people saying well, those guys are still up running around, I probably can too. And the third thing is some of the technology. We've talked about the Flywire. There's also new technology that will be going in the shoes that Lebron will be wearing that will -- I actually tested and did not do as well as Lebron did that showed you how high you could jump or how fast you can move, and people will be able to track that. And that technology, I think, from Nike, will be able to -- that people will see and will use and it will be an ongoing thing. So you have -- the product that goes with Olympics. You've got just the aura around the Olympics, and then the technology that will come out of the Olympics that will all encourage sales.","Stephen Glagola - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, also just lastly in terms of the comp for the quarter, I don't know if you mentioned, just the split of AUR versus units, and just kind of how you expect that to trend over the remainder of the year?","Kenneth C. Hicks","We did not. And we don't give the specifics, but  we had -- well, actually all of the measures were up. Traffic was up. The conversion was up and AUR was up.","Operator","And the next question is from Kate McShane from Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you can add some detail, another question on Europe but just to kind of fully understand exactly what's going on in the environment. I just wondered what the competitive environment is like there currently? And how healthy are some of your competitors? And if that potentially is an opportunity over the next 6 months to 12 months?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, one of the things, and we stayed pretty close through both our own organization and monitoring the industry, it's challenging for some of our less well-financed competitors, and we've seen a number of them that have gone away. And I think more will have challenges, and that will provide an opportunity for us. We were able -- for example, we just recently -- somebody was going away, and we've picked up 6 leases, in the Czech Republic and Poland, that allowed us to enter those countries in a better way because they were getting out of the business. In Europe, remember, there are still a lot more very small chains and that provides opportunity for us, as we look both in terms of competition falling out and potential places to go.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And my second question is about ASPs. And I know it's a little bit early to be thinking about 2013. But I wondered if you had any view that as we get into the end of the year, where we could see ASPs going. Do you have the sense that vendors are going to continue to increase prices or do you think 2012 was the year to increase prices as the inflationary pressures and then we'll see the more normalized environment at the end of the year and starting in 2013?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I think that 2012 was a higher-than-normal year. And there will still be some pressures, because not so much because of raw materials but because of labor prices in some of the markets. We will see some price increases. They'll probably be more modest. They'll probably be much more targeted, but I don't think we'll see what we saw in 2012, and I don't see them going down.","Operator","And the next question is from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just -- first question, just looking at the digital business, could you -- if you exclude Eastbay, what is the growth that you're seeing in the rest of your Direct-to-Customers business? And also, where are we on launching the websites in the various European countries?","Kenneth C. Hicks","For the non-Eastbay websites, we're in the -- and it varies by site, whether it's Foot Locker, Champs, Kids Foot Locker, whatever, we're up in the 30% to 40% range. So we're seeing very significant good growth. They are, from my perspective, we're still under penetrated, but we've got a significant effort between the stores and the websites to make sure that we continue to grow there and really drive a much more coordinated business. Our web business versus our competition is a much larger business. We've got a longer heritage and we feel very good about it as we go forward. In Europe, we have -- we've had a website in the U.K. We rolled out in the Benelux, in France, Germany, and we're working on doing some of the southern countries. Hopefully, we'll have another country or 2 to add by the end of the year and some more in the spring of next year, so we continue to roll that effort out.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great, that's helpful. Also expense management was very impressive this quarter. Could you just give a little bit more detail in terms of which areas you saw the most leverage, whether it was store payroll or marketing, corporate expenses? And also, just is there anything timing related that will kind of alter the pace of the year-over-year expense growth in the coming quarters? Perhaps, second quarter versus second half. Should we expect the low single-digit increase in expenses to continue?","Lauren B. Peters","Yes. Again, I'd reiterate that what you would expect for the balance of the year is 60 to 80 basis points per quarter. With the spending $8 million more than a year ago, the improvement in SG&A was across the board. We really were very, very thoughtful in where we had increases. And as we've said, marketing was one of the places that we've looked to continue to tell our story.","Operator","And the next question is from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-ups. The first, the flying Nate in the Nike Plus be boss sneaker being launched at the Olympics, are you expecting significant quantities of those shoes? Is this a big push that we could see in July, August? Or should we think more of it being seeded into the market and those could be more drivers to your business in 2013?","Kenneth C. Hicks","I'm thinking the whole markets, they are -- safe to say they're being seeded. This is something -- Nike's a very thoughtful company of how it manages new products and technologies. They're going to get it out there. We will have it in a number of our best running stores and on Eastbay and online. And we think it will be good or very good to start, and we look forward to working with them. But the real push will be as it becomes, as the other new technologies have, more of taken in to the market, and I think in 2013, it will be a big play.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then the second question, I don't know if you'll give us a lot of insight into this, any new apparel programs for fall? Any new brands coming in? Anything that you weren't doing last fall or that you're not doing right now, in the spring that we should be excited about?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, probably one of the biggest things is our team addition program. That's really helped us with the T-shirts and we've expanded that with each of the major brands. We were able to test the T-shirt. We can put out 20 different styles, see -- get 120 in some stores, see which ones work and then come back within 4 or 5 weeks with several thousand of the ones that worked. So that's one of the biggest plays. But I think the other thing is each of the vendors has stepped up their technology and what they're doing when you look at what Under Armour brought out last fall. You look at what Nike's doing. You look at what all of them are doing in women. And we continue to work with Adidas on their programs. So it's not that it's a revolutionary technology, it's that they upped their game with the programs that they have significantly.","Operator","And the next question is from Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Ken, maybe talk about the sort of mixed shift, if you will -- or I'm sort of curious on the assortment basketball versus running. Clearly, the cycle has been driven primarily by the lightweight running category. But now, we've seen sort of the re-acceleration in basketball. When you first came on board, you sort of talked about deemphasizing basketball a bit. Maybe just again speak to the ability across the banners to flex the assortments, basketball relative to running and what you're seeing on the trends?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, I never wanted to deemphasize basketball. I just want to emphasize running more. But what happened was there's a lot of technology and a lot of new things going on in running and we still continue to see. I'm looking down at John's feet now I'm seeing some of the new shoes that he's got on. So that helped to drive that business and lightweight was a big part of that. And basketball, quite frankly, not a lot of newness has happened. Well, I would say, there's 3 things that now have happened to basketball that have really stepped it up. One is there's some new technologies and things, lightweight has become more important. Ankle support has become more important. So you see different things that the brands are doing to help drive that. Second is that the players have expanded and have all performed well and stayed out of trouble, and it's really helped the business. When you look -- it's not just -- okay, there's Michael Jordan or it's not that there's just Lebron. You've got Lebron, you've got Kobe, you've got Rose. You've got Durant, you've got Wade. And all of them are performing -- and there's more than that. They're all performing well. And the third thing, I think, that's happened is the look has really gotten good. They've really worked hard to improve the look there. So between technology, the players and the look, that helped the basketball. And so what's really happened is that the basketball business has come back. Our ability to flex quite frankly is significant because of the markets we're in and the different banners. So you've got a banner like Footaction that is much more basketball driven, and we can -- they benefit more from what's happening in basketball whereas Foot Locker has a tendency to be more balanced. And they can have a shift on what goes back and forth. But we can up our level of play in whichever one's working and still be true to what each of the banner stands for.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then maybe just to follow on that from a pricing perspective, we obviously know the vendors are putting through these price increases relatively broadly. But it sounds like from a mixed perspective, the running category, as lightweight sort of increases, you say ASP's actually a little bit down relative to the heritage. Can you maybe just speak to where the sort of targeted price increases are really coming? Is it within the basketball category? Is it just select within running? And then how do we think about this sort of puts and takes from a pricing perspective?","Kenneth C. Hicks","It's in all of the categories. And what's happening is, as they come out with new technology, they're able take the pricing up. The launched shoes. Some of the prices, we're selling shoes about $225-$250. But at the same time, we've got a Durant shoe, they're $110-$120. So we're able to have a range of prices. But I think, what the vendors have done very well is they brought out new technology, which has allowed us to take the price up but give the customer a tremendous value. So it ain't -- it may even be from the same family. It may be Lunar or Free, but they've added things to it to be able to get $5 or $10 more. And some of the more technical running brands like ASICS [indiscernible] Gel or Mizuno, those have been able to maintain strong selling even with the lightweight at some pretty good prices.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if we can just lastly, switching gears a bit but to the real estate side. I understand you're layering growth in Europe. But domestically, maybe you sort of speak to the environment, your discussions and negotiations with landlords, how those fair? Obviously, in some -- given your productivity levels are doing quite well. So just in terms of that, relative to still finding some of the more unprofitable doors that you could continue in vet? And how much of that still could potentially be a lever to pull on the margin side as well?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we're still working with what we call our lost stores, and there are opportunities there. And we won't know -- because most of the negotiations really don't get hot and heavy until the latter part of the year. But some landlords gives us concessions, some don't and some malls just aren't performing, so we get out of them. But we continue to work, and I will tell you that it is still a lever. You've heard we've closed a number of stores in the first quarter, we will continue, if a store does not make it and it's not strategically important, we will not -- we'll pull out of that store. That said, we are opening other stores. We're opening Foot Lockers, we're opening Kids, and we're opening Champs stores. Champs you've heard it's performing well. It's one of our smaller number, and there are a number of malls that don't have Champs in it.","Operator","And the next question is from Bernard Sosnick from Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","With regard to Champs doing so well, running ahead of the other banners, could you give us a clue as to qualitatively, what is the difference between Champs and where the other banners are? And how quickly you think the gap may narrow?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, Champs was the banner that we really started with, defining and clarifying the banners. And it's about 6 to 8 months ahead of the other banners and with regard to that. And they benefited from that. They've also benefited in the apparel that we've pushed -- we've pushed the apparel business, and I think straightened that out sooner so the clear banner definition that -- the use of apparel. And then the third thing is we started stepping up their marketing first. So we were pushing their marketing faster. So they're 6 to 8 months ahead of the other banners. And remember, one of the things that we did, Jake, was part of the team -- Jake Jacobs was part of the team and we helped set that up and we've moved him now back up here and he's, taking some of those same lessons he learned down in Champs and applying them to BigFoot.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","So you're feeling is that the others are on track, similar to Champs?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes. We think a lot of the changes and things now, I wouldn't sit here and say we're going to see a 20% increase from them. But I think that a lot of the changes and things that Champs did to put themselves in the position, we can continue -- we are doing and we'll see in Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and Footaction.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. Now another question, you're a very important distribution channel for Nike, no question about it. What are your thoughts about Nike opening apparel shops at Penney, assuming that shops like that would be at least 500 feet, maybe to 1,000 more space than a specialty apparel, a specialty footwear retailer can allocate to apparel.","Kenneth C. Hicks","I don't know if Penney's might have been pretty mature exactly in defining what that is. I obviously can't talk about what Nike does or doesn't do with Penney's. But right now, Penney's does sell Nike apparel and it's a different level. And so we don't -- I'm not as concerned about that level, because ours is higher quality and more look than what they have. I also would say that when other people have opened in the mall, for the most part, that actually helps us because it drives -- people get the idea but they drive, because of our assortment, it drives them more to us. So I'm obviously not excited about somebody opening up a bunch of outlets. But I think that our merchants and our position in the market with Nike will allow us to be well positioned and to be able to beat somebody who's that's not their forte.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Well, I have to tell you this, so you've set a standard and I'm going to hold you to it. Record earnings quarter-after-quarter.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Well, we appreciate it, Bernie. We're going to try.","Operator","And we have Taposh Bari from Jefferies Online.","Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right, so Ken, it sounds like the underlying trends in basketball and running are both pretty robust and have been for at least 2 years now. So I guess the question for you guys is do you feel like Foot Locker and the other brands within your portfolio have a more competitive or greater kind of structural competitive advantage in basketball, based on what seems to be more exclusivity in some of these marquee styles that you're speaking to? Because it sounds like pretty much everyone out there is selling and doing well in lightweight running. I just want a take on your thoughts on that.","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, I think because of our position in the industry, and with the customer, we are better positioned with basketball. We have the benefit of being a strong player with exclusives. We probably have the best assortment of basketball from Nike, Adidas, Under Armour and Reebok. And I think that, that allows us to be the place to go when somebody wants some basketball shoe, both for performance and for look. So basketball's a little different than running, and I think you said it that it's not just one thing in running and it's not just one vendor or and it's not as player driven, whereas basketball is much more driven by those things, and we're well positioned in basketball. That said, I feel very good about our position in running. And I'd like to have more, I'd like to have more of both. But I think we can have more in basketball -- or I'm sorry in running because of our penetration.","Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Just the other question that I had was on a point about running. You spoke to a little bit of a mixed shift away from traditional to lightweight. Is that a phenomenon that really accelerated this past quarter? Because I would have thought that, that would have been ongoing now for a while. And I guess in addressing that move, is there a way that you can tweak your merchandise strategy to better capture that underlying trend?","Kenneth C. Hicks","Yes, I think there's 2 elements. one is to make sure that we're best positioned in lightweight. But second, in some of the more heritage programs, or more technical programs, by stepping up what we have with technical, when you look at what we're doing with people like ASICS, Mizuno, Brooks, softening, that helps. But also, with Nike, we can step up our efforts in technical with Nike, and improve. And I know that each of the vendors is working hard to take some of those heritage programs to make them even stronger.","John A. Maurer","Thank you for your participation in our call today. That's all we have time for. But we look forward to having you join us on our next call, which we anticipate will take place at 9 a.m. on Friday, August 17 following the release of our second quarter and year-to-date earnings earlier that morning.

As reported in this morning's press release, the company reported net income of $172 million in the first quarter, driven by a 4.6% comparable sales gain and an improved gross margin rates. This compares to net income of $165 million in the first quarter of last year. Earnings per share came in that $1.52 compared to $1.38 per share in the first quarter of 2018. Included in this year's results is an incremental $1 million charge related to the pension matter that we have spoken about in the past. Last year the results included a $12 million charge related to the same matter. Excluding these items on a non-GAAP basis first quarter earnings were $1.53 per share, a 6% increase compared to $1.45 last year. ","Unless otherwise noted the figures and rates mentioned during our call today will be based on non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in this morning's press release. We will begin our prepared remarks with Lauren Peters, Foot Locker's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will provide details on our first quarter financial results along with our financial outlook for the balance of the year. Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the key drivers of our first quarter performance, then provide an update on the progress against our long-term strategic imperatives as well as some color around what we see as the current year progresses. Lauren.","Lauren Peters","Thank you Jim. Good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us today. 2019 has gotten off to a solid start. Led by the mid single-digit comparable sales gain, the top line came in where we expected and it reflects the ongoing work by our team to build even stronger connections with our customers. Reviewing the results in detail, comparable sales increased 4.6% and overall sales rose 2.6% including the impact of weaker foreign currencies compared to a year ago which reduced sales by $42 million. ","On a constant currency basis total sales increased 4.7% with gains in all of our regions and channels. By month February comparable sales were up mid single-digits. March was also up mid single-digits despite the impact from the shift of Easter into April. April benefited from the shift and was up high single-digit. Breaking out our comparable sales gains by channel our stores were up 2.9% while our direct to customer channel led our performance with a 14.8% sales increase. As a percent of total sales DTC rose to 15.4% for the quarter up from 13.9% last year reflecting our recent investments and initiatives to drive growth in this area. Store traffic was down low single-digits overall while conversion improved. Our digital touch points led by mobile saw overall traffic growth.","The drivers of the sales performance in the quarter were broad based. In North America Champs Sports led the way with a low double-digit comp gain. Foot Locker U.S. and Foot Locker Canada were each up mid single-digits and Eastbay posted a low single-digit gain. Internationally all of our divisions posted comparable sales gains. Foot Locker Pacific had the strongest performance with comparable sales up double-digits. Foot Locker Europe produced a mid single-digit increase, its third consecutive quarter with a comp gain. Runners Point and Sidestep returned to growth each posting low single-digit comp gain. On the other side of the ledger Kids Foot Locker posted a low single-digit comp decline due in part to limited quantities of high demand apparel. Footaction was down high single-digits due to softer demand in their mens footwear business","Turning to the families of business footwear was the strongest category with mid single-digit comp gains while apparel was up low single-digits. In our accessories business fashion bags were strong but that impact was offset by declines in socks and hats leading to a double-digit decline. Within footwear our women's business had an excellent result during the quarter posting a low double-digit increase. Children's footwear was up high single-digits and men's increased mid single-digits. Average selling prices in footwear were flat in the quarter while units were up high single-digits.","By category men's classics posted strong double-digit gains and men's running was up high single-digits. Trends in men's basketball improved during the quarter with comp sales down slightly. Overall drivers were broad based with gains in Nike, Puma, Adidas, Fila, Vans, and offerings from Jordan. In a few minutes Dick will provide additional color on some of the quarter's exciting concepts and collaborations.","Turning to apparel I mentioned we were up low single-digits for the quarter. This was led by our men's business which grew mid single-digits while women's was down low single-digits and children's decreased low double-digits. Average selling prices in apparel were up high single-digits in the quarter, while units were down mid single-digit which reflects our focus on a more premium apparel strategy. Overall branded assortments continued to drive the business with gains in Tees and fleece from Nike, Champion, Jordan, and Fila. Our men's shorts business also picked up led by assortments from Nike and Champion.","Turning now to margins, as we laid out at our recent Investor Day to build upon our customer connections we have and continue to make strategic investments in our company's digital capabilities, store fleet, and infrastructure. Even as we do this we are focused on operating the business efficiently and effectively to improve the bottom line. In the first quarter we were able to lever on a mid single-digit comp gains to improve our gross margin by 30 basis points to 33.2% of sales from 32.9% a year ago. Our merchandised margin rate decreased 20 basis points while leverage of our relatively fixed occupancy and buyer's compensation expenses gave us 50 basis points of improvement. The merchandised margin was impacted by the higher mix of DTC which incurs higher freight expense. ","Our SG&A rate in the quarter increased to 20% of sales from 19% in the same period a year ago. The higher expense was largely due to the investments we're making in our digital capabilities and infrastructure as well as pressures related to a higher minimum wages. Another contributing factor during the first quarter last year SG&A included a onetime benefit of approximately $5 million from insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Maria. Depreciation expense decreased to $44 million from $45 million in the prior year. Interest income increased to $4 million from $2 million last year due to the higher interest rates on our cash balances. Our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 26.4% below last year's Q1 rate and better than expected due primarily to an adjustment to a foreign tax credit valuation allowance.","Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1,126 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $97 million from the end of Q1 last year. During the first quarter we repurchased approximately 32,000 shares for $1.8 million. While repurchase activity was limited in the first quarter during which we laid out our new strategic plan, we do intend to continue to implement and our previously announced $1.2 billion share repurchase program when appropriate. Execution of the program is of course subject to various strategic, financial, and legal parameters which may vary from time to time. That being said we paid out $43 million were recently increased $0.38 quarterly dividend which represents a 10% increase over the previous dividend rate.","In terms of capital expenditures we invested approximately $45 million into our business during the quarter consistent with the objectives we outlined in March. This funded the opening of 14 new stores including two power stores and our sixth store in Asia as well as the remodeling or relocating of 13 stores. We also closed 34 stores leaving us with 3,201 company owned stores at the end of the quarter.","Our inventory continued to be well positioned at the end of April with a year-over-year increase of just 0.1% compared to our 2.6% reported sales increase. On a constant currency basis inventory increased 1.7% compared to the 4.7% currency neutral total sales growth. Our inventory remains fresh and productive and we are well positioned to continue flowing new product in Q2.","Turning now to our financial outlook for the remainder of 2019. For the second quarter which as a reminder is typically the lowest volume quarter of the year with no big call to action shopping events, we now expect a low to mid single-digit comp gain. The gross margin is likely to be flat to down 20 basis points. For the full year we continue to expect to deliver in mid single-digit comp gains with 20 to 40 basis points of gross margin improvement. On the SG&A front we expect the expense rate to increase 80 to 100 basis points in the second quarter with an expected improvement in SG&A deleverage through the back half of 2019 as I noted during our Investor Day. For the full year we expect to delever SG&A by 40 to 60 basis points, on track with our previous guidance.","Finally we still expect depreciation to be approximately $185 million and our full year effective tax rates to be about 27.5%. All that being said the slower pace of share repurchase activity so far is putting pressure on our EPS growth rate and we now expect full year earnings per share to increase high single-digit. I am going to now turn the call over to Dick to provide you additional insight into our first quarter performance and how we're doing in executing against our updated strategic imperatives.","Richard Johnson","Thanks Laure and good morning everyone. We kicked off the year with tremendous energy starting with big events like the NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte, the opening of two more power stores, initial launch of our new FLX membership program, ongoing expansion in Asia, exciting new product concepts and storytelling, and the release of our strategic imperatives and updated financial objectives at our recent Investor Day. Even with all of that happening we remain focused on execution to produce a solid top line results in the first quarter with comparable sales up mid single-digits. ","This encouraging performance reached across regions, most banners in our men's, women's, and kids businesses. To continue this momentum we are managing the business with our four key strategic imperatives in mind. First, elevating the customer experience; second, investing for long-term growth; third, driving productivity, and fourth, leveraging the power of our people.","Let's start by reviewing some of our efforts to elevate the customer experience through the lens of our customer connected framework RF5C [ph]. First, our team did an excellent job this quarter leveraging our strong vendor partnerships and the internal talent to deliver compelling and unique concepts and collections. With Nike the next generations of our exclusive home and away platform were released in Dallas, Seattle, and Philadelphia. This release celebrated what makes those cities great.","To have a Nike day collection was a customer highlight, a great lead into Air Max. While the Jordan Nostalgia Pack included footwear and apparel assortments that connected today's customers to the brand's history. With Adidas we partnered on the launch of two collaborations connected to youth culture. The Game of Thrones ultra boost collection leveraged the excitement of the show's final season while the Adidas Marvel collections celebrated the release of the latest Avengers movie, one of the top grossing movies of all time and included 2 AM styles made specifically through the SPEEDFACTORY partnership. Champ Sports aligned with Fila and Nickelodeon to channel 1990s nostalgia with an exclusive Rug Rats collection. And with Vans we collaborated on it's Off The Waffles collection which was created with a popular restaurant Sweet Chick and launched exclusively with us. At the release party we organized a surprise performance by musicians Nas and Ray Kwan [ph] delighting the lucky customers in attendance.","But offering exciting products is not enough, we need great content to connect with our customers through compelling storytelling. To accomplish this during the quarter we used multiple channels to build excitement around the premium special products offered across our banners. In March we launched the Discover Your Air Network with cable inspired programming for the ultimate sneaker head in the Air Max fans across all ages. The network featured shows including the animated The Air Pair fitness show and Airobics and sitcom Air It Out. This programming was led by an impressive lineup of talented influencers across the style, pop culture, comedy, art, and sports. Our customers were able to access this content through Foot Lockers Instagram, Facebook, Snap Chat, and You Tube channels.","To celebrate the impact of women in sneaker culture we put our own twist on Women's History Month with a special celebration called Women's Kickstory month. Throughout the month we held a series of events including women centric workshops, panel discussions with New York City based women in speaker culture, and our first ever Kickstory Museum featuring sneakers made for women or by women. During fashion week in Europe Foot Locker partnered with female influencers from the You Tube collective Neva in their search for the hottest styles captured in three Instagram takeovers from Paris, London, and Milan. ","As part of the International Women's Day we teamed up with five female creators and provided them with a platform to showcase their product or youth culture related artwork on our social media channels, in-store, and in our Foot Locker Europe websites. Another key focus for us is building community. We are doing this by developing innovative local experiences to tap into our customer's interests and passion. At this year's NBA All-Star Weekend in Charlotte our mobile House of Hoops courtside concept brought an action packed lineup of Foot Locker events. Not only did we bring great product but NBA fans and sneaker heads alike got access to workshops with their favorite players including Jayson Tatum, Ben Simmons, and Kyrie Irving. In addition Russell Westbrook and Paul George served on a panel and engaged with young fans regarding sneaker designs.","Highlighting our global skill this year we brought the excitement of NBA All-Star weekend to Australia. Our Foot Locker Pacific team brought a House of Hoops truck to iconic Federation Square in the heart of Melbourne loaded with limited edition sneakers and jerseys. While customers also participated in the three point contest and watched games and highlights. Back in the U.S. Eastbay presented the 89th AAU James E. Sullivan Award to Stanford volleyball player Kathryn Plummer at the New York Athletic Club. The award is presented annually to the most outstanding amateur athlete in the U.S.","In February Champ Sports and Eastbay joined with New Balance and MLB star Francisco Lindor in a pre-season visit to Puerto Rico. While there he surprised 400 kids at the opening of a baseball field and a local youth park that had been damaged severely by Hurricane Maria. He then made a store appearance and met with fans during the launch of the New Balance 997H. These are all great examples of how we are partnering with brands, local businesses, and influencers that serve their communities. They also reflect how our customers connect with us through our stores, digital channels, social media, and nomadic retail. ","We are continuing to build this connectivity and leverage the data we give through our wide range of touch points in order to provide our customers with even more exciting avenues to engage with us. One of the biggest near term opportunities for us to leverage this data is the rollout of FLX our new membership program. FLX motivates our customer to stay within the Foot Locker portfolio of banners by offering exciting and relevant experiences and benefits. This program is now live at Lady Foot Locker in the U.S. and Foot Locker Netherlands with an expanded role out expected later in 2019.","We are also working to make the retail customer experience more convenient while continuing to deliver on ever evolving customer expectations. In Europe we rolled out our launch reservation app in our first two markets. The app creates a more seamless and convenient customer experience during hot product launches removing the need for our customers to stand in line for hours and freeing up our associates to be more productive.","Turning to our second strategic imperative, investing for long-term growth we are focusing on opportunities that drive connections with our customers, give us new capabilities, and expand our geographic reach. During the quarter we opened our third North American power store in Philadelphia. We also opened a power store in Milan but our first on the European continent. All stores are designed to connect with and celebrate their local communities with special activation spaces, localized product, dedicated women's and kids' spaces, and more. We still expect to open more than a dozen power stores in 2019 with additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, Frankfurt, and Melbourne.","We also continued our expansion in Asia with the opening of our store in Singapore's Jewel Mall at Changi Airport. The store is our fourth in Singapore and has two floors with full family shopping and designated men's, women's, and kids areas. For the remainder of 2019 we are on track to open 15 stores in Asia.","Moving on to our third strategic imperative, driving productivity we're focused on this at every level of our company. Effective inventory management is one of the key levers we have to drive productivity across our portfolio. With that in mind we are currently rolling out RFID technology in our Foot Locker Europe stores. We believe this technology has the potential to improve our operations and overall customer experience in a number of ways. First more accurate inventory tracking can drive sales growth by providing associates and customers the ability to find every piece of merchandise down to the last unit available whether it's for an in-store customer or an online order. Second, it has the potential to free our associates to focus more on serving our customers and less on organizing back rooms and restocking floor inventory. And third RFID can help limit theft and make the audit process faster and more efficient.","Another key area of investment to drive productivity has been the rollout of our new point of sale software solution. It's been installed in nearly all of our U.S. store. We are now focused on making significant progress across our international markets with approximately 40% of our European stores already live. This new solution gives us additional capabilities to better serve our customers including data capture, FLX enrolment and redemption, email receipts, and improved order tracking which brings me to our fourth strategic imperative, to leverage the power of our people. ","In order to drive productivity, invest for long-term growth, and elevate the customer experience we are tapping the expertise and talents across our global workforce. Our associates are on the front lines making sure that our customers have a great experience no matter where or how they interact with us. They're the key to making sure that the new systems are effective and installed in a timely manner. The customer events and footwear launches are successful and that our customers leave our stores happy and looking forward to returning soon. We continue to invest in the development of our associates and reap their collective insights to do what we do, better.","As we look to the rest of 2019 we are optimistic. The product pipeline is compelling with new concepts and collaborations coming soon. For example this includes the Nike summer blockbuster platform featuring lifestyle shoes that tell the story of NBA stars Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, and De'Aaron Fox as well as the release of the new Gianna signature shoe. New iterations of the printed and unwanted transept with Adidas as well as limited run releases through our partnership with their speed factory. With Champion we recently announced our new e-gaming collaboration, we are looking forward to a number of other initiatives with them over the next few months. And lastly we see an ongoing opportunity in brand Jordan during the year led by great product, great storytelling, and an exclusive concept.","Before we open the call for your questions, I want to take a moment to thank all of our associates for the passion they bring to the business. With their hard work and dedication combined with the focus on achieving our four strategic imperatives we are providing great experiences for our customers and building and delivering value for our shareholders. Operator we're now ready to start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Jonathan Komp from Baird is online with a question.","Jonathan Komp","First Lauren just to clarify, I know you said sales in the quarter were pretty close to what you expected. Can you comment on margin performance, gross margin, and then the level of investment within G&A, how that ended up versus what you originally had expected, any areas of variance that you saw?","Lauren Peters","Well, again our margin performance we improved 30 basis points with 50 basis points of leverage on our fixed cost merch margins affected by the strength in DTC and that increases as a rate of penetration that's one of the dynamics. Of course those sales carry a higher freight but again we remain agnostic about how that customer shops across the channels because the finish margins allow us to be agnostic in that regard. SG&A we had several components in it as we described in Investor Day, bit more challenge there on the front half versus the back half, the big elements within SG&A on the delever are the technology investments but as we described that's yielding benefits to the business in the near-term and in the long-term but in the near-term seeing some leverage on that. So that was the biggest element there. We have the ongoing increases in minimum wage so we're very focused on our productivity improvements to minimize our expense on the back side of the house and maximize the effectiveness on the customer experience. And then the third element is the marketing, so we have many initiatives around that marketing and it is a bit variable with the DTC so you have strength on that. You see the marketing dollars fill up.","But with our data technology and FLX opportunities we're seeing the ability for that marketing to become ever more effective that we will get ever more able to see how that dollar of marketing drives a dollar of sales and margin. So those are the big elements that work there and again I would reiterate more pressure is on the front half than what we see coming in the back half. ","Richard Johnson","But Jonathan I would add that they were generally in line with our plan just like sales were to mid single-digit comp and the improvement in margin and the deleverage on SG&A were generally in line with what we expected.","Jonathan Komp","Okay great and then maybe as a follow up my bigger question on the outlook for the year, I know you adjusted the earnings based on the share repurchase assumptions. I guess when you look at what's needed is that the new range especially in the back half of better sales against pretty tough comparisons on the surface and then better margin flow through, like how much of that is based on expectations for better mall traffic trends in general versus how much do you specifically have line of sight to whether it's product launches or all the initiatives that you highlighted?","Richard Johnson","At this point Jonathan we've got a pretty good line of sight in terms of deliveries and launches and where product has shifted and moved that may be different from our original plan. But we've got good line of sight in the back half so we believe the things that I listed in my comments we've got a lot of great heat coming with our great vendor partners and we know that when there is heat in the stores and online the consumers find us and as Lauren mentioned in her comments the second quarter is just sort of a not a very exciting period in retail but when you get into the third quarter you get into the heat of a back to school and back to sports for our banners and then you get into the holiday season. So certainly we're up against tougher comps. But we've got a good line of sight to the product and the flow of product at this point and we are confident about the guidance that we've given. ","Lauren Peters","And we talked about it a bit in Investor Day about mall traffic, just traffic in general and I think as an industry we're all going to get much more conversant in traffic across the channels, how digital traffic is influencing ultimate sales on the stores. You know we also described that conversion what's up in the stores. Those factors blend, they influence each other, it is not simply a matter of foot traffic into the store. ","Jonathan Komp","Understood, thanks for the perspective.","Richard Johnson","Thanks Jonathan.","Operator","Susan Anderson from B. Riley FBR is online with a question.","Susan Anderson","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about the little bit of slowdown in men\u2019s footwear business in first quarter from fourth quarter and particularly with I guess basketball being better? And then maybe also if you could give a little bit more color on just a second quarter, is there a bit of a slowdown in the guide there from the mid single-digits, just kind of maybe what you're seeing and are there any shifts and launches going on in second quarter that would cause that? Thanks.","Richard Johnson","Yeah, good morning Susan. Yeah, none of our quarters actually line up linearly, right, so we had a really positive men's quarter in fourth quarter based on some of the launch and some of the heat product that was there. We continued to have a very positive quarter in the first quarter again with puts and takes on launches with the flow of product. So we're pleased with the men's business. Certainly we've seen in the aggregate the basketball business from casual and lifestyle to on court and off court. We have started to see that improve. So again as the heat comes back there we see that as a positive and certainly some of the guide in Q2 was related to products that we now know have shifted out of that order base, different than what we would have guided to at the fourth quarter even at our Investor Day as we have normal ebbs and flows and shifts of launches across periods all the time. So again a couple things have shifted out of Q2 that end up being positive for us elsewhere and that's the reflection of the guidance.","Lauren Peters","We\u2019ve seen good response to the concepts and collaboration work that our team that has been delivering both fourth quarter and Q1 and as we\u2019ve looked at what's commenced and are excited about potential for that.","Susan Anderson","Great, that's helpful. And then maybe just one follow up on the kids apparel business which looks like had a pretty big step change also this quarter. It sounded like maybe just not enough product there so I guess maybe just if you could give some color or some thoughts on when kind of get back in stock and just improvement there? ","Richard Johnson","We had some delivery issues with some late season [indiscernible] quite honestly Susan and we -- as soon as we found out about the cancellations and the delivery issues we tried to accelerate some of the shorts and T-shirt business that we know is coming. But with the later Easter and not really cooperative weather across most of the country we didn't get the benefit from the shorts and tees business but we expect to get as we get farther in the summer. So it really is sort of just a snapshot moment in time and obviously we sell the majority of our kids apparel through our Kids Foot Locker banner and I think the team did a great job there of trying to react but some of the cancellations and the delays in shipments happened late in the game.","Susan Anderson","Great, that's helpful. Thanks so much, good luck next quarter. ","Richard Johnson","Thanks Susan.","Operator","Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank is online with a question. ","Paul Trussell","Good morning. Talk a little bit more I know you just answered the question but just for further clarity, just is the 2Q revision solely due to a shift in product launch dates or are there other categories or banners that maybe aren't responding the way you thought, maybe just dig in a little bit deeper for us, just given both on the comps and on the gross margins I think the prior year outlook was for there to be relatively consistent cadence throughout the year?","Richard Johnson","Well, we talked about certainly a mid single-digit comp for the year. The quarter has never lined up perfectly so the biggest shift in the second quarter is related to products that we now know are shifting out of the quarter. So as we guided even as late as our Investor Day certainly some things have shifted and it's not abnormal, it's very normal course of business that we have puts and takes. Normally there are some things that flow back in the quarter when things flow out and as we see the second quarter right now there's been a couple of shifts out that we have not seen opportunities to flow things back in. So, clearly the merchant team is still working against that and while we'll fill in whatever gaps we can that's just what we see today as we offer this guidance. And we did talk about fairly level comps throughout the quarters but again that's what we knew at the time we guided and we're trying to update that so you all can update your models as we learn more.","Lauren Peters","Okay, again we will reiterate with second quarter being relatively lower volume quarter that impacts the leverage point both within margin and SG&A.","Paul Trussell","Got it, and then maybe just talk a little bit more about expectations around ASP both in the footwear business and then also in the apparel business?","Richard Johnson","Yeah Paul we've seen a nice trajectory of ASPs right. We've been able to continue with our vendor partners to expand ASP's and our overall ASP is a pretty complex model that's really dependent on mix. But as our merchant team works with our strategic partners and we do more collections and collaborations as opposed to things that are more generic if you will we're able to continue to drive those price points up. And I look at a lot of things that we do whether it be the Max 720s, the Max 270 some of the speed factor things with Adidas, even when you think about the feel of disruptors we're not selling at normal inline prices. We're embellishing those, we're doing special things with them and able to raise the ASP from a normal MSRP sort of point of view. So again as we continue to focus on a more premium apparel mix, as we continue to get our accessories sorted out, and as we continue to drive heat in the footwear business we see the ability to continue to expand the ASPs.","Lauren Peters","You know again as our margins look across the assortment they're very thoughtful about what we're bringing across the price line, so they were making sure that we've got cool stuff across price plans. We don't want price out of customers. ","Paul Trussell","And lastly and very quickly just on the basketball category, still negative but slight improvement sequentially. Just curious of what you're seeing on that front in terms of customer responses to player shoes as well as other Nike product?","Richard Johnson","Yeah, I extend basketball maybe on player shoes Paul, you know that there's a whole lifestyle piece of it from the AJ1 and the Air Force Ones that are certainly basketball silhouettes. And historically significant basketball products to the new platform that's out there right now with the lifestyle shoes from the NBA guys that I talked about Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, and De'Aaron Fox really strong reception to that. We've got the Gianna shoe that's coming out, LeBron continues to sell great footwear, Kyrie's shoe has got some excitement around it. So there continues to be great energy around basketball. And of course Jordan is much more than just retro when you think about the AJ1, when you think about the 6 Rings, you think about -- those are all models that heat up at various times in the cycle. So again I feel good about where the basketball product is but I think it is as important part of the product is that we're doing things like the House of Hoops court side. We're taking basketball product to where the consumers are through the House of Hoops trucks. You know so we're trying to bring a lot of energy back into the basketball category with our vendor partners.","Paul Trussell","Thanks, best of luck. ","Richard Johnson","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Sam Poser from Susquehanna is online with a question. ","Sam Poser","Thank you for taking my question, good morning. I just want to understand the buyback here that you brought back less than the quarter, could you give us what the average share count is going to be for the full year right now and sort of how you want to make up the buyback that you missed in the first quarter and future quarters?","Lauren Peters","So we published the share count. I am not going to predict average share count rate for the balance of the year.","Sam Poser","What time of the year that you are thinking about now?","Lauren Peters","We have incorporated our thoughts around that in our updated guidance.","Sam Poser","And then could you talk about the buyback, you brought back 32,000 shares and clearly you plan to buyback more to move the needle, why not make that -- what is -- why not just make up the buyback that you didn\u2019t do, you said you just got the big authorization?","Lauren Peters","We have previously described Sam the share repurchase program was opportunistic it is not formulaic. We have a $1.2 billion three year authorization and execution of the program is subject to various strategic, financial, and legal parameters that varies from time to time. If you intend to continue to implement that program when appropriate.","Sam Poser","Okay, and then Dick when you think about the back half of the year and the trajectory of the same store sales, I mean, do you foresee it sort of to Q2 as a low point, Q3 as the high point, and Q4 somewhere in the middle, is that a fair way to think about it?","Richard Johnson","Well, as you talked about shifts out of Q2 we clearly call out that we expect a little more pressure on Q2. We are up against bigger comp improvement in Q3 and Q4 but feel good about the back half based on the product flow. I wish I was a good enough prognosticator Sam to think big little in between but we see the product flow and again the mid single-digits for the year. Third quarter is shaping up nicely with the back to school season and holiday, I believe there's going to be a lot of heat in the marketplace. So, again the shifts out of Q2 are the only thing that we really changed our thought process around and clearly they go out of the quarter. So that's a negative in Q2 but some real positives elsewhere.","Sam Poser","And then I mean, I don't think you guided to but can you give us I mean, I guess you get backed into it, you haven\u2019t changed your gross margin to your other calculations, so you are planning on making back a lot of your -- given what's been happening to you, you are planning on making back a lot in the third and fourth quarter is it fair?","Lauren Peters","We reiterated our guidance for the full year. So 20 to 40 improvement within gross margin and 40 to 60 delevering SG&A. So you've got the first quarter, we've explained the second quarter in detail that should help you with the back half.","Sam Poser","Okay, thank you and then lastly, Dick have you seen any change, have you seen a major evolutionary change in the way again and the continued way people are shopping for products and vis-\u00e0-vis what your plans were as recently as the Investor Day, have there been even further changes that might be worth noting that now you have to adjust to what's there few months ago?","Richard Johnson","I really don't think so Sam. I mean our consumer is very digitally connected and I think Lauren did a nice job explaining that we think about total traffic and the consumer is very much driven to investigate and connect with us and create -- our job is to create engagement with them through the digital channels and how they choose to shop and buy we haven't seen a significant change. But as Lauren pointed out conversion in the stores was up so kids are coming in, having done their research, they know the products in the store, they come in, they buy, and they close that. I think the thing that we will see going forward is an opportunity with our FLX program as we cross our portfolio of banners with that then I believe we'll be able to understand the consumers' behavior even better. But there's nothing different today Sam, certainly then we would have talked about it at our Investor Day. The consumer continues to move fast, they are digitally led, they are very digitally connected, and I think our team is doing a great job of connecting with them digitally through the storytelling and the trends that we are driving. And that's a tough business driver, a mid single-digit comp in the first quarter.","Sam Poser","Thanks very much.","Richard Johnson","Thanks Sam. ","Operator","Cristina Fernandez [Telsey Advisory Group] is online with a question.","Christina Fernandez","Yeah, I wanted to ask about the level of promotional activity, what do you see in the quarter and with a lot of retailers in the mall talking about first quarter sales sort of full and the second quarter going to an off -- getting off to a slow start as you look through the year, did you see the environment being more the same or less promotional?","Richard Johnson","Thanks for the question Christina. You know what our markdowns continue to run as we talked about before at almost record lows. And I think there was some promotion in the marketplace but our teams effort around collections and great content and creating premium executions on things really create a buying opportunity and our consumer continues to be driven by selling or by buying premium products. I guess the place that would be a little bit different it's still pretty promotional across the European market. Our team is being shifted the assortment we're back to a more premium positioning there as well. So there is a lot of promotion in the marketplace. I would agree with you a 100% but our team has done a great job of bringing excitement and heat to the stores and we have not had the certainly clear product but we have not had to get into a deep discounting, deep markdowns cadence regardless what is going on in the marketplace. ","Lauren Peters","So one of the reasons why we're so, so focused on the quality of our inventory, its freshness, and how it turns because being good at that continue to be that premium price selling environment.","Christina Fernandez","And then can you update us on some of the strategic investments you've made as far Super Heroic Rockets of Awesome when should we expect to see that on the stores and then as it relates to the FLX program any feedback that you've been getting early reads on Lady Foot Locker and when the timing of the rollout across the broader chain is, thank you? ","Richard Johnson","Well Christina I will start with FLX, right. I think the team has done a great job of getting Lady Foot Locker and we have launched it in a relatively small banner for specific reasons to try to see where the break points might be to see where there's friction points that we didn't anticipate, understanding the unintended consequences etcetera. But the response from our Lady Foot Locker consumer and our Foot Locker consumer in the Netherlands has been very positive. We've seen points aggregation, we've seen benefit redemption, and the benefit center is really the place that we have the greatest amount of learnings yet and understanding what motivates our consumer to take those points that they've accumulated and use them for something that they find really exciting. So good learning so far I'm not going to commit to dates, we see further roll out throughout the back half of the year as we bring more banners into the fold. But as we've committed all along we are going to crawl with this one before we walk and ultimately have a multi portfolio or multi banner approach to it that leverages our entire portfolio. ","On the investments we continue to be inspired and enthused with the people that we've invested in and the companies that we've invested in. We've had a couple of great events with Super Heroic and Jayson and his team at some of the power stores that we've opened. Katie and her team at Carbon38 continue to do great things. Devin and the pencil team we continue to work with them by identifying more opportunities to create really unique products opportunities for Foot Locker family. And Rachel and the team you know at Rockets of Awesome, we're continuing to understand what their subscription business means and what the real digital only lead sales opportunity presents. And then we're working hard with Eddie [indiscernible] to figure out what the right implementation with them is along the way. So we continue to make progress. You'll hear and see more about that as we as we go forward Christina.","Operator","Erin Murphy from Piper Jaffray is online with a question.","Eric Johnson","Good morning, thanks for taking our question. It is Eric on for Erinn today. I was just curious with four ASPs being flat in the quarter, seems like the first time it hasn't grown in a number of quarters or years, is that just a reflection of mark down optimization and if so is there any room or opportunity to continue to improve that with RFID, better use of omnichannel, etc? ","Richard Johnson","Well, as we have talked about earlier I'd see continued opportunity to expand our ASP's. We did have a flat order of footwear but overall ASPs were up as we shifted to a more premium apparel presentation. ","Lauren Peters","But I would say that on a footwear you can't lose sight of the fact that it's -- when we say footwear is flat you are mixed across gender and naturally with high single-digit comps and kids. Those are at lower price point. We also have very strong women's, low double-digit comp growth, men's is mid single. So you got to mix all of that out and that's what needles a flattish footwear. ","Eric Johnson","Okay, understood and then on the remodel activity, a little bit slower pace in Q1 than we have seen for a number of years, is that a reflection of more priority on Tech I.T. power store, your fleet in a pretty good position from a refreshment standpoint?","Richard Johnson","A lot of the remodels are tied to lease expirings and potential to relocate and things like that Eric. So you know there's not a -- it's not a linear sort of progression as leases are signed and expire at various points. So we opened some big properties, we did open a couple of power stores, we opened up the store at jewel in Shanghai or in Singapore. So again some great opportunities on the big size and remodels will continue because the refreshment of the fleet is a continuous sort of opportunity for us to improve. ","Eric Johnson","Thank you very helpful. ","Operator","Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse is online with the questions. ","Michael Binetti","Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. I just want -- Lauren, I just want to dig in, I think there's a little confusion around the share buyback and I'm trying not to ask the same question again but I mean you know the buying back earlier in the year obviously adds the most firepower to the EPS for the year and you guys had a lot of spending you wanted to do for the year. So you knew the expenses will be tight. I'm just -- it seems like maybe you just explained but it seems like your opportunity to buy shares in the first quarter must have been fairly restrictive around the timing of the earnings call and the Analyst Day and I also have to think you would've put more of that share repurchase to work to the extent that you had discretion to it, anyway you can add a little bit of color to the thinking there?","Lauren Peters","I don\u2019t know how I will add more color than we have described. It's an opportunistic program, it's not formulaic and it is subject to various strategic, financial, and legal parameters which vary from time to time. ","Michael Binetti","Were those restrictions somehow elevated in first quarter I suppose. ","Lauren Peters","I'm not going to elaborate on that.","Michael Binetti","Okay, and let me add, I think what we're also wrestling with is the -- is how to think through the very good holiday you had last year, when was the 9 comp and how to hurdle that this year. I mean we are subject to trying to forecast these things using traditional metrics like same store sales, two year comps, three year comps, sequential changes in the business, sales per foot, we don't have the benefit of seeing the merchandise plan that you guys have. And I know -- I have covered you guys long enough to know that you guys deliver upside to your targets way more than downside. But I think we're just wrestling with how to piece together some of the confidence you have given the restrictions that we have in forecasting your business against a really great holiday last year. As we look at the fourth quarter this year I think it will be a discussion here for the next few quarters so I'm just wondering if you have anything, you know, I'm not trying to pin you down on a single quarter, I know you don't want to get into that but as you think about a big quarter like this anything you can help us as how you think when you see a big comp like that coming and plan your business to help get over big hurdles on a one year basis like that that we could maybe use to help us seeing as we can't really do a lot with fashion or launch volumes in our models? ","Richard Johnson","Well I can't build your model Michael unfortunately or fill in any more of the blanks in your models than we tried to help you with. And our team understands that we live in a comp world. So no matter what we did last year our objective is to get over that hill and they work with our vendor partners. They work through product assortments. They work through launch dates etc. to do just that and we're generally to your point able to deliver against that. When we see a high trump in Q4 from last year our team gets their game face on and goes after it to try to figure out how to get over that hurdle. So I think we've shared some of the product heat that we see coming. We've talked about some of the puts and takes on launches etcetera. And you know our team is focused on delivering against the mid single-digit comp for the year and we don't -- unfortunately I don't live as much quarter-to-quarter as you all do. We look at a longer term point of view and make the investments that are right for us from a product perspective. And the flow maybe quarter-to-quarter in line with your model and it may not be and that's just the nature of retail. ","Michael Binetti","I understand. Thanks for the help on that.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Lance for closing remarks. ","Jim Lance","Okay, thank you for joining us today. Please join us again for next earnings call which we anticipate will take place at 9 AM on Friday, August 23rd. The call will follow the release of our second quarter results earlier that morning. Thanks again and good-bye.","Richard Johnson","Enjoy the long weekend all. ","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect. "]}}
