[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jennifer K. Driscoll","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast for Campbell Soup Company.","With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, CFO and Chief Administrative Officer; Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations.","I'm going to comment first on items in the quarter, including impacts from our European simple meals business, which we sold on October 28, the first day of our second quarter. Denise will follow me with her perspective on our first quarter results, focusing on the main profit drivers year-over-year and expectations for fiscal 2014. Craig will wrap it up with a more detailed look at the financial and segment results for the first quarter and our adjusted expectations for fiscal 2014. After that, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com and on our investor relations app, which is available through Google or Apple.","Please keep in mind that our call is open to members of the media, who are participating in listen-only mode.","Also keep in mind our presentation today includes forward-looking statements, which reflects the company's current expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks.","Please refer to Slide 3 in the presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements.","We've been reporting Europe's operating results in discontinued operations. The sale resulted in changes in continuing operations in Q1, with Q2 impacts being covered later in our remarks today. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the company recorded an unrealized loss of $9 million, $6 million after tax, or $0.02 per share, on foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge the proceeds from the sale of the European simple meals business. The loss is included in other expense.","In addition, the company recorded tax expense of $7 million, $0.02 per share, associated with the sale of the business. Both were recognized in continuing operations.","Separate from Europe, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $20 million, which is $13 million after tax, or $0.04 per share, in continuing operations associated with initiatives to streamline our salaried workforce in North America and in the Asia Pacific region.","We also recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $1 million and restructuring-related costs of $2 million in cost of products sold related to the fiscal 2013 previously announced initiative.","Last year, in Q1, we recorded a restructuring charge of $20 million pretax and $20 million pretax of restructuring-related charges related to supply chain initiatives and $10 million in Bolthouse transaction costs.","The cost of our recent Plum recall was not adjusted out.","Since our presentation includes several non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules, we've provided a reconciliation of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation. These slides, along with our earnings release and selected quarterly financials, also can be found on our website, accessible online, or any mobile device with the Campbell IR app.","This earnings call is available live on the web and will be saved later as an archived audiocast. You can find it at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com under News & Events. Just click on Recent Webcasts & Presentations.","And with that, let me turn it over to Denise.","Denise M. Morrison","Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying that I'm disappointed with our first quarter results, which failed to meet our expectations and yours. I own this, and so does our entire management team. But we are not discouraged because we understand what happened, we know what we have to do, and we're determined to improve our performance over the next 3 quarters.","Based on our first quarter sales and profit performance versus our expectations, we're lowering our full year guidance for fiscal 2014 by 1 point at each line. From continuing operations, we now expect growth of 4% to 5% in net sales, 4% to 6% in adjusted EBIT and 2% to 4% in adjusted EPS with a range of $2.53 to $2.58 per share.","This guidance reflects our expectation that Campbell will deliver considerably stronger results in the balance of the year.","This morning, I'll review the factors that had a significant impact on our first quarter results and explain how we expect to improve our performance for the remainder of the year. I will also review strategic steps that we've taken to continue to reshape Campbell and our future growth trajectory.","The key factors in the quarter were: first, movements in inventory levels by U.S. retailers and program timing; second, weakness in our core business trends; third, our decision to front-load marketing spend to support the growth of new products; and finally, our voluntary recall of a range of Plum Organic products.","Although it's not an exact science and these are estimates, I want to give you a sense of the relative impact these factors had on our first quarter adjusted EBIT, which was down 20% versus prior year.","Movements in retailer inventory levels and program timing drove approximately 6 points of the EBIT decline. Declines in our core business trends reduced EBIT by approximately 6 points. Increased advertising and consumer promotion accounted for about 4 points, and the Plum recall accounted for nearly 4 points of the decline.","Movements in inventory levels and program timing drove more than half of our decline in organic sales. The greatest impact was in U.S. Soup, where movements in retailer inventory levels negatively impacted first quarter sales by approximately 4% or 2\/3 of the decline versus prior year.","As we said in our last earnings call, we entered the first quarter with retailer inventory above year-ago levels, particularly in Soup. What we didn't expect was that some retailers also chose to reduce the average amount of inventory on hand versus the prior year, adjusting to a weak consumer environment. This had a negative, unplanned impact on our sales, and we ended the quarter with retailer inventory levels below year ago.","In quarter 2, we're seeing more positive inventory movements. Significant shifts in our program timing and execution also pressured our first quarter results, especially in U.S. Soup. As we discussed with you in September, we expected this year's late Thanksgiving holiday to put pressure on our first quarter results. In fact, many large U.S. customers placed their orders later than the prior year. This required us to hold off on shipping holiday items until after Halloween. These items include Campbell condensed soups, gravy, Swanson Broth and Pepperidge Farm Stuffing. The upside is that we expect the holiday timing to have a positive impact on sales in the second quarter, as it will have more Thanksgiving shipments to customers than last year's quarter.","We're seeing evidence of that right now, and I'm certainly encouraged by the strong acceleration in Soup and Pepperidge Farm shipments and by the merchandising we've seen so far in November.","In the first quarter, U.S. Soup was lapping strong promotional activity in the year-earlier period, when we partnered with key customers on major promotions of Campbell condensed soup that drove volume during the back-to-school period.","This year, our soup promotion is more heavily weighted to the second and third quarters, which we will -- we anticipate will be more effective at the height of the soup season. Some of our first quarter promotions were scaled back or not repeated. These actions impacted condensed and ready-to-serve consumption and sales in the first quarter. Although first quarter soup consumption declined, we grew share in the quarter.","Looking ahead, we expect soup consumption trends to pick up in the balance of the year as consumers respond to effective marketing and promotions, taste improvements and new products as we enter the winter months. In fact, our total U.S. Soup gross sales are up 8% month-to-date in November from the prior year.","To help drive renewed growth in both condensed and ready-to-serve soup consumption and build on our momentum in broth, we have planned competitive advertising levels in the coming quarters to get Soup sales back on track. We expect our new Campbell Homestyle Soup to be a growth driver this year, and we're accelerating innovation by pushing up the launch of 8 new soups that were originally planned for the end of the fiscal year. These new soups will now be launched in the second and third quarters, and they include new varieties of Campbell's Chunky and Healthy Request soups and our first Hispanic-inspired cooking soups.","A second factor impacting our profit performance was our decision to front-load marketing investments in the first quarter to support new products. Specifically, our advertising and consumer promotion expense in the first quarter increased 14% from the year-earlier period. We supported new product launches in Soup and Simple Meals and made investments in Bolthouse Farms to drive better brand awareness and expand its leadership position in packaged fresh foods.","We made strategic choices to launch new products while maintaining competitive levels of advertising in the core. This included supporting Campbell's Homestyle Soup, Slow Cooker Sauces and Skillet Sauces with strong national advertising campaigns that encompass digital, social and TV. Although it is still early days, I'm encouraged by the velocity of Campbell's Homestyle Soup and dinner sauces in response to our advertising. But the benefits of advertising tend to build over time, and we expect new product sales will continue to accelerate as the year progresses.","As we reported today, we continue to face challenges in North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverages. This is the last quarter where Foodservice is cycling the loss of a major customer, and we expect better comps going forward. Foodservice performed as expected in the quarter.","However, U.S. Beverages performed below our expectations. Our V8 brand continues to be under pressure from category weakness in shelf-stable juices and competition from the proliferation of specialty beverages and packaged fresh juices. As we've said before, we are implementing a turnaround plan to stem the decline and strengthen U.S. Beverages in the long run, but we don't expect it to be a growth driver this year. We're focused on reducing cost and driving innovation, such as V8 V-Fusion Refreshers and V8 V-Fusion + Energy.","Our first quarter results also reflected the impact of a recall on a range of Plum Organic pouch products. We initiated this recall after discovering a manufacturing defect that may cause spoilage in some pouches. As Craig will discuss in greater detail, the cost of this recall had a significant negative impact on our first quarter EBIT. Our priority is to continue to build consumer and customer trust in this wonderful brand.","Looking briefly at Global Baking and Snacking. I'm encouraged by the solid performance of Pepperidge Farm in the quarter and by our progress in reshaping and expanding our International business, including our acquisition of Kelsen Group and our growth in emerging markets. Pepperidge Farm grew sales of Goldfish crackers and fresh bakery and rolled out exciting new products. Going forward, we are supporting the national rollout of Goldfish Puffs with a television and digital campaign. And in Q2, we're launching Goldfish Mac & Cheese nationally.","In addition, Pepperidge Farm expects a boost from Thanksgiving shipments in the second quarter. Overall, we expect this business to deliver continued solid growth this year.","Turning to our international biscuits portfolio. The integration of Kelsen, which has given us a baked snacks platform in China, Hong Kong and other international markets, is on track. We're readying Kelsen brands for the important holiday season.","In emerging markets, we expect to deliver dynamic growth in Arnott's biscuits in Indonesia this year. We are doing some heavy lifting to address our challenges in Australia, where we're focused on reducing cost and reinvigorating growth in Arnott's.","We've strengthened the leadership and are reorganizing the team. Our new President of Asia, Pacific, \u00dcmit Subasi, is now on board. \u00dcmit has extensive experience in turning around businesses and establishing new operations in emerging economies.","Now I'll discuss several important steps that we have taken as we continue to reshape Campbell and redefine our future growth trajectory.","In the first quarter, we concluded our negotiations to sell our European simple meals business for EUR 400 million. This transaction, which closed in the second quarter, enables us to focus our investments and resources on faster-growing businesses and markets and on brands that we believe we can grow around the world.","We now have 10 powerful brands with sales of more than $100 million each, led by a our flagship Campbell brand at $2.1 billion. With the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, Plum Organics and Kelsen, we added a trio of growth engines with combined sales of more than $1 billion to diversify our portfolio. We will continue to look for smart external development opportunities that create value.","The second step relates to our ongoing focus on reducing SG&A expense and total delivered cost as a strategic imperative. Campbell is driving productivity and rightsizing our global workforce to fund sustainable growth in a challenging consumer and economic environment.","Over the past 2 years, we exited 4 plants and streamlined our Campbell North America operations in order to optimize our supply chain and increase efficiency. These actions have resulted in annualized cost savings of approximately $40 million.","In our first quarter of this fiscal year, we continued our progress by implementing further initiatives that are expected to deliver annualized cost savings of approximately $40 million. Importantly, we will reinvest some of these incremental cost savings in brand building and innovation.","Based on the company's solid performance last year and our outlook for this year, Campbell Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend during the first quarter by 7.6%. With this increase, Campbell's shareholders will receive a payout of almost $1.25 per share on an annualized basis. This dividend increase reflects the company's strong cash flow, continued confidence in our strategic plan and our firm commitment to enhance shareholder value.","So in closing, we are off to a slow start to the year and face a tougher road than we anticipated. But we know what we have to do to strengthen our performance over the balance of the year, and the second quarter is off to a solid start.","In summary, I'm disappointed but not discouraged. I firmly believe that we're taking the right steps to drive sustainable, profitable net sales growth, and I'm determined to do so.","Now I'll turn the call over to Craig Owens for a full review of our segment results, and then we'll get to your questions.","B. Craig Owens","Thanks, Denise, and good morning, everyone. Well, as Denise said, we are disappointed in the results that we're reporting. Today, we want to be sure that we're providing you with a clear understanding of the elements of the first quarter results, as well as indicators of the opportunity that we see in the balance of the year.","I'll spend a few minutes discussing the first quarter and segment highlights, followed by comments on our full year sales and earnings guidance.","As Jennifer mentioned, my discussion will exclude the impact of acquisition transaction costs in the prior year, restructuring programs in both the current and the prior years and a loss on foreign exchange forward contracts and a tax expense related to the sale of our European business but recorded in continuing operations in the first quarter.","On October 28, after the close of the first quarter, the company completed the divestiture of the European simple meals business. That business is reported in discontinued operations in the first quarter.","For the quarter, we reported net sales from continuing operations of $2.2 billion, a 2% decrease from the prior year. These results include a 4-point contribution from acquisitions, which consist of Plum Organics; Kelsen, which was acquired on August 8; and 1 additional week of the results of Bolthouse Farms, which was acquired 1 week into the quarter last year.","Excluding acquisitions and the negative impact of currency, organic net sales decreased by 4% with declines across all segments except for Global Baking and Snacking, which was comparable to prior year. The organic sales performance was negatively impacted by movements in retailer inventory levels across several of our businesses.","Adjusted EBIT decreased 20% to $337 million, reflecting lower sales, increased advertising investment, expenses related to the Plum product recall and a lower gross margin percentage.","Adjusted earnings per share were $0.66, a 21% decrease versus the prior year, driven by the EBIT decline.","The next slide shows the composition of the 2% sales decline. The organic sales decrease of 4 points reflects 4 points of unfavorable volume\/mix, 1 point of increased promotional spending, which is offset by 1 point of pricing. Unfavorable currency had a 1-point impact due to the Australian and Canadian dollars weakening against the U.S. dollar.","You'll note that the detail does not add to the total due to rounding.","The unfavorable volume\/mix is driven by 2 of our U.S. segments: U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages. The pricing gains were primarily related to our list price increase on condensed soup in the U.S. and price increases across our Baking and Snacking segment. These increases were partially offset by pricing declines in Mexico based on our new distribution business model. The promotional spending variance was primarily related to higher rates of spending in U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 220 basis points to 36%. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of Kelsen and Plum. The combination of purchase accounting inventory step-up for Kelsen and the Plum recall had a negative impact of 1 full point. The ongoing impact on gross margin from the addition of the lower-margin Kelsen and Plum businesses is about 40 basis points. The balance of the margin reduction was largely due to negative mix. The inflation rate and cost of goods sold was about 3% for the quarter, entirely offset by productivity savings.","Marketing and selling expense increased $25 million to $261 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher advertising to support new product launches, including Campbell's Homestyle Soups and Campbell's dinner sauce products, as well as new advertising to support the Bolthouse brands.","The addition of Kelsen and Plum Organics also contributed to the increase.","Administrative expense decreased $7 million to $148 million, primarily due to lower compensation and benefit costs, including pension expense. Acquisitions added approximately $5 million.","For the quarter, net interest expense decreased $3 million to $30 million. The decrease was due to lower average interest rates on our total debt portfolio, partly offset by higher levels of debt to fund the Kelsen and Plum acquisitions.","The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%, a 20 basis point increase versus the prior year. We still expect a fiscal '14 tax rate of between 31% and 32%.","Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations decreased 21% to $209 million, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased to $0.66 for the quarter.","First quarter segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on Slide 28. Our U.S. Simple Meals segment delivered $860 million in sales, including a $15 million contribution from the acquisition of Plum Organics. U.S. Simple Meals organic sales declined by 6%. Within the segment, U.S. Soup sales also decreased by 6%. 2\/3 of this decrease was due to movements in retailer inventory levels. Retailers entered the quarter with somewhat higher inventories than prior year. They worked these down and reduced end-of-period inventories versus prior year, partially due to the later timing of Thanksgiving.","Excluding the impact of the Plum acquisition, U.S. sauce sales decreased by 4%. Declines in gravy, paste and canned pasta were partially offset by the introduction of Campbell's Slow Cooker Sauces and gains in Prego, which benefited from our new white sauces.","Our Global Baking and Snacking segment delivered $609 million in sales, including a $52 million contribution from Kelsen. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year, with growth in Pepperidge Farm in Indonesia offset by declines in Arnott's in Australia.","The sales gains in Pepperidge Farm reflected growth across fresh bakery and crackers. In the bakery business, Sandwich Bread & Rolls posted double-digit volume gains, benefited from -- benefiting from the market absence of the former Hostess brands, which are just now beginning to return to the shelf. These gains were partially offset by declines in stuffing, primarily due to the holiday timing shift.","The Snacks business had another quarter of growth, with good increases in Goldfish snack crackers partially offset by declines in adult cracker varieties. Sales of cookies were comparable to the prior year. Sales in Arnott's decreased, primarily due to sales decreases in Australia, primarily in chocolate varieties, partially offset by strong growth in Indonesia.","Our Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segment posted $330 million in sales, including $14 million from the additional week of Bolthouse Farms sales in the current quarter. Organic sales declined 2%, reflecting the loss of a major restaurant customer in Foodservice 1 year ago, while Bolthouse sales were comparable to a year ago, as sales growth in premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings were offset by declines in bulk sales of juice concentrate.","International Simple Meals and Beverages delivered $193 million in sales for the quarter. Organic sales decreased by 7% due to declines in Canada, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region.","Sales in Canada were negatively impacted by increased promotional spending related to the launch of new soup items. The sales decline in Latin America is attributed to lower selling prices associated with the implementation of the new business model in Mexico. And sales in Asia Pacific declined due to our Australian soup business.","U.S. Beverage sales declined 8% to $173 million. The decrease in sales was most pronounced in V8 V-Fusion beverages. Sales of V8 Vegetable Juice and V8 Splash also fell.","Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals decreased 23% to $211 million for the quarter. Within the segment, the decline in operating earnings was primarily driven by lower volumes, higher advertising expense and expenses related to the Plum product recall, partially offset by productivity improvements and net price realization in Soup.","Operating earnings for Global Baking and Snacking decreased 8% to $78 million. Earnings declines at Arnott's and the unfavorable impact of currency were partially offset by earnings gains at Pepperidge Farm. For the segment, the earnings decline was primarily driven by cost inflation, partially offset by higher net selling prices.","Operating earnings within Bolthouse and Foodservice decreased by 15% to $29 million. The decline in operating earnings was primarily driven by cost inflation and increased advertising for Bolthouse Farms. Bolthouse benefited from the comparison to 1 less week last year.","Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages decreased by 20%, primarily due to lower volume.","Within international Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings decreased by 39% to $20 million. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to lower volume, lower selling price and increased promotional spending.","On Slide 31, you see U.S. Soup sales for the quarter declining 6%. Recall that approximately 4 points can be attributed to retailer inventory movement and timing.","Sales of condensed soup declined 7% with declines in both eating and cooking varieties. Volume loss was partially offset by higher net pricing.","Ready-to-serve soup sales fell 11%, driven by declines in both canned and microwavable soup varieties.","Broth sales increased 3%, primarily driven by double-digit gains in aseptic broth. Campbell's measured consumer takeaway in wet soup for the quarter was down 2%.","On Slide 32, we look at U.S. wet soup category performance in the past 52 weeks ended October 27, 2013, and our share performance within the category. The category as a whole rose 2.8%. Our sales in measured channels rose 3.4% with gains driven by ready-to-serve, broth and condensed soup.","Campbell had nearly a 60% market share, an increase of 30 basis points. All other branded players, collectively, had a share of 28%; and private label, a share of 13%.","These figures were sourced from SymphonyIRI's multi-outlet report and are based on dollar sales.","Cash flow from operations was $38 million, compared with $81 million in the prior year. The decline is due to lower earnings, partially offset by a lower pension contribution. The pension contribution in fiscal '14 was $40 million versus $76 million last year.","Capital expenditures of $52 million rose from $41 million a year ago. We're still expecting capital expenditures for the year to be about $350 million.","As we've previously announced, we suspended the strategic share repurchase program at the end of fiscal 2012 in order to reduce the debt incurred to finance the Bolthouse acquisition. However, we will continue to repurchase sufficient shares to offset dilution from equity compensation programs.","Net debt rose to $4.5 billion, an increase of $441 million, primarily due to acquisitions.","In the quarter, we also retired a $300 million note.","Results of the European simple meal business are reported as discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations for the first quarter was $9 million or $0.03 per share, compared with earnings of $13 million or $0.04 per share last year.","The change in earnings was primarily due to costs associated with the divestiture, including additional tax expense related to the difference between tax and book basis of the business.","In the second quarter, the company anticipates recognizing a net gain of approximately $75 million after tax, or $0.24 per share, from the sale of the European simple meal business.","Campbell's has adjusted its previous fiscal 2014 guidance. Campbell now expects continuing operations to grow sales by 4% to 5%, adjusted EBIT by 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS by 2% to 4%.","The downward adjustment of guidance by 1 point at each line is a recognition of our shortfall versus expectation in the first quarter. Our forecast is for significant improvement in performance in the last 3 quarters and the reversal of some of the retailer inventory positions.","As a reminder, fiscal '14 comprises 53 weeks, 1 additional week compared to last year, the benefit of which is now expected to be partially offset by the impact of currency translation.","The contribution to sales from acquisitions will be lower than the $300 million in our original forecast due to the Plum recall. It's difficult, at this point, to estimate the full year impact of the recall on Plum, but we believe that our new guidance range encompasses this risk.","In connection with the new business model in Mexico, reported sales and cost of products sold will be reduced by approximately $40 million. EPS growth reflects the impact of a significant increase in the tax rate.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jennifer.","Jennifer K. Driscoll","Thanks, Craig. At this time, we will conduct the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Kate?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had a question for you with regard to organic revenue growth. And I guess, as I think about those various factors that worked against revenue during the quarter, the recall, the inventory reductions, it would seem like a lot of this is going to be overcome, if you will, later in the year by improving underlying organic revenue growth. I just want to understand, I guess, first of all, how much organic revenue growth you foresee within that 4% to 5%. And then, I guess, just from a modeling standpoint, do we expect, therefore, an increase in inventory in 2Q to counteract some of the declines here in the first quarter?","B. Craig Owens","So Chris, to answer the last question first. I think that the expectation on inventory, if you look at the first quarter, not only did we work down some of the inventory overhang, if you will, from prior year, but retailers actually finished the quarter lower than prior year inventories. We would expect to get that back. And in fact, we have pretty good evidence that it's coming back for us in November. So yes, a partial reversal of some of the inventory issues there. The expectation with respect to organic sales growth going forward is that we would finish the year, I think, with a modest organic sales growth. So positive in the last 3 quarters.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just to follow up on that. Did you indicate on the call, I may have missed it, but that the month-to-date in November Soup sales are up 8%? Did I get that correct?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, that's the gross sales, month-to-date, up 8%.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So again, some of the -- given what we see in SymphonyIRI and Nielsen data, assuming it's still a little challenged in the Soup category, that gap would be defined by the incremental inventory, it seems like.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. And I -- we believe that, that's cycling the Hurricane Sandy consumption.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask about new products as a percent of sales? I guess, within the Soup business, you're managing a transition out of the more traditional products into these new packaging formats. How are those going so far this soup season? Because I remember this time last year, they were a little light versus expectations.","Denise M. Morrison","I think that the best way to think about this, Alexia, is the Go Soup, the Campbell's Slow Kettle and the Bisques and the boxed soups are building a premium segment of the soup category, and we're very encouraged by the growth in that particular segment. And we'll continue to build new varieties on that -- in those lines this year.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And how much do they represent of the U.S. Soups business now, that premium category?","B. Craig Owens","It's still pretty small, Alexia. It's not a very significant portion of our total soup sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So some modeling questions. In the context of the first quarter shortfall, it is -- it's difficult to see the clear path to your full year guidance. Can you help us with a little more granular detail of some of the puts and takes that give you the confidence to get there? And also, any insight you can share on the second quarter because it seems like delivering the full year is really predicated on a pretty heroic second quarter delivery.","B. Craig Owens","So I think, first of all, in the second quarter, we would -- as we said, we'd expect to recapture some of the first quarter impact of sales below consumption or lower retailer inventories. Across the year, we will see the progressive benefit of new products and innovation that will help the top line. As we mentioned, in our Foodservice business, we're lapping the loss of one of our major customers, so the first quarter is the last time that you see that impact. Clearly, the Plum impact in the first quarter is a one-off in terms of the recall amount, though there may be some ongoing impact on the Plum business as we go forward. With respect to profit measures as opposed to sale measures, we also -- well, actually, impacting both things, we have the restructuring benefit, some of which will be reinvested to help us drive top line growth as we move through the year. So, I mean, there are a fair number of factors. As you look at the first quarter, I think you see a combination of some one-off impacts and some weakness in the core business, no question about that, but then as we look forward, we think we've got some offsets and some benefits to the balance of the year. And it does make for a significant swing first quarter to back 3.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. And Jason, we have significantly stronger programming in the second and third quarters this year versus prior year and so -- where we had weaker programming in the first quarter.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If your programming was so much weaker in the third quarter, why was the promotional drag on top line a negative 2%?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Yes. Part of that is due to the fact that, in Soup, as we list -- raised list prices, we held the promoted price, so you have -- it shows up as a higher rate on promotion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Last year, you launched -- at this time of the year, you launched 2 new soup brands, the Go Soups and the Gourmet Bisques, and yet you were able to reduce your marketing expenses. However, Chunky did better even with lower marketing expenses and so on. So last year, lower marketing expenses, better performance. This year, you're stepping up your marketing spending to support Homestyle, which is -- as you relabeled 100% Natural, and yet the performance is down. Why this discrepancy in performance, given the change in marketing spending?","Denise M. Morrison","Okay. let me clarify that. First of all, our marketing efforts on our new products last year, when we launched them, particularly our soups and our Skillet Sauces, we believe, was insufficient to generate the trial that we needed to get to. We actually had better repeat on those products, but the trial was a slower build. So learning from that, this year, we decided to invest in marketing upfront and give our new soup and sauce products a proper launch into the marketplace. And we believe that, that was the right decision. For clarity, Campbell\u2019s Homestyle is a different kind of soup than 100% Natural. So even though we discontinued 100% Natural and Campbell Homestyle will go into the marketplace in its place, it is a totally different consumer proposition based on a need state of fresh-made goodness. So the -- we felt that it was really important to properly communicate that right out of the gate to consumers and customers.","B. Craig Owens","Thilo, I think the other thing you have to recognize is that the advertising spend on the base business last year was down versus 2012, right? So if you're looking at total advertising spend, the base business spend this year would have been about flat, with the support against new products on top of it, whereas last year, you had a decrease in base spending.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","The one other point I'd mention, there is the significant amount of spend to launch our new dinner sauces into both Slow Cooker and to support Skillet Sauces. So we're still in the awareness and trial-building part of that evolution, so you don't necessarily see it in top line growth in the current quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Craig, very quickly, what was D&A in the quarter, if you can? And then Denise, I wanted to get a better sense for why your team's initial forecasts were perhaps a bit off for the Thanksgiving shift. As far as you can tell, was it more the case of retailers ordering less than they had previously indicated, or was it more to do with maybe a hiccup, I guess, in the forecasting process on Campbell's part? I'm just trying to get a sense of why the magnitude of the Thanksgiving shift impact, I guess, caught you guys slightly offguard.","Denise M. Morrison","I'll take the second part first. Obviously, we knew, when we forecasted, that Thanksgiving was going to come later in the year and that Halloween would actually fall in the second quarter. However, what we didn't expect was that retailers would hold off ordering Thanksgiving holiday merchandise until after the Halloween inventory was on the floor and depleted when, in fact, that was the behavior that we experienced this year. In a traditional first quarter, we actually do have Thanksgiving shipments going to market, particularly in the last 2 weeks in October. That did not happen this year. And yet, the day after Halloween, we saw our shipments tick up in a big way. So we do have confidence in the fact that this was a shift in inventory for the holiday.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","On your other question, depreciation and amortization in the quarter was about $75 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two quick questions, so just little ones, and then a more important one. A&C for the year's -- I don't think you actually said what your...","Jennifer K. Driscoll","I'm sorry, David. You're trying to squeeze in 3? I think you're going to have to pick one.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","They're just little details, but I'll do whatever you want. The A&C for the year, and then what was your expectation for the quarter? And then my most important question is the savings, this $80 million, the 2 $40 million chunks. Craig, can you talk about how the pacing goes on this in terms of what's incremental in Qs 2, 3 and 4? Should we be thinking that's it like $20 million incremental savings in Qs 2, 3, 4, just kind of simple math on the $80 million?","B. Craig Owens","So with respect to expectation on A&C in the first quarter, as we said when reported our fourth quarter results, we did expect A&C to be up, as it was. So there wasn't any miss versus our own expectation there. With respect to the savings on the restructuring program, the savings, not the benefit to the bottom line, because as we said, we think we will reinvest a fair bit of this for growth, but the savings for the balance of the year against the headquarters restructuring program is about $25 million. And the supply chain portion of that is about $40 million for the year, and that's already well incorporated in our discussion around enablers and inflation, which are roughly an offset this year.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Are they back-end loaded, though?","B. Craig Owens","The second one is -- sorry, the first one is. The restructuring for -- outside of the supply chain, the restructuring of world headquarters in Australia is back-end loaded.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then this is one of the reasons why the shape of the year can be so different than the first quarter numbers? I mean, the first quarter misses by $0.20, and then the back end has got -- the back 3 quarters has got just a very different EPS shape. I'm thinking that this productivity program is a big reason why?","B. Craig Owens","That is part of the reason why, yes.","Denise M. Morrison","Part of the reason, and then the expectation that we'll deliver more meaningful growth in the next 3 quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was just curious to know why you provided the gross sales for November up 8%. Is there any way you can give us a sense of what the net sales were? And then also, is that -- do you think that's the extent of the rebuilding of inventory? Or is there more rebuilding of inventory that you expect in December and January?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","On the gross sales question, we haven't closed the books for November yet, so we don't do the trade calculations until we get through the month. So the only thing we really had to provide for you today is the gross sales, which is why we did that.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is there anything unusual you had to do to get the gross sales up 8%? Or is it just your normal trade spending in November?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","No, nothing to do with trade spending. It's the volume times the list sales compared to the prior year.","B. Craig Owens","Yes, there's nothing peculiar going on at trade spending. It's just, as Anthony said, to give you an accurate number mid-month, we have to do it at the gross sales level.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, and I think largely driven by the Thanksgiving shipments starting after Halloween, which fell into the second quarter.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And as far as retailers building back inventory in December and January, that's not going to be an issue? You think you'll ship to consumption in December and January?","B. Craig Owens","Well, it's really difficult for us to forecast that, Rob, as we proved in the first quarter, right? But the -- I think the point is that we feel pretty confident because of some of the things that we've cited: the timing of Thanksgiving, some real retailer squeeze on inventories toward the end of the first quarter, that at least the below-normal inventories at the end of the first quarter would come back. And the reason we've given you the gross sales number for November is just some indication that's giving us some comfort that it has come back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Denise, in Foodservice, you've done some work there bringing capacity online and responding to some of the change in customer demands. How should we be thinking about new business wins unfolding there? Is there anything on the horizon worth noting? And, I guess, related, how would you characterize the broader foodservice environment right now?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. Well, I think the broader foodservice environment is challenged, as is the retail environment. However, we did bring some capacity online in June that is enabling us to have discussions with many more national customers to meet their needs in fresh soup. So we are having those discussions and are encouraged by the early days and expect to be on our plan on Foodservice this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just -- I guess, one clarification. Just I'm trying to -- in understanding the $0.20 variance to consensus, if I look at, I guess, the Slide #9 in the presentation, would it be a rough approximation that roughly half of it was the consensus was just too high relative to what your internal plan was and half of it is some of the inventory -- some of the things that were unanticipated by you going into the quarter?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. Bryan, I don't want to get into trying to analyze our results against the average of the consensus, but if you think about it sort of by the pieces that Denise cited in terms of things that, I guess, nobody really expected, clearly, the Plum recall and the -- part of that inventory decrease, we anticipated part of it, we didn't anticipate part of it, were clearly unexpected. And the weakness in the base business was largely unexpected by us. That things that we did anticipate were part of the inventory timing and the front-loaded spend on marketing. So I'd say, in terms of what was expected and what wasn't expected, there's probably over half of it that was not in our expectation.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just -- I just want to make sure I understand, I think, in your response to Dave Driscoll's question, the plan for your -- for marketing spend for the full year hasn't changed at all. So you're still anticipating the same level of spend. And then in addition, there is some incremental cost savings related to the restructuring, more restructuring savings. Did I hear that right? Relative to what your original plan was.","B. Craig Owens","Yes, so we had said that marketing would be up this year, primarily because of support to the new product introduction, and, in fact, that it would be somewhat front-loaded and that's still the plan, right? Front-loaded, you saw it in the first quarter, up for the full year but certainly not at the same rate that it was up in Q1. And so the answer is that all of those expectations are still in order. And with respect to the cost savings against restructuring, I think the point with David was, is that backloaded? And the answer is, yes, we'll see the benefit of that across the last 3 quarters.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But relative to what was in the guidance that you gave at the beginning of the year, there isn't more savings in your plan now than there was at the beginning of the year?","B. Craig Owens","I think the way I would think about that is that the restructuring has given us some opportunity to help make up some of the loss that we had in the first quarter, particularly through reinvestment in greater growth in the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick one on the acceleration of some of your products you talked about. I certainly understand why you're lumping those up a little bit to get sort of the top line moving and what have you. I guess, I'm just curious why, if those new items were ready to go, why, I guess, the plan was originally not to put them out until the end of the fiscal year. Is it just you had enough going on already, you thought? Was it a capabilities concern that you didn't want to put too much out there at the same time? Or -- trying to get a sense because it seems like you're still in the mode of, even excluding this quarter, you're still trying to obviously get the overall top line and Soup momentum kind of going, right, from -- over a multi-year time frame. So I guess, why wouldn't have these new items been put out when they were ready to go?","Denise M. Morrison","The new items that I talked about accelerating, the 8 new items, were programmed to go in the next fiscal year, which meant they would be shipping the July, August time period in preparation for the next soup season. We have accelerated those new items, and some of them will be going out in quarter 2 and quarter 3. So that is as fast as we can go on those items with the right programming to support them.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","The other point on that, and Craig mentioned that the new restructuring benefit enables us to put a little marketing support behind those new items where we wouldn't have had that P&L flexibility before.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay, so I guess that's part of that. That makes sense. And then, just to revisit, I know last year's -- you talked about advertising spending behind the core was lower. Obviously, it's already at a high level against your core, but it was lower, and some of that has moved over to support some of the new items on the premium side and whatnot. Do you feel like that decision, in any way, caused you to sort of have to re-up a little bit more than you had expected this year? Maybe it cut a little too deep behind the core, which is coming back to kind of hurt things today, or do you really think that's probably not an issue in all this?","Denise M. Morrison","Andrew, we feel that the levels of advertising that we have on the core business are still at very competitive levels and that it's advertising working in conjunction with the other drivers of demand is the right formula for success on the core Soup business, as evidenced by the performance last year. On the new products, we really felt that we needed to put some more momentum behind them coming right out of the gate to get the trial curve sooner because our repeat is actually very strong on those items.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I wanted to ask, on the Beverage business, which I think you said in your prepared remarks that, that underperformed your expectations, and then you didn't see really within this fiscal year that it would really stabilize. And I guess I'm just curious, what have you seen in shelf stable versus the premium fresh beverages? Because it seems -- I know that, that was one of the major reasons you acquired Bolthouse. But it seems that even that category is coming under increased pressure because there are new entrants and it's -- whenever I look at it in the grocery store, it looks like it's kind of over-SKUed. Could you talk about sort of shelf stable versus premium fresh and the behavior of both categories, please?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. And obviously, we do play on both sides of that business. And the shelf stable juice category continues to struggle from category weakness and competition from the proliferation of specialty beverages and, as you indicated, packaged fresh juices. And we see that affecting our V8 franchise. What we do see are some bright spots. We've had 7 years of growth of V8 Splash, and we did not have the merchandising levels in the first quarter that we had last year, but we have reinstated those in the year-to-go period. So we'll handle the value end of the shelf stable juice business, which we believe has been pretty robust for us. And on the higher end, with Bolthouse Farms, we actually did see high single-digit consumption in the Beverage business, or sales in the Beverage business, and we're still ahead in share. So we will continue with the premium fresh Bolthouse business to increase our innovation going forward, and they have a very robust pipeline coming to market. So we're very encouraged by the performance of Bolthouse Farms as it looks for the year. So I think that there is definitely a shift. Where we're feeling most of the pressure is in our 100% Red juice and our V8 V-Fusion. The trends have improved slightly on the 100% Red juice, but I'm admitting that, that particular segment of the business is still under pressure.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Can you just give me a break on how much is shelf stable versus premium fresh in terms of percentage of sales or -- just trying to get an idea about how much bigger that business is, the shelf stable.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Yes, all the sales in our U.S. Beverage reporting segment are the shelf stable business. And the Bolthouse sales are in the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, and the shelf stable is about twice as large as the refrigerated.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, one of the things I failed to mention was we are also driving innovation in shelf stable juices. We have a launch of V8 Refreshers coming out and shipping as we speak. And then V8 V-Fusion + Energy is also performing way above expectations, so we're encouraged by that innovation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just on the inventory issue. Can you give us some perspective on where we are on inventory levels at retail from a historical perspective? And just as a follow-up to that, how -- I mean, in terms of stock-up trips, I mean, what's the outlook for your business longer term? And how are you managing your business strategically longer term given that it seems like stock-up trips are down, and that's hurting your business? That would be helpful.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, second part of the question first. On the stock-up trips, we've seen, for several seasons now, the change in consumer behavior on stock-up trips. Whereas once upon a time, it was to our advantage to promote with large multiples, today, we've adjusted that to -- we still have aggressive programs, but they're in multiples of 2 or 3 to reflect that kind of behavior. So consumers are definitely shopping closer to consumption. And in terms of the inventory, as we said, the inventory levels today coming into the quarter were lower than they were a year ago.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Yes, I would just add to that. If you look at the end of the quarter, we're probably -- I think we are at multi-year lows in terms of absolute levels of inventory.","B. Craig Owens","Having entered the quarter at a high level, so that there's quite a swing from beginning to end.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Greg Hessler with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had a balance sheet-related question. I think, on the last earnings call, you had indicated that you expected the total debt balance to be down in 2014, and there was a little bit of an uptick on a sequential basis. Can you just provide some color on why the debt balance increased?","B. Craig Owens","Because of the acquisition of Kelsen and Plum. Kelsen, yes, is the one that's in the quarter, right?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Yes, and keep in mind that the sale of the European simple meals business occurred in the first day of the second quarter. So obviously, our debt level is down since then.","B. Craig Owens","So we don't have proceeds -- we'll show proceeds from the European sale in the second quarter.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. And then, so on a -- I guess, if we're looking at it, we should compare -- your total debt balance at year end for 2014 should theoretically be lower than that $4.4 billion or $4.5 billion number at the end of the 2013. Is that the way to look at it?","B. Craig Owens","Yes, absolutely.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more, if I could squeeze it in. I mean, you guys have a decent-sized short-term debt balance, and you have a couple of maturities coming up. Do you guys expect that you'll be in the debt capital markets this year?","B. Craig Owens","We don't -- we haven't made any announcement about that. As you saw, we -- the last bond that matured, we paid off, and we'll evaluate that as we come up. I think we've got 2. They actually fall into 2 different fiscal years, but they're right at the beginning of August of 2014, so I -- probably, at that point, at least one of those would be partially refunded by a new issue.","Jennifer K.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ken Gosnell, Vice President Finance Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ken Gosnell","Thank you, Candice. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup\u2019s fiscal 2017. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO.","As usual, we\u2019ve created slides to accompany our earnings presentation.

We plan to release earnings on November 21, 2017, February 16, 2018, May 18, 2018, and August 30, 2018.","With that, let me turn the call over to Denise.","Denise Morrison","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter call. Today, I\u2019ll focus my remarks on the marketplace, our performance, our plans and our outlook for fiscal 2018.","As we\u2019ve discussed previously, the operating environment remains challenging across the food industry. While macro economic conditions in the U.S. continue to improve in the quarter, the seismic shifts we\u2019ve described in the past continue to alter the consumer food and retail landscapes. These disruptions include shifting demographics, changing consumer preferences for food with a focus on fresh and health and well-being and increase snacking behavior, a range of socioeconomic forces and technology advancements that are reshaping the consumer shopping experience.","Additionally, there is no denying that the retailer landscape is changing dramatically with the emergence of new players, new store formats, and evolving business models. Several variables are at play, including value players expanding their presence in the U.S., the growth of store brands and the explosion of e-commerce and meal delivery services disrupting the market. We expect conditions to remain hypercompetitive for the foreseeable future.","In this environment what is Campbell doing to compete differently? First, we\u2019re prioritizing investments, aligning our resources to future growth areas and creating opportunities from the disruptions in the market. To our growth agenda, we\u2019re focusing on four strategic imperatives to strengthen our core business and at the same time expand in the faster growing spaces.","Second, we\u2019ve redesigned our retailer selling and support capabilities in June of fiscal 2017. Our new integrated structure aligns our sales and marketing resources to drive growth with existing customers and to pursue business in new channels. We\u2019re rethinking our approach to collaborating with key customers around platform merchandising, such as health and well-being and snacking.","We\u2019re enhancing our data-driven shopper insights. And through our strategic foresights work, we\u2019re better positioned to drive innovation and customization across both the perimeter and in the center store. Most customers have welcomed this new level of engagement and collaboration.","Third, we\u2019ve established a distinct digital e-commerce business unit to address both pure play and omni-channel opportunities.","Finally, we believe that investing to differentiate our brands is the best way to appeal to consumers and build loyalty in a crowded market. Make no mistakes, these shifts are accelerating and converging and they\u2019re having a dramatic impact on Campbell and across the industry. In this environment, sales growth remains challenging.","With this as a backdrop, our performance in the quarter was mixed. Organic sales declined 1%, while adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, both increased double-digits. Despite multiple headwinds, we finished fiscal 2017 within our guidance and delivered another year of growth in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS.","For the fourth quarter, our Global Biscuits and Snacks performance was slightly below what I would have liked in terms of the top line, but the team delivered a double-digit earnings increase versus the year-ago quarter.","Americas Simple Meals and Beverages continued to deliver against its portfolio role, with sales performance in line with the categories in which we compete and margin expansion. I\u2019m not happy with our performance in Campbell Fresh, but remain encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made this year to address our key executional issues.","C-Fresh delivered modest sales growth and we expect this business to return to profitable growth in fiscal 2018. Let me now offer my perspective on each division\u2019s performance and highlight our plans for fiscal 2018, starting with Global Biscuits and Snacks.","Overall, I\u2019m satisfied with the performance of the division in the quarter. Organic sales were comparable to a year ago, with expected gains in Pepperidge Farm, but below my expectations in Arnott\u2019s due to our performance in Indonesia. Importantly, the business delivered a double-digit increase in operating earnings.","I\u2019m particularly pleased with the performance of Pepperidge Farm snacks, especially the Goldfish brand, which once again delivered strong sales results. In the quarter, growth was fueled by larger pack sizes. Over an extended period of time, this team has delivered a steady cadence of innovation and effective marketing programs, while also expanding the brand\u2019s health and well-being credentials with organic and whole grain offerings.","I\u2019m also enthusiastic about the launch of our new Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse Cookie line, a thin crispy cookie made with simple ingredients. Farmhouse is on track to be the biggest Pepperidge Farm snack launch in more than a decade.","In Australia, the team delivered growth in biscuits behind the return to the original version of Arnott\u2019s Shapes crackers. Additionally, our new Tim Tam gelato-inspired varieties performed well. Segment operating earnings increased 35%, as a result of our strong enabler program, a return to more normal marketing levels and reduced administrative costs.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect to grow sales in Global Biscuits and Snacks. In Pepperidge Farm, we intend to dial up our real food and health and well-being efforts by emphasizing our goodness credentials. New snacking consumer insights will also shape how we connect with our consumers develop new packaging formats and adapt to new retail environments.","In particular, we have plans to extend Goldfish to older kids, a new demographic for the brand. We\u2019ll continue to execute the successful marketing strategy that has led to both sales and share gains this year by investing behind our proven Milano Moments\u2019 campaign. We also plan to build on the successful launch of Farmhouse Cookies and drive increased trial of Tim Tam biscuits in the U.S. from both traditional retailers and e-commerce channels.","In Australia, we have plans to strengthen our core with new varieties of Shapes crackers, expand our health and well-being offerings with new Arnott\u2019s Vita-Wheat cracker chips and Cruskits products, drive on-the-go snacking with a variety of new multi-pack single serve products, and we recently launched an integrated Arnott\u2019s master brand advertising campaign to support the business.","Turning now to Campbell Fresh. I\u2019m not satisfied with the performance this quarter, but I\u2019m optimistic that our key executional issues are now largely behind us. In the fourth quarter, Campbell Fresh returned to growth with a modest 1% increase in sales, driven by Garden Fresh Gourmet in our farms business. However, sales in the beverage business declined slightly as we continue to deal with capacity constraints, largely due to newly enhanced quality processes we put in place, both in our plant and with our new co-packer.","As we previously said, we began increasing promotional activity towards the end of the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect to ramp up to normal promotional levels during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Let me be clear, I\u2019m disappointed with the operating loss in Campbell Fresh this quarter, which reflects a number of costs that are one-time in nature, including higher carrot costs, as well as increased expenses to further refine our new quality protocols.","We have plans underway to increase efficiencies as part of our overall effort to eliminate supply constraints and improve margins, while delivering our new higher-quality standards. As I said before, we\u2019ve learned some tough lessons in C-Fresh. Despite the executional challenges, we remain confident in the growth potential of the Packaged Fresh category, and believe our C-Fresh strategy is sound. Throughout fiscal 2017, we took steps to build a stronger foundation for growth under our new C-Fresh leadership team.","Looking ahead, we plan for the business to grow profitably in fiscal 2018, as we return to more normal capacity and promotional activity across the beverage portfolio. We also have a robust innovation pipeline to help fuel additional growth and we\u2019ll begin to introduce new beverage products to the market, such as plant protein milk. We also plan to expand distribution of Garden Fresh Gourmet sauces and fresh soup.","Finally, our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. Similar to other center store categories, sales declined. Organic sales decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by soup and V8 beverages. Operating earnings increased 4%.","Let me start with our shelf stable beverage business. Sales declined in the quarter. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, the entire shelf stable beverage category has been hurt by ongoing consumer concerns about sugar and calories, and by consumer shopping the store perimeter for fresh juices and other functional beverages. These trends continue to negatively impact our V8 portfolio, in particular, V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash.","However, V8 100% Vegetable Juice and V8 +Energy continue to meet the demands of consumers seeking beverages that deliver health and well-being benefit. In the quarter, consumption of V8 Vegetable Juice increase behind our ongoing media investment, focused on our core baby boomer consumers and we expanded distribution of V8 +Energy.","Looking ahead, as discussed at our Investor Day, we have a clear strategy to improve performance of the V8 brand with continued focus on V8 Vegetable Juice, the revitalization of V8 Blends with new benefits focused messaging on the front of the label and steady growth V8 +Energy. While our performance will improve, we do not expect this business to return to growth in fiscal 2018.","Now let\u2019s turn to soup. As you know, this was a relatively small quarter for U.S. soup. While consumer takeaway was consistent with a year ago, soup sales declined 4%, all of which was related to lower retailer inventory levels. For the year, U.S. soup sales declined 1%, while sales of condensed soup and broth declined, I\u2019m pleased with the growth of our ready-to-serve portfolio, including Chunky, Slow Kettle and the meaningful contribution from the successful mid-year launch of our new Well Yes! line.","We\u2019ve modified our outlook for 2018 in U.S. soup, since we spoke in July for sales, as we now expect additional headwinds, let me explain. As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the retailer landscape is changing dramatically amidst intense competitive activity. Each year, we enter a set of complex negotiations with our key retail partners. Our goal is to drive growth, both for our customers and for Campbell. Unfortunately, this year we\u2019ve been unable to reach an agreement with a large customer on a promotional program for soup.","We expect this will negatively impact our U.S. soup sales with this customer, particularly in the first-half Accordingly, we now expect our soup sales to decline in fiscal 2018. We are taking a number of steps to mitigate the profit risk, and of course, we\u2019re continuing discussions with this customer to create a win-win solution.","We believe, our fiscal 2018 soup lineup and promotional programs are strong, and we\u2019re pleased that, they\u2019ve been well received in the balance of the marketplace. For the upcoming soup season, we\u2019ll build on the continued launch of Well Yes! Soup and introduced five new varieties. We have compelling brand partnerships with popular movie franchise to drive our kids\u2019 soups. We\u2019re rolling out innovation in Swanson broth.","We have robust holiday plans across the portfolio. We\u2019re launching the New Chunky Maxx line with 40% more protein, and we have strong integrated marketing, including a New Chunky campaign that fully leverages our NFL sponsorship. We\u2019ll continue to work closely with all of our customers to maximize the sales opportunity during the upcoming soup season.","And now a quick update on the pending acquisition of Pacific Foods. You may have seen recent media reports regarding a lawsuit involving the estate of one of the co-founders in Pacific. Campbell is not named in the suit and we\u2019re not going to comment on the litigation.","We remain enthusiastic about Pacific. It will add another purpose-driven brand, with a track record of growth to our portfolio. We\u2019re working to resolve outstanding issues, so that we may complete this transaction in the coming months.","A highlight for fiscal 2017 was our successful multi-year cost savings initiative. As announced this year, we increased our target by $150 million and now expect to deliver $450 million in savings by the end of fiscal 2020. We remain committed to managing costs aggressively and reinvesting a portion of the savings back into the business in fiscal 2018 to position the company for long-term growth.","As we outlined in July, we\u2019re focusing our investments on our four strategic imperatives, as we believe, these areas will be future growth drivers of our business.","First, as I mentioned earlier, we created a new e-commerce business unit to scale our capabilities across North America, including content creation, data analytics and forging new partnerships. Expanding our e-commerce organization is critical to capture more than our fair share of the rapidly growing market for online grocery, which we expect to reach $66 billion annually by 2021. We\u2019re in a good position to do so with experienced digital and e-commerce leadership in place and a solid strategy to develop new capabilities.","Second, we\u2019re targeting increased investment in snacking, as consumers continue to seek new and better-for-you snacking options. The snacking market is worth approximately $125 billion in the U.S. alone and growing around 3%. We plan to invest in people and resources to expand our business beyond cookies and baked snacks to other snacking and mini meal categories.","Third, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our real food credentials in our core business; including adding more vegetables and whole grains; converting all our soups to chicken with no antibiotics, while continuing to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from our products and completing the removal of BPA from the lining of our cans in the U.S. and Canada.","Finally, in the health and well-being space, we plan to invest across the company, focusing on food with attributes such as natural, organic, functional and fresh. Additionally, for the longer-term, we\u2019ll continue to fund Habit, our personalized nutrition start-up. We\u2019re applying the learnings from our successful beta test in San Francisco, as we expand the service nationally. We continue to expect multiple business models to emerge that ultimately will create value.","These four strategic imperatives represent significant growth potential for Campbell, as we continue to differentiate our company and our brands over time. The rapidly evolving marketplace requires new approaches and smart investment to engage with new and existing customers to make our brands more relevant to new generations of consumers, while satisfying our loyal core consumers and to explore new models of innovation. This longer-term view sometimes comes at the expense of shorter-term performance.","We have our eye on the long-term targets, as we continue to believe that they are attainable. However, to achieve them, we must further invest to diversify our portfolio towards the faster-growing consumer spaces of health and well-being and snacking, while increasing our participation in the growing e-commerce space. And we must do this, while raising the bar on transparency and making our food more real and more sustainable.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect sales growth in both Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell\u2019s Fresh. However, we expect sales to decline in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As I outlined earlier, U.S. soup sales will be negatively impacted by lower promotional support with a large customer.","Additionally, we do not expect our V8 beverage business to grow in fiscal 2018. Given the difficult operating environment, the outlook for our Americas division and our plan to invest back in the business for the long-term, we expect net sales to change by minus 2% to 0%, adjusted EBIT to change by minus 1% to plus 1%, and adjusted EPS to change by 0% to plus 2%, this guidance excludes the pending acquisition of Pacific Foods. Anthony will walk you through additional details during his remarks.","In closing, across the industry, the pace of change and disruption continues to accelerate. We expect the operating environment to remain challenging in fiscal 2018. Campbell is prepared to address the short-term challenges we\u2019re facing, and make the necessary investments to position the company for long-term growth. Our purpose, growth agenda and strategic imperatives provide the guide as we take the steps to be the leading health and well-being food company.","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter. Importantly, as you saw in our press release this morning, we finished fiscal 2017 with performance consistent with our most recent guidance.","I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made against our $450 million cost saving target by 2020. We ended 2017 with program to-date savings of $325 million. Cost savings together with productivity gains have contributed to another year of gross margin expansion.","We are disappointed with the performance of the Campbell Fresh division. As we\u2019ve said, we believe that we have the right strategy for this business. We are addressing the executional issues, and we look forward to returning this business to top and bottom line growth in 2018. We are providing guidance for 2018, which is below our long-term target.","As I\u2019ll discuss, we have not been able to reach agreement on the promotional program with a key customer in our U.S. soup business and anticipate this to have a negative impact on sales. In terms of EBIT performance, while we expect to generate incremental cost savings and drive gross margin expansion, we are increasing our level of reinvestment in the business. I\u2019ll discuss the factors impacting the guidance in my remarks.","Now I\u2019ll review our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, as reported net sales declined by 1% to $1.664 billion. Organic sales also declined by 1%, reflecting declines in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment. Adjusted EBIT increased 11% to $282 million, reflecting on an adjusted basis, lower marketing and selling expenses and a higher gross margin percentage, partly offset by the sales decline. Adjusted EPS increased 13%, or $0.06 to $0.52 per share.","For the full-year, both as reported and organic net sales declined to 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT increased 2% compared to the prior year, driven by a higher adjusted gross margin percentage and lower adjusted administrative expenses, which benefited from lower incentive compensation costs, partly offset by lower sales volume, and adjusted EPS benefiting from share repurchases increased 3% to $3.04.","Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by lower volume, primarily in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, reflecting the impact of a lower retailer inventory levels on soup sales and declines in V8 beverages. Overall, promotional spending rates were comparable to the prior year, as increases in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages were offset by lower rates in Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh.","Within Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, promotional spending rates were up in Canada to hold key promoted prices following our list price increase and also in V8 beverages. In Global Biscuits and Snacks, promotional rate reductions were primarily driven by lower levels of spending in Arnott\u2019s biscuits. And in C-Fresh, promotional activity remains lower, as we manage through our beverage supply constraints.","And although it rounds to zero on the chart, we did have a slightly positive impact from currency translation, principally the Australian dollar bringing the change in our as reported sales to minus 1%.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased 80 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 110 basis points. On a rate basis, cost inflation was about 1.5%. And in Campbell Fresh, we experienced higher care costs and costs related to beverage supply constraints and enhanced quality protocols. These negative drivers were partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiative and mark-to-market gains on open commodity contracts. Promotional spending, mix and pricing had little to no impact on the quarter.","Lastly, our supply chain productivity program, which is incremental to our cost savings program contributed 180 basis points of margin improvement. All in, our adjusted gross margin percentage expanded 80 basis points to 36.9%.","Adjusted marketing and selling expenses declined 12% in the quarter, primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, as we lap the prior year quarter in which marketing levels were significantly above historical levels. We are also benefiting from our cost savings initiative. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 5%, reflecting the benefit from our cost savings initiatives.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line item. Adjusted EPS increased $0.06 from $0.46 in the prior-year quarter to $0.52 per share in the current quarter. On a currency neutral basis, the improvement in adjusted EBIT had a $0.06 impact on the EPS.","Share repurchases reduced our share count, adding $0.01 EPS benefit. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter increased by 80 basis points to 37.2%. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter reflects an unfavorable timing impact, as well as the geographic mix of earnings. This was partly offset by lapping the negative impact of $13 million correction for deferred tax expense in the prior year. The higher tax rate reduced adjusted EPS by $0.01.","As expected, the adjusted tax rate for the full-year was 32.4%. And while adjusted interest expense was up $1 million, as higher rates were mostly offset by lower average debt, this had no impact on EPS for the quarter. Currency translation also had no impact on EPS, completing the bridge to $0.52 per share.","Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales declined 3%, driven primarily by declines in soup and V8 beverages. Sales of U.S. soup in this non-seasonal quarter declined 4%, reflecting declines in condensed, broth and ready-to-serve. The lower sales were driven by reductions in retailer inventory levels, while consumer takeaway in measured channels was comparable to a year ago.","For the full-year, sales of U.S. soup declined 1%, as declines in condensed and broth were partly offset by growth of ready-to-serve soups. Operating earnings increased 4% in the quarter to $198 million. The increase was primarily driven by lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses and lower administrative expenses, partly offset by lower sales volume and a lower gross margin percentage.","Here\u2019s a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results, as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending July 30, 2017, the category as a whole declined 40 basis points. Our sales performance was better than a category, declining just 10 basis points.","We had a 58.8% market share for the 52-week period, and as we outperformed the category, we gained 20 basis points of market share. Our share gains and ready-to-serve reflected improved performance with Chunky and the launch of Well Yes!, and were mostly offset by lower share in broth, which was impacted by increased private label activity. Private label grew share by 130 basis points, finishing at 14.1%. All other branded players collectively had a share of about 27%, declining 150 basis points.","In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales were comparable to the prior year, as gains in Pepperidge Farm, reflecting continued growth in Goldfish crackers, were offset by a decline in our Arnott\u2019s business in Indonesia. Operating earnings increased 35% to $109 million, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses and lower administrative expense.","In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales increased 1%, driven primarily by higher sales of Garden Fresh Gourmet and Bolthouse Farms carrots and carrot ingredients. Sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages declined slightly, reflecting the impact of supply constraints.","Looking ahead with increasing internal capacity and additional co-packer capacity now coming online, we expect to have sufficient capacity to support our growth plan in fiscal 2018. Operating earnings decreased from $8 million to a loss of $8 million, reflecting higher administrative expenses, higher carrot costs and the cost impact of further improvements in our quality processes and related beverage capacity constraints.","Operating earnings in the fourth quarter are below our year-to-date run rate, reflecting additional costs, primarily related to one-time inventory and asset write-offs. While not to the record level generated last year, we had another strong year in cash flow performance. Cash from operations was $1.291 million, compared to $1.491 million in 2016. The decline was due to wrapping last year\u2019s working capital reduction, lower cash earnings and lower receipts on hedging activities.","Capital expenditures ended the year at $338 million, about equal to last year. We paid dividends totaling $420 million, compared to $390 million in 2016. The increase reflects our 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share earlier in this fiscal year.","In aggregate, we repurchased $437 million of shares in fiscal 2017, $400 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt of $3.2 billion was comparable to last year, as cash from operations was offset by capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases.","Now, I\u2019ll review our 2018 outlook. We expect sales to change by minus 2% to 0%, adjusted EBIT to change by minus 1% to plus 1% and adjusted EPS to change by 0% to plus 2%. This guidance assumes that the impact of currency translation will be nominal. We are forecasting sales growth in both Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. However, we expect sales in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages to decline.","As Denise discussed, we expect U.S. soup sales to be negatively impacted by lower promotional support with a key customer. We currently estimate the impact to be about 1 percentage point on total company sales. And while we expect to make progress in turning around our V8 Beverage business, we do not expect growth in 2018.","While adjusted EBIT is benefiting from our cost savings program and productivity improvements, we are increasing the level of reinvestment in the business to drive long-term growth. As we discussed at our Investor Day meeting, we are investing in e-commerce, snacking, real food and our health and well-being initiatives. We are also forecasting an increase in the rate of cost inflation and face an incentive compensation headwind representing 2 percentage points of EBIT.","Adjusted EPS reflects the anticipated benefit from our strategic share repurchase program, partly offset by higher interest expense. And although, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect significantly weaker performance in the first-half and relatively better performance in the second-half of this fiscal year.","Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, we have seen an increase in cost inflation. Looking ahead to 2018, we are forecasting cost inflation in the range of 2% to 3%, driven by ingredient and packaging increases on dairy, wheat, steel cans, resins and corrugated. Cost inflation also includes higher wages and medical benefit costs.","As we\u2019ve successfully delivered in the past, we expect ongoing supply chain productivity gains, excluding the benefit of our cost savings program of approximately 3% of cost of products sold. Against our cost savings program, we expect to deliver an additional $60 million to $70 million of cost savings, most of which will impact costs.","With productivity and cost savings ahead of inflation, we expect to deliver a modest improvement in our gross margin percentage. Below the line, our adjusted interest expense is expected to increase to approximate $120 million to $130 million, reflecting the impact from our sale of intercompany notes to a third-party bank in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.","We expect this effective tax rate to be approximately 32% slightly below the 2017 rate of 32.4%. We expect to continue buying back shares under our strategic share repurchase program. However, given the pending Pacific Foods acquisition, we anticipate the level of repurchases will be below 2017 level.","Lastly, we are forecasting capital expenditures of approximately $400 million, which is an increase from 2017 spending, reflecting our recently announced initiative to build a forward-deployed warehousing and distribution system in the U.S.","That concludes my remarks. And I\u2019ll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Anthony. We will now start Q&A session. Since we have limited time, out of fairness to the other callers, please ask only one question at a time.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Okay, Candice.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Denise Morrison","Good morning, Andrew.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi. Denise, I have a question, I guess, on the fiscal 2018 outlook more broadly that that pertains to Campbell, but obviously some other food names too that they have sort of similar fiscal years and have recently provided their own sort of 2018 guidance.","I guess, the pattern that has emerged is still some expectation of sales growth that will be below what we all like to see, given the tough environment that you\u2019ve talked about, but still some earnings growth, given the flow through of cost saves and such. And I guess, in Campbell\u2019s case, the company has made some very big bets around growth to your assets within C-Fresh and Snacking.","And I guess, I wonder, if you\u2019ve talked about reinvestment this year, but I guess, just in consideration to maybe spending even much more upfront to realize the promise of these growth areas even if it means, let\u2019s say, lower EPS for a year or two in order to revive the top line maybe more sustainably, even I know, that\u2019s not a super pleasant thought process.","I guess, my question is really around the concept of reinvestment versus a rebase from an EPS standpoint, just so we don\u2019t run the risk of maybe repeating as a group this sort of scenario over time?","Denise Morrison","Andrew, you raised a very good point and it\u2019s always a very thoughtful process to balance the performance in the short-term with significant long-term investments. In this environment and for the last several years, we have been acting very decisively and aggressively. When you think about it, we bought five companies in the last five years. If you include the pending acquisition of Pacific, we divested lower performing businesses.","We have closed several manufacturing facilities and consolidated assets and giving \u2013 give \u2013 invested to give us much more flexibility and cost savings in our supply chain. We\u2019ve realized our cost savings program over delivering the $300 million a year early and setting a goal for another $150 million, which we have a line of sight to. And we\u2019ve really amped up new models of innovation going into places that we haven\u2019t gone before.","So we haven\u2019t been sitting still for a moment. And this continued stream of investment is on top of all of that activity. And we believe that the investments that we\u2019re making really \u2013 are in sufficient support in 2018 to get these ideas jumpstarted and\/or continue to invest where we have already been activating. And so I\u2019m comfortable with the fact that, it\u2019s the right level of investment and we\u2019re still able to show some EPS and EBIT growth in the process.","Andrew Lazar","Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you And our next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Grainger","Great. Thanks.. Hi, Denise, good morning. I just \u2013 I know this is probably a difficult one to elaborate on. But I wanted to come back to the negotiation issue that you highlighted in the soup category, given the importance of soup to your overall profitability and supply chain. I\u2019m just curious if you can give us any more context on why you felt it was necessary to exercise this level of discipline and really sort of stand on principle here?","Is that a function of that particular retailer making unrealistic demands? And how do you think about the risks of that translating into other categories, or potentially a loss of shelf space, or display that\u2019s hard to rectify going forward?","Denise Morrison","Yes, we don\u2019t necessarily comment on the specifics with a customer, but let me answer the question more in aggregate. Our negotiations with customers for soup season involve joint business planning with plans for spending and merchandising linked to a sales goal. And what we seek are win-win-win solutions, win for the consumer, win for the customer and win for Campbell.","And so, in this particular situation, we were not able to achieve that negotiation. And so what I can tell you though is, our programs are strong, our A&C investment is robust and our new products are really unique with the Well Yes! and Chunky Maxx. And they\u2019ve been really well received by customers in general in the marketplace, and we will continue to keep the dialogue open and strive for that win-win-win solution.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, understood. And I\u2019m not sure if these factors are related just a quick follow-up. But is the trade inventory reduction that occurred in Q4 have anything to do with just sort of the lead into to the fall and changes with that same customer, or is that something a bit broader across the retail environment?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, I would say, they\u2019re unrelated, Matt.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, great. Thanks, both.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is now open.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi, David.","Denise Morrison","Hi, David.","David Driscoll","I wanted just to go back a little bit, so the Analyst Day I walked away from Analyst Day really thinking that you were quite optimistic about the situation that it was changing Denise in a positive way. So the negative 2% to 0% revenue guidance comping a negative 1% from the year. It\u2019s pretty disappointing. But it doesn\u2019t even seem like it\u2019s all related to this.","Anthony, I think, you said the impact from this soup issue is negative 1 percentage point. But \u2013 so can you just comment on the fullness of this guidance? Is there something else here, because negative 2% to 0%, it doesn\u2019t seem to flip to some of the stuff that I thought you were saying at Analyst Day about the turnaround in C-Fresh and these opportunities in biscuits. I just feel like we were getting a bit more negative of a figure today and maybe it\u2019s not only related to the soup issue, but would just love for you to elaborate if you can?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. So if I think about it in its components, we \u2013 and as Denise said, we do expect to see top line growth in Campbell Fresh in 2018, as we get the capacity for beverage back up to where we need to be. We turn on the promotional program, that\u2019s kind of happening now as we speak, so we do expect growth there. We do expect growth in Global Biscuits and Snacks. The Pepperidge Farm business driven by Goldfish has performed well, so we expect that to continue.","Fresh Bakery is a little bit of a drag on that portfolio. Frozen is a little bit of a drag on that portfolio. Arnott\u2019s, we expect a little bit of growth and we expect to turnaround or stabilize our business in Indonesia. So I would say, in Global Biscuits and Snacks a little bit of growth.","As you pointed out on Americas Simple Meals and Beverages two negative drivers. One is now the issue on U.S. soup and the other is the expected decline although hopefully to a lesser degree on our V8 Beverage businesses. So, that gets into negative territory in aggregate. And I think the range reflects some expectation and some realization of the environment in which we\u2019re operating. And that\u2019s how we came to a decision to go down to that minus 2 as to the lower end of the range so.","David Driscoll","One follow-up on the specific issue. Just to be clear, it\u2019s a promotion problem that you\u2019re having for the soup season. It sounds then that, is this a true statement you\u2019ve not been delisted, you\u2019ve not lost shelf space. You\u2019re just not getting the promotions that you would have otherwise expected to get during the soup season, is that fair?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, that is fair. So it\u2019ll show up in the financials. It will look like a reduction in trade and a lower trade rate that will flow through to lower volumes, which we think will off \u2013 or more than offset the trade reduction. So, therefore, lower sales. It will have some negative impacts on EBIT and we\u2019re looking for ways to mitigate the bottom line impact through incremental cost savings and a redeployment of some of that trade elsewhere.","David Driscoll","Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it along.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Denise Morrison","Hi, ken.","Ken Goldman","Hi, thanks so much. Hey, good morning.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi, Ken.","Ken Goldman","If I can just ask a quick one on soup and then a more general follow-up on soup. Just on the timing, thank you for that help in terms of, you mentioned first-half. I\u2019m just curious, does it start to affect your business? I\u2019m just talking the loss of the promotion in the first quarter, or is it more of a second quarter issue? Why doesn\u2019t it affect the third quarter as much? I\u2019m just trying to get a little bit of sense of timing as we sort of model this out? I\u2019ll leave it there and then I\u2019ll go to the follow-up if I can?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s two things. One is the seasonality of soup. So it is going to impact both the first quarter and then the second quarter. And the reason that you don\u2019t see it\u2019s less so in the back-half is how the in-season and out of season pricing works on soup. So the big delta that you\u2019ll see on shelf prices is really up first-half in-season issue and not so much when we get out of season in the back-half.","Ken Goldman","Okay. But exclusive of seasonality, we should start modeling this fairly immediately in 1Q. Is that the message we should takeaway, or is it unclear exactly when this sort of?","Anthony DiSilvestro","No, I would agree with that.","Ken Goldman","Yes, okay. And then just my follow-up is, we\u2019ve heard some of your peers talk about the more challenging negotiating environment with customers in general. One individual said, it\u2019s not like it was 20 years ago where you just send a fax out and announce a price increase, it\u2019s a lot harder than it used to be. I think, that\u2019s apparent. But I\u2019m just questioning or curious rather for this particular issue with the loss promo, do you look at it as a real one-off, I guess, challenge to you, or is this indicative of a more difficult environment out there something that you may have to deal with a little bit longer and more broadly in the future?","Denise Morrison","Yes. Yes, I think that the \u2013 again, as I said, I think the retailer environment right now is hypercompetitive. I mean, you\u2019ve got the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods, the expansion of Leadle and Aldie, creating some new retail formats and some escalated competition in the marketplace.","However, I\u2019m optimistic that retail continues to morph. I mean, I remember and I\u2019m going way back when club stores and supercenters were a new format. And the retailer market and companies like ours adjust to that. So we\u2019re really focused on making our brands accessible in multiple channels, and we believe that the new sales design that we have will help us in that effort.","So, yes, I do think these are challenging times. And I do think that, as the consumer changes, retailers will change with the consumer and we\u2019ve got to do the same.","Ken Goldman","Thanks. Have a good holiday.","Anthony DiSilvestro","You too.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Denise Morrison","Hello, Bryan.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hello, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Just a question on snack investments. I think, you had mentioned that it was one of the themes in the Investor Day in July and you\u2019ve referenced it again today on the call. So, Denise, can you just sort of give us a little bit more color in terms of the type of investments? Would it be \u2013 are you considering maybe more M&A in the Snacking world? Is it packaging formats, launching new products? Just trying to get a sense for, I guess, what we should look for in terms of being able to identify where you\u2019ve sort of expanded in snacking and what those types of investments would be?","Denise Morrison","Right. So in the snacking area, I\u2019ll take it in three parts. The first is our internal innovation. And we have real insights about the frequency of consumer snacking and mini meal consumption now five times a day as opposed to only about a third of the population eating three square meals. So we think that\u2019s a very rich space for us to expand with our brands internally.","So we have a concerted effort across the enterprise to really look at the \u2013 a series of platforms that we\u2019ve identified and bring health and well-being more into the front and center on snacking, starting with mindful kids snacking, which we think is a good base for us. So the investment is really in the people and resources to amp up that internal innovation.","The second part of it is partnerships, and we\u2019re continuing to look at partnerships like Chef\u2019d, for example, where we can actually incorporate our brands into new models and accessible channels.","And then the third would be, smart M&A. And we continue to be very disciplined about the M&A that we do and this will be no different. But this is an area, where we have an interest, particularly in the better-for-you snacking arena. So it\u2019s really a three-pronged approach, but we do believe that\u2019s a very robust space for us as a company across the enterprise.","Bryan Spillane","If I remember correctly, you\u2019ve set revenue targets over, I guess, maybe the medium-term for each segment to sort of gain incremental revenue from snacking. Is \u2013 do you expect that in this fiscal 2018 that there will be some incremental revenue in 2018 from these initiatives?","Denise Morrison","Yes. I think that\u2019s built into the growth expectations for the Global Biscuits and Snacks Division, and some of the innovations that we will be developing will also be hitting the marketplace in future years.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, great. Thanks. Have a great holiday weekend.","Denise Morrison","Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","You too, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning.","Jonathan Feeney","Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. You had a little break there. So let me get back to the \u2013 just one more follow-up please, on the major customer soup decision here. Is this just a simple, I mean, you said you didn\u2019t lose shelf space. Is this just as simple as a competitive issue that maybe surprised you a little bit, where someone else is selling in promotional aggressively and that\u2019s maybe a little surprising giving some of the recent plant moves that have been made? Is there any truth to that statement?","Denise Morrison","I\u2019m comfortable that we\u2019ve given you the information that we\u2019re willing to disclose. So, beyond that, I don\u2019t believe we should be talking about the details.","Jonathan Feeney","Okay. Let me take it this way then. Your other nine of your top 10 customers where this didn\u2019t happen, what are the factors when you think about the soup season that like what data do you provide them? What are the factors that that you\u2019re very excited about that allow you to maybe keep the kind of promotions you\u2019ve been \u2013 you have there? I mean, is it, why wouldn\u2019t \u2013 what do you \u2013 what data do you share with them that make those negotiations go well?","Denise Morrison","Yes, we have a very disciplined robust process with our customers in joint business planning, which starts with discovery of opportunities, development of ideas, decisions made and then delivery and execution. And so, we have been working on these joint business plans for many years with many customers. They really involve things like pricing merchandising shelves, performance, consumer activation, customization, packaging, product assortment, they\u2019re very, very comprehensive strategic plans that we co-develop with our customers. And we have very strong programs this year and very robust plans with customers. So I\u2019m optimistic with this other one situation that we will get to a win-win solution.","Jonathan Feeney","Okay. Thank you very much.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Jason.","Jason English","Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. Hello, hello, hope I understood you well. I\u2019m going to follow-up on Feeney\u2019s question, because I feel the need. The issue with the soup promotion maybe you\u2019re willing to disclose whether or not it was a retailer choosing to opt into other categories, so no longer showing the same degree of support behind soup. Is that the issue here, or is it kind of Feeney\u2019s question, no, no, it\u2019s just a different brand within soup that they\u2019re going to promote this year?","Denise Morrison","We\u2019re not experiencing this in other categories.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, I guess, it\u2019s really hard for us to tell you what the retailer\u2019s promotional program it is going to be in the category. We know what it is vis-\u00e0-vis our product. It\u2019s hard for us to sit here and say, we know what they\u2019re going to do with respect to the other brands within this category. I will add this situation with this retailer is unique to the soup category and not to the other categories in which we participate even with this retailer. So it is confined to soup, and again, it\u2019s really hard for us to say what that retailer is going to do.","Jason English","Okay. So the jury is still out on whether or not they\u2019re just pulling back on the category in aggregate, wait and see there. Let me ask you a different question. And kind of taken the other side of Andrew Lazar\u2019s question on, do you need to spend more and ask the question of, are you spending way too much on this portfolio? You\u2019re talking about a big capital investment for services, but arguably there\u2019s ample third-party capacity out there. But you\u2019re going to \u2013 you\u2019ll burn a lot of cash to replicate that. And you continue, I mean, you pull back a lot on A&P, but the spend level isn\u2019t necessarily anemic in context of the industry.","Denise, given the seismic shifts and the acceleration of these shifts, all the things you\u2019re talking about, why aren\u2019t you making more seismic shifts? Why aren\u2019t pulling back, shoring up more cash to really accelerate this portfolio pivot and transformation outside of just sort of these smaller bolt-on incremental moves that you\u2019ve been pursuing for the last few years?","Denise Morrison","We believe that we have the right balance of strengthening our core business and at the same time expanding into faster growing spaces. So, again, we believe that we are spending adequately and aggressively in our Global Biscuits and Snacks in our Campbell Fresh business to build those very on-trend categories.","Just a reminder, though, the soup business is still a very large and profitable business for us, and we have to keep our brands differentiated and relevant. And so we\u2019ve been really investing very specifically in the real food credentials of our core business to better satisfy consumers and customers and innovation to keep the center store robust, which is definitely needed in today\u2019s environment.","We \u2013 that said, we have had really good margin expansion in the category and we\u2019re operating as a company very profitably. So, I do think that if there are M&A opportunities out there that we can bolt-on or supplement what we\u2019re doing, we are open to that, but we\u2019re again, very disciplined about our approach to that.","Jason English","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Denise Morrison","Hi, David.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi, David.","David Palmer","Good morning. Just a quick one on, you mentioned in the opening remarks, retailer brands as part of the description of the challenges facing food producers out there. In the past, you talked about retailer brand pushed in broth. Could you just talk about retailer brands and the threat toward the market share shifts that are going on there vis-\u00e0-vis broth and particularly as it relates to your fiscal 2018 outlook? Thanks.","Denise Morrison","Yes. Private label has definitely been around for a long time and has traditionally been below average share in our categories. And acknowledging the fact that we did feel the impact on Swanson broth this year. We believe in a world of private label that the best insulation is brand differentiation and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.","And so, and the other \u2013 the flip side of it is, in the Fresh business, we do participate with store brands in some of our fresh categories. So it\u2019s not a one size fits all on how to work in an environment with private label.","David Palmer","So do you feel like you\u2019ve \u2013 with broth, in particularly, you\u2019ve stabilized things versus private label and you have the right programs to make sure that those share trends are, at least, not going to get worse?","Denise Morrison","Yes, we have specific plans to differentiate broth this year.","David Palmer","Great. Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Ken Gosnell for any closing remarks.","Ken Gosnell","Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining our fourth quarter earnings call and webcast.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Gosnell, Vice President, Finance Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Ken Gosnell","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Campbell\u2019s fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018 earnings call. As usual, we have created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who will participate in a listen-only mode.","Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.","With that, I will turn the call over to Keith McLoughlin, Interim President and CEO. Keith?","Keith McLoughlin","Thanks, Ken and good morning everyone. Today, we will walk through our fourth quarter and full year results, cover the actions we are taking as a result of our comprehensive board-led strategy and portfolio review, and provide fiscal 2019 guidance and our updated long-term targets. Anthony will first handle the financial details of the quarter and the fiscal year, and then I will provide an in-depth review of the significant strategic actions we have planned.","Before I turn it over to Anthony, let me share some high level thoughts on what we announced on our press releases this morning. It was a tough end to a difficult year. At the 3 months in my role as Interim CEO and digging into the operations with the new management team, it\u2019s abundantly clear to me that the company is in need of greater focus and discipline. We have to run Campbell with a much tougher set of operating and financial standards. Despite our execution challenges, during the year we completed the acquisition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance, the largest transaction in the company\u2019s history which expands and strengthens our position in the growing snacks category. We also added Pacific Foods, a leader in organic soups and broths through our company. Both acquisitions bring valuable and growing brands that align with and complement our core capabilities and a more focused portfolio.","On top of these transactions, we continue to deliver against our multiyear cost saving programs. The results we delivered in fiscal 2018 along with our outlook for fiscal 2019 reinforce the rationale for why we undertook the strategy and portfolio review in the first place and the need for the significant actions we are taking to turn the company around. There are three critical action steps coming out of the review. First, Campbell must become a more focused company; second, to accelerate this focus, we need to divest certain non-core businesses and to use the proceeds to significantly pay down debt and strengthen our balance sheet; and third, we must further reduce cost and increase our asset efficiency to reflect a leaner, more focused, and agile enterprise we are building. These actions are designed to return the company to long-term organic sales and earnings growth.","I will cover all of this and more in greater detail shortly. I want to emphasize that the actions we announced today are the right moves at this time to create shareholder value. The board and management team are committed to de-leveraging the company, maintaining our investment grade credit rating, and rewarding our shareholders through dividends. The board also remains open and committed to evaluating all strategic options if they can demonstrably enhance value.","With that, let me turn the call over to Anthony to cover our financial results.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks Keith. Before getting into the details, I will make a few comments on our performance. Our results for the quarter were in line with our recent guidance despite having to overcome the impact of the voluntary recall of flavor blasted Goldfish which we announced in July. In the fourth quarter the recall had a negative impact of approximately $0.04 on adjusted EPS and is expected to have some continuing impact in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We are pleased with the performance of Snyder\u2019s-Lance, which exceeded our expectations and helped to offset the impact of the recall. As you will see, in this non-seasonal quarter, sales of U.S. soup declined by double digits. The decline reflects the continuing impact of our performance with our key customer, increased competitive activity, and reductions in promotional activity across the balance of the market. We are now in the process of implementing our pricing and promotional programs for the upcoming soup season, and as we wrap our issues from last year, we expect the trends in this business to improve.","We have continued our success in delivering against our cost savings target. In the quarter, we generated an incremental $30 million of savings on the base Campbell program bringing the year-to-date total to $95 million and the program to-date total to $420 million. Keith will talk about our plans to expand this program going forward. Lastly Keith will also share the results of our strategy and portfolio review and the actions we plan to take beginning in 2019. As we have stated before 2019 will be a transition year and I will review our guidance in detail. From that new 2019 base, we will be well positioned to deliver sustainable sales and earnings growth.","I will now review our detailed results. For the fourth quarter net sales on an as reported basis increased 33% to $2.219 billion. Excluding a 36-point benefit from the acquisitions of Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pacific Foods, organic net sales declined 3% reflecting declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and reflect about a one point negative impact attributable to the Goldfish recall. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was comparable to the prior year at $281 million. Excluding the impact of the Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pacific Foods acquisitions adjusted EBIT declined 16% also due to declines in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment. Adjusted EPS decreased 52% or $0.27 to $0.25 per share reflecting the EBIT decline ex-acquisitions, and the negative timing impact on the tax rate which we discussed last quarter. Overall, our EPS results were in line with our expectations.","For the full year as reported net sales increased 10% and organic net sales declined by 2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT declined 6% to $1.408 billion. Excluding the impact of the recent acquisitions adjusted EBIT decreased 10% and adjusted EPS of $2.87 was down 6%. Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter organic net sales declined 3% driven by lower volume and increased sales allowances and promotional spending. The recall of Goldfish crackers had a one point negative impact on organic sales in the quarter. Lower volumes were primarily the result of declines in our U.S. soup business. The increase in sales allowances negatively impacted total company sales by approximately one percentage point inclusive of costs associated with the voluntary recall of flavor blasted Goldfish crackers. Overall, promotional spending rate increased in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages driven by U.S. soup and in Global Biscuits and Snacks reflecting increased spending behind Arnott\u2019s biscuits in Australia. There was no impact on sales from currency translation this quarter. The recent additions of Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pacific Foods to the portfolio added 36 percentage points bringing our as reported sales increase to 33%.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased 5.6 points in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact from the acquisitions of Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pacific Foods, our adjusted gross margin percentage declined 2.6 points. While the acquisitions are reducing our overall margins as we add them to the portfolio, we are confident that the margins on these businesses will increase significantly over time as we integrate them into Campbell and achieve targeted cost and synergy savings. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 270 basis points, a majority of which was cost inflation, which on a rate basis increased approximately 4% reflecting higher prices on dairy, meat, steel cans and resins as well as the continuing escalation of transportation and logistics costs. The balance of the decline was driven by losses on open commodity contracts as compared to gains in the year ago quarter and the cost associated with the voluntary recall of flavor blasted Goldfish crackers. These negative drivers were partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiatives.","Portfolio mix had a negative impact of 70 basis points. The higher promotional spending in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks that I previously mentioned had a negative impact of 50 basis points. Pricing had a negative impact of 40 basis points reflecting higher customer returns and allowances due in part to the voluntary product recall. Lastly, our supply chain productivity program, which is incremental to our cost savings program, contributed 170 basis points of margin improvement. Overall, the recall on Goldfish had a 70 basis point negative impact on gross margin. All-in, our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased to 30.6%.","Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 28% in the quarter due primarily to the impact of recent acquisitions. Adjusted administrative expenses increased 22% to $151 million also due primarily to the impact of recent acquisitions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, adjusted administrative expenses were comparable to the prior year as consulting costs incurred in connection with the board led strategic review and increased benefit costs were offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items.","Adjusted EPS decreased $0.27 from $0.52 in the prior year quarter to $0.25 per share in the current quarter. Overall, adjusted EBIT had no impact on EPS as the addition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance was offset by lower EBIT on the balance of the business. Adjusted net interest expense increased by $64 million, a $0.13 negative impact to EPS driven by an increase in the debt level to fund our recent acquisitions and reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. Our adjusted EPS decline also reflects $0.13 from a higher adjusted effective tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter increased by about 22 percentage points to 59% as the timing of tax expense on an adjusted basis was negatively impacted by the impairment charges taken in the prior quarter. And lastly, benefiting from share repurchases in prior periods, a lower share count added a $0.01 benefit to EPS completing the bridge to $0.25 per share. Although not shown on the chart, the Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pacific Foods acquisitions in aggregate had a negative EPS impact of approximately $0.04. As I mentioned earlier, the performance of Snyder\u2019s-Lance exceeded our expectations in the quarter.","Now, turning to our segment results, in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales declined 6% driven primarily by declines in U.S. Soup and in Canada. Excluding the benefit of the acquisition of Pacific Foods, sales of U.S. Soup declined 14% reflecting declines in condensed, ready-to-serve and broth. The decline reflects the continuing impact of our performance with a key customer, increased competitive activity and reductions in promotional activity across the balance of the market. As I mentioned promotional programs for the upcoming soup season are currently being implemented, which we expect will improve our sales trends as we move through fiscal 2019. We are seeing improvement in our V8 Vegetable Juice business was delivered sales comparable to last year with consumption gains in V8 Original and V8 Energy. Segment operating earnings declined 21% in the quarter to $155 million. The decline was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage. Segment gross margin performance continued to be impacted by escalating cost inflation including transportation and logistics costs as well as from steel, meat and vegetables. I want to mention that in connection with our annual testing of intangible assets, we have recorded an impairment charge on the carrying value of the Plum trademark of $0.14 per share in our as reported EPS within corporate reflecting current performance which was below our expectations and a revised future outlook.","Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending July 29, 2018, the category continued to show growth increasing 40 basis points. However, our sales in measured channels including Pacific on a pro forma basis declined 3.5%. We had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, down 2.4 points from the year ago period. Our consumption and share decline are attributable to our performance with a key customer which we previously discussed. Private label grew share by 140 basis points primarily reflecting gains in broth finishing at 15.5%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 25.5% increasing one point.","In Global Biscuits and Snacks sales were $1.202 billion in the quarter including $565 million from the acquisition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance. Excluding the benefit of the acquisition, organic sales were comparable to prior year and reflected 2 point negative impact on segment sales from the voluntary product recall of flavor blasted Goldfish crackers. Segment operating earnings increased 42% to $158 million, primarily driven by the addition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance to the portfolio. Excluding the 45 point benefit from the acquisition, segment earnings declined slightly reflecting lower gross margin performance, partly offset by lower marketing and selling expenses and lower administrative expenses. Excluding the Goldfish recall, which had a 14 point negative impact operating earnings ex-acquisition increased double digits.","In the Campbell Fresh segment organic sales increased 1% to $228 million driven by gains in Garden Fresh Gourmet and carrot ingredients. This segment had an operating loss of $7 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $8 million in the prior year. On a companywide basis cash from operations increased slightly to $1.305 billion compared to $1.291 billion in 2017 as reductions in working capital were partly offset by lower cash earnings. Capital expenditures were $407 million, $69 million higher than the prior year reflecting investments to support our cost savings initiatives as well as the addition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pacific Foods to the portfolio.","We paid dividends totaling $426 million compared to $420 million in 2017. In aggregate, we repurchased $86 million of shares on a year-to-date basis, $75 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity based compensation. As previously announced, we suspended our share repurchases following the acquisition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance. Net debt of $9.7 billion is up from $3.2 billion a year ago reflecting the impact of the $6.1 billion acquisition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance and the $700 million acquisition of Pacific Foods, partly offset by positive cash flow from the base business. As we have stated we plan to use the proceeds from the divestitures to pay down debt and reduce our leverage ratios.","Now I will turn it back to Keith.","Keith McLoughlin","Thanks Anthony. On our third quarter earnings call, we announced that Campbell would be undertaking a comprehensive Board led strategy and portfolio review to develop a path forward for the company that maximizes shareholder value. This morning, we announced the initial set of significant actions to help us improve Campbell\u2019s performance and create economic value. Before discussing the details of the review in depth, let me first provide an overview of the process we undertook. The Board engaged outside advisors to conduct a thorough and objective review of the company and provide a fresh unbiased assessment of our strengths, weaknesses, strategy and execution.","One of the first steps we took was to examine the factors that led to our performance and execution challenge. It\u2019s important for me to articulate these so that our shareholders can hear how we plan to correct them and improve our results going forward. Simply put, we lost focus. We lost focus strategically. We had too many initiatives that made the company unnecessarily complex. We are in the food business and the ag business. We had growth businesses and we had cash businesses. We are focused on startup businesses and venture capital investing. We aggressively pursued the important consumer mega-trend of health and well-being without having clarity on our source of uniqueness or whether we brought a competitive advantage to the space and we depended too much on M&A to shape our business strategy.","We lost focus within our products and brands. We did not manage our portfolio in a differentiated manner. We pushed cash businesses for growth and we under-funded growth businesses. Our resource and capital allocation discipline was inadequate and we didn\u2019t properly align our resources with our core business franchises where we have strong market positions, unique capabilities and the right to win. Lastly, we lost focus in process and execution. Our management processes lacked the necessary operating discipline. We created too many silos throughout the company, where decision rights were unclear. We lacked agility and we are slow to react to customer needs. And finally, we didn\u2019t have a culture of accountability, which led to poor execution.","To round out this picture, we also faced industry-wide headwinds such as shifting consumer trends, our dynamic and changing retail environment and more recently significant cost inflation, all of which weighed on our performance. In addition to understanding these challenges, the review also highlighted several of Campbell\u2019s strengths, which we will build upon going forward. And these strengths are indeed enviable. We possess iconic brands with strong market positions. We have scale and market competencies within our core CPG categories, the majority of which are in growing segments. We have strong supply chain and manufacturing capabilities, where we have a heritage of making great tasting, real food that is both affordable and convenient. We know how to reduce costs and have consistently delivered our cost saving programs ahead of schedule. We have solid margins and cash flow generation. And Campbell has a deep keel. As a 150-year-old company, we have talent, capability and commitment that is both broad and deep. With greater focus, clarity and alignment, our people can and will execute on our new direction.","Going into the review, we recognized that meaningful changes were necessary. As I stated back in May, everything is on the table. We entered the review process with a completely open mind. And as we committed, the board together with our advisors considered a full slate of options, including optimizing our portfolio and divesting assets and businesses, splitting the company in two or selling the entire company. After considerable analysis and evaluation, the Board concluded that at this time the best path forward to maximize shareholder value is to optimize the portfolio and divest certain assets. We will focus our portfolio on two core distinct businesses within the North American market, Campbell Snacks and Campbell Meals and Beverages, where we would be able to leverage our iconic brands and leading market positions. To accelerate this focus, we are pursuing significant divestitures. In addition, we are increasing our cost savings by $150 million to reflect the leaner and more focused company that we need to become and we are liberating an additional $350 million in cash through working capital efficiencies and more disciplined capital expenditures.","Moving to the next slide, a major lever to drive our more focused portfolio is divesting non-core businesses. We are pursuing the sale of our Campbell international business, which includes Arnott\u2019s and the Kelsen Group and Campbell\u2019s fresh business, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and refrigerated soup business. These proposed divestitures represent approximately $2.1 billion in net sales in fiscal year 2018. We have engaged top tier financial advisors to run a disciplined process that will achieve maximum value. We intend to use the proceeds from these divestitures to significantly reduce debt and are targeting a pro forma EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.0x by fiscal year 2021. While these are great brands and solid businesses, they do not fit with our new strategic direction and we believe they will be of greater value to new owners who are focused on these categories and geographies. I want to stress that we will continue to identify additional actions to further optimize our portfolio going forward.","Turning to the next slide, the direction we have chosen will focus our portfolio on categories and geographies, where we have a right to win because of our demonstrated capabilities, scale and expertise. It will drive absolute clarity and alignment throughout the enterprise and it will improve our operational discipline by implementing a rigorous management model. While we are making significant changes, we remain committed to our purpose, real food that matters for life\u2019s moments. It is the reason why we do what we do. Consumers continue to seek out delicious and affordable foods that are responsibly crafted with real recognizable ingredients. People want to know what\u2019s in their food and how it\u2019s made.","A vision for Campbell is to be a leading focused snacks and simple meals company with a portfolio of best-in-class products and brands in our core North American market that generates sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our consumers. We based this strategy on the strengths I reviewed at the outset. One of the reasons that we chose to build our portfolio around Campbell Snacks and Campbell\u2019s Meals and Beverages is the distinct competitive advantages and leadership positions we enjoy in both of these businesses. We benefit from high brand equity with consumers, strong product attributes and enviable market positions. In fact, more than 95% of all U.S. households have a Campbell product in them.","Campbell remains deeply committed to our strong heritage of delivering great tasting, high-quality real food to consumers and leveraging consumer insights and trends, including health and well-being, snacking and convenience. Increased focus and discipline are key tenants of our renewed strategy and as such we will manage our portfolio of brands based on two differentiated operating strategies. The first strategy applies to brand franchises that will be managed to drive profitable growth. The second applies to brand franchises that will be managed to maximize margins and cash flow. Drive profitable growth, we will seek to grow these large and exciting brands faster than the categories in which they compete. This will apply to brands such as Cape Cod, Goldfish, Kettle, Lance, Late July, Pepperidge Farm, Milano and Farmhouse Cookies, Pace, Pacific, Prego and Snyder\u2019s of Hanover. Investments in innovation and consumer engagement will enable these brands to leverage evolving consumer trends, drive growth and fulfill their role in the Campbell portfolio.","In fiscal 2018, these brand franchises represented 44% of our net sales on a pro forma basis. Maximized margin and cash flow, we will seek to generate consistent profit and cash flow from these at-scale brand franchises, including Campbell Soup, Pepperidge Farm fresh bakery, SpaghettiOs and V8. Disciplined management focus and aligned investments will support their strong market positions to optimize operating margins and cash flow and to fulfill their equally important roles in Campbell\u2019s portfolio. In fiscal 2018, these brand franchises represented 56% of our net sales on a pro forma basis. By differentiating our approach, we will be better able to allocate capital and resources and truly differentiate how we manage our brands.","On the next few slides, we have outlined in further detail how we are going to manage our businesses going forward starting with Campbell Snacks. Our snacks business benefits from leading positions within large and attractive categories as you can see in this chart. Snacking is an industry and category that Campbell\u2019s knows well and we have a management team in place that has consistently delivered solid results within Pepperidge Farm. Within this business, we are of course spending an extraordinary amount of time and resources focused on the integration and value capture of Snyder\u2019s-Lance. Given our new direction, the economic and strategic importance of this work cannot be overemphasized. Our strategic review process has allowed the team another deep dive into Snyder\u2019s-Lance and we are even more convinced of the growth prospects and synergies in our Campbell Snacks business. Our team is applying the hard lessons we have learned from previous acquisitions. We have established a robust governance structure, rigorous targets and a disciplined system for tracking synergy goals. It\u2019s early, but based on what I am seeing I am confident in the results and the team\u2019s ability to deliver the synergies and drive growth.","Moving to Slide 24, I want to showcase how we are fueling expansion within the snacks business through our six power brands: Goldfish, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Snyder\u2019s, Kettle and Cape Cod chips in late July. These brands will drive approximately 70% of our growth. Our plan builds upon a proven model that we have successfully deployed within Pepperidge Farm focused on consumer insights, meaningful innovation and strong marketing to drive share gains. We are taking targeted action around each brand such as increasing manufacturing capacity and investing in innovation, marketing and e-commerce to drive growth. We will focus nearly 80% of our snacking marketing investment in these power brands to support our growth plans.","Switching to Campbell\u2019s Meals and Beverages on Slide 25, despite category headwinds and our recent challenges, we have some of the most storied brands, leading market share positions and strong margins. In the division, we are working to stabilize U.S. Soup of course as our top priority. Driving growth in sauces, including gaining share in Italian sauces and leveraging our new Snyder\u2019s-Lance insights and distribution capabilities to increase the presence of pace in the snack aisle. And strengthening our beverage business through continued focus on V8 Original, building on the success of V8+ Energy line and driving relevant innovations such as our recently launched V8+ Hydrate line.","I want to dive deeper into stabilizing our U.S. Soup business on Slide 26. First, we are thinking about this business differently than we have in the past. We will not place unrealistic expectations on it and we will manage the brands within the portfolio in a disciplined way. We expect improved trends in the latter half of fiscal 2019, but we do not expect U.S. Soup to grow this year. Given the importance of this business in the overall portfolio, I want to first give you the headline of what happened here and then go into more detail about the turnaround. Soup is a great business and Campbell\u2019s is an iconic brand. Business has been over relied upon to generate earnings and has been underinvested in. In recent years, we have pushed the business too hard on pricing and margin and we did not do enough to keep our soup products and brands relevant with consumers. In fiscal 2019, we will rebase soup and strengthen our value proposition in the marketplace. Recently, Roberto Leopardi was named President of our Meals and Beverages business, has put a new divisional leadership team in place. They are examining all aspects of the business, which requires a back to basics approach to begin to stabilize it in fiscal 2019. It starts with increased emphasis on price realization, optimizing merchandising support with key customers, reducing manufacturing cost and investments, more selective consumer driven innovation and more effective marketing focused on the Campbell\u2019s Master brand.","We will focus on four key brands: Campbell\u2019s, Swanson, Chunky and Pacific. Each will be managed according to a specific profile and portfolio role. We will manage Pacific to drive strong profitable growth, while our Campbell\u2019s, Swanson and Chunky brands will be managed to maximize margins and cash flow. Within each, we are taking targeted actions in line with these portfolio roles. To drive growth in Pacific, we are targeting higher income, older millennials, driving increased distribution in our core mass and grocery channels and applying our supply chain expertise to reduce manufacturing costs and we are leveraging Pacific\u2019s strong brand position in the natural channel to launch new innovative products. To maximize margins and cash flow, with Campbell\u2019s, Swanson and Chunky brands, we are increasing and optimizing marketing to drive purchase intent, focusing our messaging on convenient affordable delicious meal solutions, and utilizing price pack architecture to differentiate and sustain margins. Ultimately improving performance in U.S. Soup begins and ends with dramatically improved execution from our new leadership team and from a new base. I am confident that we are doing all the right things, but it\u2019s going to take some time to stabilize the business.","With a leaner more focused company, we see further opportunity to drive additional cost savings. As I mentioned at the outset, this is one of Campbell\u2019s demonstrated capabilities. In fact, we have delivered successful multiyear cost cutting targets ahead of schedule. We have identified an additional $150 million in cost savings. These savings will be driven by streamlining our organization, expanding our zero-based budgeting efforts and continuing to optimize our manufacturing network. This is in addition to the previously announced $500 million in cost savings and the $295 million in target synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance. Combined, these programs will bring our total cost savings target to just under $1 billion by fiscal 2022.","Additionally, we are driving asset efficiency and working capital and capital expenditures to generate an additional $350 million of free cash flow in the same timeframe. As you can see, we are taking significant actions to stabilize the company. While we have made specific choices to better focus Campbell, there is more to do both in terms of operationalizing these plans and streamlining their portfolio. We are working with urgency to improve our execution, speed and efficiency throughout the organization with the goal of driving margin expansion and free cash flow. Fiscal 2019 will be a transition year as we take these steps to restructure the portfolio, reduce leverage and emphasize better execution, all of which will establish the foundation for sustainable performance and profitable growth.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Anthony to outline our fiscal 2019 guidance and new long-term targets.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks, Keith. Now, I will review our 2019 outlook. Given uncertainty regarding the timing of divestitures, we are providing guidance based on our existing portfolio of businesses and also on a pro forma basis assuming divestitures were completed and proceeds deployed at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year, representing the new base from which we plan to grow.","I will start with the guidance pre-divestitures. We expect sales to increase to a range of $9.975 billion to $10.100 billion as we benefit from the incremental impact of both the Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pacific Foods acquisitions. This top line guidance implies that organic sales are expected to decline slightly. While we expect trends in U.S. Soup to improve as we implement our promotional programs, we anticipate that soup sales will decline in 2019. With our new leadership, we are in the process of developing a long-term strategy for the U.S. Soup business, which including focused innovation efforts, reinvigorating the Campbell brand and maximizing the opportunity with Pacific is expected to stabilize longer term performance. In addition, sales in Campbell Fresh will be negatively impacted by the expiration of two major private label refrigerated soup contract. We expect adjusted EBIT to be in the range of $1.370 billion to $1.410 billion as declines on our base business are mostly offset by the incremental acquisition impacts of Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pacific Foods.","The EBIT decline on the base business is primarily driven by three factors: the anticipated decline in organic sales, the negative impact of cost inflation on gross margin, and the negative impact from higher incentive compensation, which had been significantly reduced in 2018. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.53 per share. The delta between EBIT and EPS performance is primarily driven by the interest expense associated with the acquisition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pacific Foods. As mentioned, we are also providing forecast for 2019 on a pro forma basis assuming that planned divestitures are completed as of the beginning of the fiscal year and based on use of estimated sales proceeds to reduce debt.","As you can see on the chart, our sales base declined to about $8 billion, adjusted EBIT to a range of $1.230 billion to $1.270 billion and adjusted EPS to a range of $2.40 to $2.50. The overall dilution from divestitures is modest, given the current level of profitability of the Campbell Fresh division. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we do expect our first quarter performance to be negatively impacted by several factors. First we are adopting the new accounting rules for revenue recognition. Given the seasonality of our business, adoption will have a negative impact on Q1 of approximately $0.04 per share with no significant impact on the full year. Second, we expect the recall of flavor blasted Goldfish will have a negative impact on Q1. And lastly, we expect some continued pressure on U.S. soup as we implement our promotional programs and wrap the major customer issue in the first quarter.","Now I will provide some additional detail on the assumptions impacting our pre-divestiture guidance. As we have mentioned previously we are seeing significantly higher cost inflation which we estimate to be in the range of 4% to 5%. The key drivers are steel cans reflecting the impact of tariffs, transportation and logistics that continues to rise and on wheat, resins and corrugated. We continued to drive meaningful productivity savings in our supply chain which are incremental to our cost savings program. For 2019, we are targeting 3% of cost of products sold. We are targeting significant benefits from cost saving approximating $120 million from a combination of Snyder\u2019s-Lance cost and synergy savings and the ongoing Campbell program. Our recent decision to discontinue manufacturing in our Canadian plant and transfer most of the production to the U.S. will generate meaningful savings.","Overall, we expect our gross margin percentage will decline approximately two percentage points with about one point of the decline attributable to the negative mix impact of adding Snyder\u2019s-Lance to the portfolio or a full year compared to four months in 2018. The balance of the decline is primarily due to the impact of cost inflation in excess of productivity. With a full year of acquisition financing on the Snyder\u2019s-Lance\u2019s acquisition and the expectation of slightly higher interest rates, interest expense is forecast to be in the range of $375 million to $390 million in fiscal 2019.","With a full-year benefit of U.S. tax reform, the effective tax rate is expected to decline to a rate of about 25%. And lastly capital expenditures including spending on Snyder\u2019s-Lance and reflecting an overall decline as a percent of sales is expected to be approximating $400 million. We are revising our long-term targets for annual sales and earnings growth. Based on the actions we are taking in 2019 including plant divestitures, we are confident that from our 2019 post divestiture pro forma we have a solid base from which to grow. Nearly half of our portfolio will be positioned in the faster growing snacking categories and we will also benefit from incremental revenue opportunities from combining Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pepperidge Farm. Driven by growth in our snacking business and stable performance from soup and simple meals, we are targeting organic sales growth of 1% to 2%.","Our adjusted EBIT target is to grow 4% to 6% reflecting the benefits of the increased cost savings target Keith described and from achieving the Snyder\u2019s-Lance cost and synergy savings, both of which we are very confident we can deliver. As of the end of fiscal 2018 we have delivered $420 million of savings on the base Campbell program and $35 million on Snyder\u2019s-Lance for a combined total of $455 million. And as announced this morning our combined savings target is now $945 million by 2022. We are targeting EPS growth of 7% to 9% leveraging EBIT growth, using free cash flow to repay debt in the short-term and improved asset turnover as we aggressively manage our balance sheet by reducing CapEx as a percent of sales and generating positive cash flow from working capital reductions. The combination of improving margins driven by cost savings and improved asset utilization as measured by rapid turnover will meaningfully improve returns on invested capital generating economic value for shareholders. With the de-leveraging from divestitures and the continued use of free cash flow to reduce debt, leverage as measured by net debt to EBITDA is targeted to reach 3x by the end of fiscal 2021.","With that, I will turn it back over to Keith for some closing remarks.","Keith McLoughlin","Thanks, Anthony. Before we turn to Q&A, I want to provide an update on our leadership team starting with our CEO search. The Board is conducting a robust search process examining both internal and external candidates who possess the track record of proven results and achievement. The Board has been working with leading candidate assessment and executive search firms to assist in this process and we look forward to updating you when the Board is ready to name our new CEO. It\u2019s important to note that we have made several changes in our management team to improve performance, including meaningful changes within the Campbell leadership team over the last 6 months. In addition to the CEO change, we appointed Luca Mignini to the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer. We also have new Presidents in two of our three operating divisions who replaced a significant portion of the Meals and Beverages leadership team, including recruiting two senior executives from outside the company, Roberto as President and a new CMO, Diego Palmieri and we have a strong management team in place at Campbell Snacks under Carlos Abrams-Rivera with a combination of Pepperidge Farm and Snyder\u2019s-Lance leadership.","Today, Campbell\u2019s has a strong and importantly an aligned leadership team in place to drive the company forward and execute the plans we outlined today. In closing, we have a clear and executable strategic path forward to turnaround the business, improve operating discipline and return the company to sustainable profitable growth, all with the goal of returning capital to shareholders and maximizing long-term value. I want to be clear this is not the end of our work, but it is an essential beginning. It will be an ongoing dynamic process as we focus our portfolio, pay down debt, manage costs and increase our asset turnover while continuing to invest and drive innovation around our franchise businesses.","Now, let me turn back to Ken to call for your questions. Ken?","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Keith. Before we open it up for questions, a quick note, given the significant changes we will be implementing over the next several months, we have decided to reschedule our Investor Day from October to the spring. This will enable us to provide a more robust update on our progress at that time.","Okay. Shannon, let\u2019s open up the lines and take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","Hi, good morning everyone.","Keith McLoughlin","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","I have got just two questions. One, I guess that we have kind of fielded a lot this morning and over the last couple of weeks. Just could you maybe describe how you \u2013 the process you used to evaluate the value creation potential maybe between this strategic path, so asset sales and cost savings versus selling the whole company? Could you can give us a little bit more color in terms of how you thought about those two things and what the process was? And then I have got a follow-up.","Keith McLoughlin","Okay. Bryan it\u2019s Keith. Thanks for your question. I will start and maybe turn it over to Anthony. I can confirm, for sure, this was a robust process and as you would expect, we had world class and financial expert advisors. The Board was deeply engaged in the process and they examined all the potential strategic options to create value whether that\u2019s a sale, doing the plan that we talked today, splitting the company in parts, so a thorough review of all options. They determined that the path that we are announcing today is the best path forward at this time. We think the actions and we know the actions will improve our performance and then long-term economic and shareholder value. And as we\u2019ve stated, the Board remains open to evaluating all potential options that enhance shareholder value. In terms of the process itself relative to the different alternatives, Anthony, can you comment on that a bit?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Sure, Keith. Bryan, as Keith stated, we did add two expert financial advisors involved in the process and that process included several financial approaches. One, I would say is a detailed discounted cash flow analysis of each of the alternative strategies whether to optimize the portfolio, divest certain assets are split up the company. We also performed analysis of future share prices using a PE multiple approach and EBITDA multiple approach for each of the scenarios as well, and we also looked at historical transactions, multiples, and historical premiums. And as Keith said, based on that assessment, our conclusion based on that analysis is to focus on two businesses in one geography, as the right plan for us going forward.","Bryan Spillane","So fair to say that if there is a price for it in terms of the sale, that price just wasn\u2019t in the market today, right, so doing this is just better than sort of selling at the bottom here, is that just paraphrasing, but that\u2019s the way to kind of think about it?","Keith McLoughlin","Yes. I will say that we reviewed all options, and based on the information that we know, this is the best value maximizing path forward.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then just a follow-up. in terms of potential at some point, hiring a new CEO, is there a potential that a new CEO would come in and start a whole another strategic review process and just trying to understand how that affects kind of what you have decided to do here as we go forward and whether we should start to think about whether could be another sort of wave of change as you recruit CEO? Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Sure. Thanks for that question. I think the first thing I would say is this was not an individual led process, right. This was a Board led process, so the Board owns this. And the work we are doing here, and I have outlined today candidly has to be done, it\u2019s absolutely necessary, and I can\u2019t actually conceive of a scenario where it wouldn\u2019t need to be done. And the third thing I would say is we have got a strong operating team in place that\u2019s been obviously actively engaged in this process to execute it. So, I don\u2019t see a major change, of course that will be the prerogative, but I think again this is a Board -led strategy and with full and unanimous support from the Board.","Bryan Spillane","Alright. Thank you and have a great Labor Day.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning everybody.","Keith McLoughlin","Hi Andrew.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning.","Andrew Lazar","Hi, so I am sure there will be obviously plenty more questions on the strategic actions, so I would love to focus a little bit on the core business, you talked about organic soup sales down about 14% albeit in a small seasonal quarter. I think post the \u2013 obviously post the divestitures, soup and simple meals will be a higher percentage of the overall portfolio, so when thinking about your expectations for the core soup business in \u201919, I think you expected that you would expect that to be down still although improving through the year, I guess if you expect to, I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but if you expect to get back to a more normalized promotional cadence with a key customer this coming soup season, is it that volumes in soup will look better, but maybe the offset is kind of higher promotional spending if Campbell maybe need to help fund some of those promotions, and also I think I heard you talk about getting back to a more I think reasonable value proposition in soup, so I guess I am trying to a handle on the contributing factors around why soup sales would still be lower next year if you get back to a more normalized promotional cadence?","Keith McLoughlin","Let me try that and Anthony can jump in, Andrew, I think and you stated I think well, we have got to get back to basics on our soup business, and that means the entire array of benefits that we bring to the marketplace, right. So, we have got to get the price points right, we have got to get the merchandising support right, we have got to have the right level of brand investment, obviously product and packaging innovation is key items, and also reducing our total cost to serve, and so that\u2019s the word that Roberto and his team have underway. As you mentioned, ultimately it\u2019s a value proposition decision right with benefits, minus the price, and we need to \u2013 we made too many withdrawals. We have to make more deposits into the benefit side of that proposition. Anthony, do you have anything to add to that?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Sure. Andrew just a couple of points, one is on a pro forma basis, soup would be about 30% of our portfolio going forward, so it\u2019s up a little bit from where it was before. I think you are directionally correct on kind of what we are looking for in FY \u201819 which is better volume performance, but a little more trade spending on our part. And I would say with respect to the key customer couple of issues around timing is, one is we are lapping some pretty major hurricanes, we had a bit of a volume bump last year that we are wrapping and we are also not going to wrap the customer issue until we get to the middle of the first quarter. But with respect to that key customer we can\u2019t comment on the specifics, but what we can say is that we are aligned to the soup strategy for the upcoming soup season. That includes pricing, merchandising activity including the holiday programs as well as new items, so we expect to be back in business. And by the middle of September that programming and pricing will be in place, so we would expect trends to improve as we go into the heart of the soup season.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. Thanks. And then lastly with about $500 million of incremental cost savings coming over the next 4 years, obviously you have talked about under-investing in soup in the past and pushing a bit too hard on pricing and margins, I guess with that in mind can you give us a sense of maybe what proportion even broadly of let\u2019s say that $500 million would need to be invested back into the business because I am trying to assess the reasonableness if you will of the 4% to 6% EBIT growth target over time, that\u2019s a key component of that, I think in the past albeit a while ago you have talked about half of the cost savings needing to be invested back in the business I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s change dramatically or not?","Keith McLoughlin","Yes. We are not getting into each specific business, may be I can say that as you see in the portfolio set up here and specifically the roles within the portfolio, we are actually looking to deploy the vast majority of our resources against what we are calling these franchise brands, right. So brands that have strong position in the marketplace, that have best in class products that have strong market shares and have high margins. So what you are going to expect from us is we are going to only take money out of corporate treasury and deploy it against those winning brands and that\u2019s a significant shift. And it\u2019s going to allow credible discipline and focus for the organization because we win in those places.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ken Goldman","Hi, thank you. Two questions for me, first, you talked about the Board being open to all options including the sale, I understand why you might be emphasizing this, you have had some public pressures likely to be open to all options, but I guess I am curious is this statement any different anyway from what\u2019s always been the case, Boards are always required to be open to all options, it creates shareholder value, so I guess I am trying to really ascertain the willingness to sell, has that been heightened at all during the last few months or is the message today just hey, we have always been open and we are just kind of reminding you of that fact?","Keith McLoughlin","I would say a little bit to your point, we are a public company, alright. I mean we are for sale everyday, right, so a little bit to your point, nothing has changed there. I think what we are trying to emphasize is that we are committed and I committed to you I think back on May 18 that all options were on the table and no fake accounts because of what I said and that was the fact. And so as the Board went through the strategic alternative review process every material strategic alternative was reviewed and considered. So that\u2019s what we are emphasizing a bit. But to your point we are a public company.","Ken Goldman","Okay. Thank you for that. And then my second question is prior management obviously did some things that maybe you would do differently, but the Board also approved some of these acquisitions Kelsen, Plum, Garden Fresh, Bolthouse, all of these are now being sold or written down or both, so I guess what are the Board learnings from these deals and maybe should investors have any expectations that maybe the Board which didn\u2019t necessarily drive the company in the direction that you want to go Keith might change any further in terms of its composition to support some of these go forward strategies?","Keith McLoughlin","Right. That\u2019s fair. I think what I would say is my experience is that deal making works and really only works when acquired brands fit well into the buyer\u2019s capabilities and strength. And we have got some good examples of that right now. And in the case of Pacific, right and soup, in the case of Snyder\u2019s-Lance and connecting that strengths and capabilities of Pepperidge Farm snack and we have had some examples, but what is the case in carrots and potentially other areas. So I think that\u2019s the key learning, right and that\u2019s how we will leverage these most recent acquisitions and while we are getting good traction on that.","Ken Goldman","Okay. Thanks so much.","Keith McLoughlin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer","Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups on your organic trends, you said that you expect organic sales to decline in fiscal \u201819, but roughly how much are you baking in the guidance and you cited some improvements through the year and do you anticipate getting back to perhaps stability by the end of this fiscal year?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I will take that David. So I think when you guys unpack the guidance here, you will figure out there is a modest decline expected on organic sales. And the two primary drivers are one, the expected decline on U.S. soups. And second and I have mentioned this in my remarks is we have a couple of fairly significant expiring private label refrigerated soup contracts that are not going to get renewed and those contracts are probably worth about a point on total company sales. The soup decline is probably worth a point on total company soup on sales as well, so that gives you a sense for what our expectations are. And as I have said before our expectation is that trends on soup will improve as we get into the soup season.","David Palmer","And then just a follow-up on the long-term guidance, I am feeling there is a lot of investors that are simply not going to believe that Campbell is a long-term low single-digit top line grower and high single-digit EPS grower, you have scrubbed obviously a change in the complexion of the business, but you are also taking a hard look at it now and believe that past fiscal \u201819 that those are the right targets, is there any argument you can make that would help us \u2013 help convince us that this is going to be a balanced top line, bottom line growth company in fiscal \u201820 and beyond, I would love to hear any detail on that? Thanks.","Keith McLoughlin","Sure. Again, I could start and then Anthony can jump in, it probably goes back to the tough choices that we are making here right in having a much more focused portfolio where we are investing and driving and what we will call in franchise businesses, franchise branch where we already have strong brands, we already have strong margins, we already have best in class products, we already have strong market shares. It\u2019s actually having the discipline and the focus to invest in those winning franchises, so that\u2019s a very important part of this. So as that happens of course we are going to continue to grow. We are going to have growth. We are going to have expanding margins. We are going to increase our asset turnover. And as you know even with low single-digit growth and expanding margins based on what the margins we have and the work we are doing on our balance sheet is going to generate a lot of free cash flow in terms of strengthening the balance sheet and importantly give us the headroom to invest back in this business, on top of that maintaining healthy and steady dividend. So the algorithm, the value algorithm fits well and makes sense. We think it\u2019s anchored into the capital markets and is connected to the strategy. And we think that\u2019s to fulfill our role within our shareholders portfolio to deliver these long-term targets. Anthony you may want to speak some more on how \u2013 that leverage that we are getting between organic growth and EPS growth?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I mean, I would say when we get through this transition we will be a very different company. These planned divestitures will enable us to focus our portfolio on the two businesses and one geography, significantly reduce debt and delever the balance sheet. And as we take Campbell Fresh and Campbell International out, we are integrating Snyder\u2019s-Lance into the portfolio. This is a significant shift and the composition will be almost half of our sales will be in the faster growing snacking categories, we will benefit from revenue opportunities from the combination of Snyder\u2019s and Pepperidge. We have a significant cost reduction opportunity. We are targeting $945 million by 2022, $295 million of that from Snyder\u2019s-Lance. And as Keith said we have got a good track record of delivering against cost savings and we are very confident we can deliver against that $945 million. Keith also talked about managing the balance sheet, CapEx down as the percent of sales, reductions in working capital and that combination of top line growth although it\u2019s modest and cost driven margin expansion which we are confident we can achieve can generate 7% to 9% EPS growth.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good morning everybody.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning.","Keith McLoughlin","Good morning.","David Driscoll","I had a couple of follow-ups and then two more important questions, Keith this is pretty important for you, Keith as it related to CEO search are you one of the candidates?","Keith McLoughlin","I have not thrown my name in the hat. The Board as you know is conducting a robust search process and we have both internal and external candidates. They are utilizing leading candidate assessment and executive search firms as we talked about. I can tell you they own it in a big way. As for me, I am all in and I am all in for as long as the Board would like me be.","David Driscoll","Okay. And then on the savings program, if you guys get a lot going on here, just to make sure on the savings, you have got the big savings programs and then you have got like normal productivity, so you do not hit or mix these. First off, Anthony, is that correct? Every time you see these savings programs, these are kind of the episodic programs, but not just everyday productivity, is that correct?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Correct.","David Driscoll","Okay. Then, when we look at the $945 million column that you gave on one of the slides, I am really trying to understand savings that would be expected after fiscal \u201819 and I just want confirmation of the math, so it\u2019s $945 million, you did $455 million to-date and then you have got $120 million projected for fiscal \u201819 so I believe that would leave a sizable $370 million in projected savings after fiscal \u201819. Am I getting that right and that\u2019s not \u2013 there is no normal productivity in that?","Anthony DiSilvestro","That\u2019s exactly right.","David Driscoll","Alright, fine. Thank you for that clarification. On soup, just one follow-up on the question on soup, Anthony, you made this comment that you are going to have lapping issues or something first quarter still weak. In first quarter, soup was \u2013 it was really poor. The first quarter results last year were more negative than expected, because of soup. The declines were very substantial. Can you just explain more why you are making it sound that you face a tough comp in the year ago first quarter? It sure doesn\u2019t look like that when I look at those results in the year ago?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, I think you had to look at within the quarter and the timing of when the issue started with the key customer on the soup category and also some early benefits we had around the timing of the hurricane. And as we look at that and look at the pricing and promotional programs and new items that are going into play that\u2019s kind of how we see the season unfolding.","David Driscoll","Okay. Final thing for me is there is always inflation and I just don\u2019t hear that much from you guys as regards your attempt at gating pricing. Every other company is talking about this, where do you guys stand on your efforts to take pricing either, list pricing or price pack architecture, how significant is pricing in fiscal \u201819 and that\u2019s it for me? Thank you.","Keith McLoughlin","Yes, thank you. I will take that. We are taking pricing actions and we need to take more mature is kind of the short version. As you know, it\u2019s not an easy environment right now to get structural list price increases and therefore you have to play the whole keyboard. You got to do list price actions, you got to do gross to net work, you got to do mix, you got to do cost of engineering and our teams are doing all of that. My experience is that commodity cycles are like currency cycles. Ultimately, they have to make their way into the marketplace. Unfortunately, there is usually a lag right on both ways, but for us the question is not if they are going to make the way into the marketplace, it\u2019s when and how much and getting that pushed through. So we have more to do there, I would say stay tuned.","David Driscoll","And is it fair to say fiscal \u201819 is a little modest on this relative to the cost side and more will happen kind of maybe later in fiscal year really think about it in F \u201820 I think that\u2019s what you are trying to say?","Keith McLoughlin","What we are saying is we have to talk to our customers first and as soon as we talk to our customers, then we will communicate. You will be the second to know.","David Driscoll","Thank you so much.","Keith McLoughlin","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for the question.","Keith McLoughlin","Good morning.","Jason English","So Keith, lots of ground to cover, I just want to focus first and foremost on the fiscal \u201819 outlook. I know there is lots of moving pieces, but if I just spill down what I heard, I think there are really two core contributors to the earnings decline next year. One, the cost inflation, which is going to have strict productivity and second, the promo\/price\/value adjustments you are going to make on soup. Is that fair?","Keith McLoughlin","Yes, I would say, it\u2019s actually \u2013 Anthony you can jump in, but I think there is three buckets here. One is as you mentioned a biggest one by far is the cost inflation and for the previous caller\u2019s question we are not getting enough price to offset that in fiscal \u201819. So, that\u2019s the biggest headline or impact to our organic earnings in the year. As you mentioned also the sales decline both in the Meals and Beverages and also C-Fresh that Anthony mentioned, that there is a not insignificant part of the organic fresh soup business that is going away. And so the sales decline there is having an impact on earnings and we also have some administrative incentive comp numbers that are tough to comp over. Anthony can you comment any more on...","Anthony DiSilvestro","The incentive comp is not insignificant, it\u2019s not way down this year and it\u2019s about four point headwind to growth next year. On the marketing I would say that more of this is a shift within advertising consumer and trade as we focus on fewer brands, fewer initiatives and fewer campaigns and we are reallocating some of that money to the promotional line. So a lot of it is shifting around within the portfolio and not necessarily an absolute increase in total marketing as a percent of sales.","Jason English","And Keith in some of your opening remarks I guess your opening remarks in terms of strategic review process you expressed some frustration in terms lack of investment behind the core brands, behind sort of core related growth avenues, but as I listen to you walk us through the fiscal \u201819 guidance particularly in context of Anthony\u2019s last comment, you plan on cutting AMC trigger next year, reallocating fee for the next year, why could you not contemplate more reinvestment as you look to reset the base for next year and why shouldn\u2019t we think that particularly as we contemplate potentially a new CEO come into the fold one would be a wave of reinvestment need on the horizon?","Keith McLoughlin","So again it\u2019s a balancing act here a little. But you will see and it is happening in 2019 in some cases as we focus more within the portfolios or which portfolios we are going to focus on, but then within those portfolios. For example within U.S. soup, we are going to focus on the key brands that I have mentioned there. And actually there will be in some cases a 50% increase in brand spend, in advertising spend. So again it\u2019s probably a layer of detail as you can\u2019t see, but within the portfolio there is investments increasing not at insignificant rates against specific brands that we are targeting.","Jason English","Thank you. That makes sense. And one last housekeeping question, I will pass it on, in the quarter you mentioned the acquisitions were 300 basis points drag to gross margins, quick back to the envelope math so just the acquisitions will factor roughly a 25% gross margin to create a 300 basis points drag, is that roughly in the ballpark and if so you mentioned that Lance exceeded expectations, it doesn\u2019t sound like gross profit exceeded or maybe your expectations were that much slower, what exactly is exceeding expectations?","Keith McLoughlin","Yes. The math is right, the impact of the acquisition then is both Pacific Foods and Snyder\u2019s-Lance 300 basis point negative impact on order. If we dial back a few month as we came into the fourth quarter we had certain expectations for the performance in Snyder\u2019s-Lance. And I think as we mentioned there were a couple of things that we were dealing with one around not production equipment that was relocated and some higher than anticipated freight inflation. I think what exceeded our expectation is the fundamental performance of the business and the achievement of the $35 million of cost and synergy savings which helped to offset those other impacts. But net-net it\u2019s still up with a drag on the overall gross margin percentage and will be as we get the full year into next year about a point negative impact on next year relative to this year.","Jason English","Got it. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Keith McLoughlin","Good morning.","Chris Growe","Hi, Keith, you have talked about operating two different strategies for the business, one pursuing growth for biscuits and snacks and pursuing margin and cash flow for the rest of business and how many companies do this currently, I wonder if you could speak to the challenges of having those two separate strategies under one roof and to that end did the Board consider or would the Board still consider split these companies apart given the very different growth trajectories and capital requirements?","Keith McLoughlin","Yes. Let me start with your second question and that as we stated earlier the Board remains open to evaluating all potential opportunities to enhance value going forward, right. And right now what we are talking about today is what the Board has decided is the value maximizing strategy and if there is a better way to do it going forward, they maintain that flexibility. But right now it\u2019s focused straight ahead. And let me answer your question, so don\u2019t think about necessarily snacking is really tricky, so let me try to walk through it. We will think about it as two businesses with two completely different missions, right, snacking versus meals and beverages. It\u2019s actually the missions that we are talking about are brand missions. So, you have to go within snacking and within meals and beverages and so where are the businesses that have those criteria that we talked about right, so have the brand strength, have best-in-class products, have the market position, market share, have high margins. And then you say okay, I got a franchise business. Now, the next question is what\u2019s the market that they are planning it, right? Is it a growth market or is it a stable market in some cases like condensed soup is at the declining market. So there is still franchise businesses, but from that you say, okay, which ones already have the growth missions and which ones has an earning and cash machine. So that\u2019s how we are doing the work. And actually, it\u2019s honestly a more sophisticated way to operate and manage your portfolio we have done a ton of work over the last 10, 12 weeks with the senior leadership team to get through this. We have real good clarity on that and it\u2019s just hard work. It\u2019s not that complicated to manage it, it\u2019s just hard work and I think we are up for that.","Chris Growe","Okay, thank you for that. And then I certainly heard your comment about the divestitures and no doubt the Board has a full review of the assets that could be sold. I just want to see if I could understand the main determinant of the divestitures, particularly, Arnott\u2019s and Kelsen and C-Fresh is a separate item there certainly. But is the balance sheet the main concern sort of so getting cash in the door, getting debt down or was it more the lack of international scale that prompted the divestures?","Keith McLoughlin","Yes.","Chris Growe","Okay, thank you. So just one quick one then and maybe for Anthony or for you, Keith, but just the long-term EPS growth rate which you have discussed it\u2019s gone up and I just want to make I understood what\u2019s behind that, is that just the use of cash and paying out debt and buying back stock or I think about this as a long-term, what is it that you see that\u2019s driven that EPS growth rate higher?","Keith McLoughlin","Anthony?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, I think like I said I think we fundamentally have a different business coming out of this transition than we do today. One that has a higher exposure to the faster growing snacking categories, one that has tremendous cost saving opportunities on the heels of the acquisition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance and the opportunities that we have to integrate Snyder\u2019s and Pepperidge and Campbell together. It\u2019s also driven by the successful cost take-out that we have had ongoing at Campbell than the fact that now we are now going to increase that by $150 million and we have good line of sight in terms of where that\u2019s going to come from. You get some lift obviously between EBIT and EPS, because we are as we drive the earnings growth and manage the balance sheet that the cash flow generation is going to be even more significant using that cash flow to repay debt in the short-term and then transition to other uses of cash as we get the leverage ratio back to where we wanted to be.","Keith McLoughlin","Just build on that a little bit, one of the opportunities that we see in the company as Anthony mentioned is to work the balance sheet as hard as we work the income statement. I think historically we haven\u2019t done that in the company and go back a few years, we probably didn\u2019t necessarily have to do that, but we have to do that now and we should be doing it, right. So as some of you know, my experiences is not limiting businesses with margins like we have here, right, which meant you work that balance sheet everyday. And so we are going to employ that and we have already activated several initiatives against that and that will help when you get those assets starting faster and get those margins expand into free cash with the kind of margins, we have, the free cash flow generation here is potentially significant.","Chris Growe","Okay. Well, thank you for all that discussion there. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","Hi. A couple of questions. One is I think you might have a response from the activist investor who is involved in your name and may even try to get board seats, what is your willingness to accept new additions to the board from this party? Second, I am still a little unclear on why Snyder\u2019s-Lance was better than expectations. By my math, operating margin for the business was maybe mid to high operating margin and Keith as you have dug deeper into this business, why is the margin so low and what makes you comfortable it can go higher from here?","Keith McLoughlin","Yes, let me start with your first question, which really unfortunately I won\u2019t comment on, we are not \u2013 it\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment on speculation on what might and might not happen with regards to what shareholders would do or won\u2019t do. So rather not speculate. And then specifically on your second question relative to make sure I got it, if you could restate it a little bit around the margins in Snyder\u2019s-Lance, was that the question?","Robert Moskow","Yes. And Anthony can chime in, but what\u2019s the operating margin for that Snyder\u2019s-Lance contribution, it seems mid to high single-digit and I think you said that you dug deeper into it, you are very happy with the fundamental performance, I think there was even some comments last quarter about price contracts that were unfavorable, I haven\u2019t heard anything any update on that either, so am I doing the math right and why should the margin go higher?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I will give you the number that the margin in its stub period here was about 9% on $770 million odd worth of sales. And as I have said before there has been plusses and minuses. We have had to deal with the trade issue on one of the categories which we mentioned previously we are dealing with this is not production challenged and a bit higher inflation particularly around freight. So we have been able to offset more than we had expected coming into the quarter and that\u2019s been driven by a factor realization of cost savings than we initially anticipated. As we have said we are at $35 million as we finish the year, so that\u2019s the piece that exceeded our expectations and in fact it helped to offset a majority of the other issues that I mentioned.","Robert Moskow","Anthony do you think the margins overall for snacks could go back to 15% for the combined division or once you get all the synergies you expected?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Absolutely, as we look at this business and we had the opportunity as we did the strategy review to take another deep dive into Snyder\u2019s-Lance or even more optimistic and confident that we can achieve these forecasts. And if I just talk about 2021 we had previously talked about an EPS accretion range of $0.40 to $0.55. I would say now that I would be at the higher end of that range in terms of our outlook as we sit here today.","Robert Moskow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John Baumgartner","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Keith just wanted to stick with the plans to improve soup, in that we have seen Campbell keep its level of total integrated marketing spend relatively unchanged over the past decade even as other simple meals categories had become more competitive, so what has the review told you about the extent to which this turnaround in soup has to be geared towards having the better compete against other categories outside of soup versus how much has begun within soup versus private label and other brands?","Keith McLoughlin","Right. So let me make sure I address your entire questionnaire. So let me start with soup, what we have looked at and what we have realized the course is as I mentioned we probably pushed that business too hard, right. And didn\u2019t \u2013 in some cases it didn\u2019t have the price points right and that\u2019s just all price points were relative to other things, right. So our price points relative to private label, relative to ready to serve, relative to competitive products. So we have got to get that right. We got to make sure we have the right and cadence of merchandising support. We didn\u2019t necessarily have that. Candidly, we have pulled back over the last several years a lot of brand support and you can\u2019t do that in this business, right. So we have got to come back to that. And also I think the innovation we have actually spent a fair amount of money on innovation. We just haven\u2019t had success rates, right. So we have got to be tighter and more effective and more efficient and more focused on these brands that we are talking about with our innovation. So, there is lots of work to do and the team \u2013 we are all over it, we are engaged in the marketplace, with our customers, obviously connected to consumer, so we have got some cool things that we are working on. You won\u2019t see that in the beginning of the first half of \u201819, but as we get through \u201819 and into honestly the FY \u201820 soup season I am quite optimistic. In terms of the other businesses, simple meal businesses, as you know there are some good healthy businesses there, right. So we want to that have good margins and some good growth. So we want to support those as well. They have specific missions, some are different than others of course what you are talking about SpaghettiOs or V8 or Prego so depending on where they are and where they sit in the marketplace, we are \u2013 they have differential missions and therefore differential deployment of resources. Does that answer your question?","John Baumgartner","Yes, very helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe a follow-up for Anthony, just wanted to come back to the increased savings target for core Campbell, can you walk through just maybe more detailed buckets and sources for that, I mean how much is in COGS versus SG&A. And then specifically any comments you have on the manufacturing side, because I guess we have seen Campbell already closed its highest cost, least efficient plants over the year, so what\u2019s any new on that front?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Sure. So as we talked about the total now is to target $945 million and that\u2019s a combination of the base Campbell program which we had been targeting $500 million. We finished the year at $420 million and in side of that and one other thing that\u2019s going to generate some of the incremental savings on that program is the recent decision to discontinue manufacturing in our Canadian plant and transfer most of that production to the U.S. So we are still making decisions around the plant network and the footprint. And the other piece of it as I have said before is the Snyder\u2019s-Lance that\u2019s $295 million. And then lastly as Keith said there is an incremental $150 million. I don\u2019t have exactly the split between G&A and COGS, but I consider they are going to be both in there, where there are some organizational costs that we are targeting. There are some further ZBB work that we can do would come a long way since 2016 on the ZBB process and having implemented it here and have some experience with that, so we are going to expand that a little bit. And then we think there is additional opportunities in supply chain, some of those are procurement related, some of them are manufacturing related. So we continued to look at our footprint growth, the plant network and the production line within those plants. You may recall one of the things we have done over the last couple of years is our \u2013 we call our soup common platform initiative. It gives us a lot of flexibility, more common can sizes with the flexibility on the size up and down. So that has enabled us to take production lines out within plant and we will continue to look at the overall plant network, obviously including the Snyder\u2019s-Lance plant.","John Baumgartner","Great. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is open.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good morning.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning.","Steve Strycula","So Anthony, a few questions for you, just wanted to walk through a clarification, the one percentage point drag you are getting from the fresh soup business, is that coming primarily or being recorded in the C-Fresh segment and if so what that\u2019s embedded in for the fiscal \u201819 numbers, does that imply sales are probably down $100 million for that segment and is profit segment about equal to what was in 2018 or is it a little bit worst?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. The soup contracts that I talked about our refrigerated soup contracts and they are within the Campbell price division that probably represent about a point on total company sales and we are going to lose, it\u2019s not the greatest margin, but we will lose some margin on that. What we\u2019re anticipating overall on Campbell Fresh is to make improvements in the Bolthouse Farms business which is a combination of carrots and refrigerated beverages and salads. We are expecting some improvement there will give some back on the other side, probably call it a push overall.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Keith McLoughlin for closing remarks.","Keith McLoughlin","Okay. Thank you and thanks everyone for joining the call today. Although it\u2019s always been 90 days, a lot has been accomplished and a lot has been decided. Having said that, this is an important beginning, we have several important work streams underway that we are very excited about and we look forward to updating you on our progress in those work streams, several of which those on the phone have asked about today, so we are looking forward to updating you. Of course we also have to operationalize these points, so we got a lot to work to do going forward, but we are quite confident there. One thought I would like to leave you with is this is a new Campbell, a Campbell that is focused on our franchise businesses to drive sustainable profitable growth, that is stronger both in our balance sheet and our management team, that is leaner and more agile with less bureaucracy and faster decision making and that is disciplined and our capital allocation, our resource deployment and our drive to maximize shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning. And for those of you in the U.S., wish you a great Labor Day weekend. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I'd now like to introduce to your host for today's conference, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead."," ","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Kate and good morning everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014 earnings call and webcast for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, our Chief Financial Officer; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations."," ","I am going to start things of with a few reminders including items impacting comparability and our quarterly earnings days for fiscal 2015. Denise will follow me with her perspective on the quarter of the year and our plan through fiscal 2015. Anthony will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year, finishing with our expectations for fiscal 2015 and after that we will take your questions."," ","As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com and on our IR app which is available through Google or Apple. Please keep in mind that our call is open to members of the media who are participating in listen-only mode."," ","Today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements, which reflects Campbell\u2019s current expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks."," ","Please refer to slide three in the presentation or to Campbell\u2019s most recent 10-K and SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning\u2019s news release, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded $21 million of pre-tax restructuring charges and restructuring related costs to improve our supply chain efficiency in Australia, to reduce overhead across the organization and for previously announced initiatives.","We also recorded an additional 4 million pre-tax settlement charge associated with the US pension plan. Last year in the fourth quarter we recorded $30 million of pre-tax restructuring charges and restructuring related costs to improve our US supply chain and structure, to expand assets to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico, to improve the Pepperidge Farm supply chain and reduce overhead in North America. ","Our comparisons in fiscal 2014 with fiscal 2013 to exclude previously announced items as shown on slide four. So now let me remind you that we will use non-GAAP measures to enhance our explanations. We\u2019ve provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as appendix to the slides to accompany our presentation.","Because the guidance for fiscal 2015 is on a 52 week versus 52 weeks, we show the estimated impact of the extra week in fiscal 2014 on sales and earnings as well. These slides along with our earnings release and selected quarterly and annual financials also can be found on our website which is available online or on your mobile device with the Campbell IR app. ","Last, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2015 earnings dates shown on slide six. Like this quarter, the days are a little later than usual due to the 53rd week which you will be hearing a lot on this call. ","November 25 is when we plan to report first quarter, the next three earnings dates are February 25 of 2015, May 22 of 2015, and September 4, of 2015. With that let me turn the call over to Denise. ","Denise Morrison","Thank you Jennifer and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. At our investor day in July, I told you that I remain confident that our strategy to reshape Campbell by strengthening our core business and expanding in to faster growing spaces is the right course for our company, and I also know that it will take more time than we originally anticipated to achieve our long-term growth targets.","Our industry is now in a period of profound change and challenge, and there has been a meaningful decline in the performance of the packaged food sector. Sources like the economic environment, the transformation of consumers\u2019 food preferences with regard to health and wellness and their demand for greater transparency, the powerful social and demographic changes and the rise of e-commerce are all driving significant changes in consumer behavior with respect to food. ","With this as background, today I will focus most of my remarks on our performance for full year 2014 and our expectations for fiscal 2015. But first, I will briefly comment on our fourth quarter results. ","Our fourth quarter results benefited from the extra week in the fiscal year, which was a significant driver in the quarter, as we delivered 7% sales growth and double digit growth in adjusted EBIT and EPS. ","Organic sales in the quarter decreased 2%, as our core business continued to under perform in a challenging consumer environment. Turning to our full year results, in 2014 including the 53 week and the benefit of acquisitions, Campbell delivered growth in both sales and adjusted earnings. ","We were encouraged by the performance of the businesses we acquired in the last two fiscal years, as part of our strategy to reshape Campbell\u2019s growth trajectory, but we were not satisfied with the performance of our core business and our organic sales results for the year reflected the extremely difficult market conditions which were impacting the food business.","Consistent with our most recent guidance, sales from continuing operations increased 3% to nearly $8.3 billion, benefiting from acquisitions and an extra week in the fiscal year. Organic sales declined 1%.","Adjusted earnings before interests and taxes from continuing operations grew 4% to nearly $1.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations 2% to $2.53.","In US Simple Meals, we delivered growth in sauces with higher sales of Prego pasta sauces and Campbell\u2019s dinner sauces. But after growing 5% in fiscal 2013, sales declined in US soup, as organic growth in Swanson broth which increased 8% was more than offset by declines in ready-to-serve and condense soups amid softer consumption.","In Global Baking and Snacking, the acquisition of Kelsen Group contributed a $193 million in sales. We had modest growth in Pepperidge Farm, including continued gains in our Goldfish franchise and fresh bakery. We had solid growth in Indonesia. As we expected, sales declined in our business in Australia. ","As we outlined at our investor day in July, we have initiated turnaround plans to reinvigorate both our Australian business and your US beverages business which also declined for the year.","Overall we are embracing change and continuing to diversify our portfolio. We are building a presence in packaged fresh and other faster growing spaces in strategically important geographies outside of our developed markets and in channels that will make our products available everywhere consumer shops.","In fiscal 2014, we achieved some key milestones in the execution of these strategies. We completed our acquisition of Kelsen Group, which is given us a valuable growth platform with 40% of its sales of baked snacks in China and Hong Kong.","We invested in our first marketing programs to build the Bolthouse Farms brand and expanded the distribution of Bolthouse products driving solid sales growth and share gains of super-premium beverages in measured channels.","Internationally, we divested our slow-growing European simple meals business to focus on growth opportunities in Asia and Latin America, and expanded our sweet biscuit business in Indonesia, a key developing market.","In January, we transitioned to a new US network of distributors for our single-serve beverages. Overtime we expect this network to drive immediate consumption growth for both our V8 and Bolthouse Farms brands.","We increased our digital and e-commerce capabilities to enhance our connection with consumers, who are engaging with brands in new ways. We continue to drive consumer focused innovation with new products equaling 11% of lists sales on a rolling three basis.","Across our portfolio, we reduced overhead costs, which is critical to funding our growth. Finally, we reflected on our company\u2019s purpose which we have expressed in seven words, real food that matters for life\u2019s moments. This will be the compass that guards our decision as we aspire to become a $10 billion company within the next five years.","It affirms our connections to the core values that have inspired trust in Campbell in the past and it bridges us to the priorities of new generations.","Now that 2014 is behind us, I want to give you a brief overview of our plans for fiscal 2015. We\u2019ll take further actions to drive growth in our important US soup portfolio, and improve category performance. To do this, we will continue to elevate quality, increase our brand building, and drive more innovation, including our first Campbell\u2019s organic soups.","We intend to expand in the Premium Soup segment, strengthen ready-to-serve soups, and grow our number one position in condense soups and broths. We will drive growth in Pepperidge Farm by executing against all the drivers of demand, including increased innovation, particularly in the back half of the year.","We will revitalize our shelf-stable US beverage business by leveraging innovation and the powerful equities of the V8 brand in vegetable nutrition to capitalize on the juicing trend with affordable juicing.","We will continue to stabilize our Australian business and rejuvenate sales of Arnott\u2019s biscuits in that key market. In faster growing spaces, our acquisitions of Bolthouse Farms, Plum and Kelsen have diversified our nearly $8.3 billion portfolio as we continue to our shift centre of gravity. We expect all three of these businesses to grow the top line, as we expand distribution.","To continue to drive our expansion into faster growing spaces, we will focus on four key platforms under our long-term strategy. Number one, accelerating break-through innovation, including continued expansion in Campbell\u2019s dinner sauces and plans this year to extend the V8 brand to adult on-the-go nutrition protein bars and shakes. Across our portfolio, will on more than 200 new products, as we continue to respond to the evolving tastes and needs of consumers.","Number two, becoming a leader in packaged fresh foods, a growing $18.6 billion category in which Bolthouse Farms has given us a solid foundation, and is now expanding with the launch of Bolthouse Farms Kids, an innovation portfolio of healthy snacks and beverages for children.","Number three, expanding and developing markets in Asia and Latin America, building on our footholds in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mexico; and finally, increasing the availability of all of our products in all channels, including immediate consumption channels and e-commerce.","We will fund our growth by aggressively managing our cost and margin. Furthermore, will become a high-performance company as we continue to drive agile decision-making, own our results and to track and retain world-class talent to further diversified our team.","In fiscal 2015, we expect to deliver growth of 1% to 2% of sales, and between 0% to 2%. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS from continuing operations on a 52-week basis. This guidance reflects the impact of some significant headwinds that will affect year-over-year comparisons.","Importantly, while we will continue to invest in our platforms for long-term growth, we are prepared to take additional actions if these headwinds accelerate. It is important to note that our growth in fiscal 2015 won\u2019t be evenly distributed across quarters. ","Our first quarter comparison will be favorable, because in fiscal 2014 we experienced retailer inventory movements and later Thanksgiving holiday timing that pushed sales in the second quarter.","We expect a larger amount of holiday sales this year to shift back to the first quarter, and as a result, looking at our business performance on a first half basis versus a quarterly basis will be more meaningful.","We continue to believe that our long-term growth targets 3% to 4% in organic sales, 4% to 6% in EBIT, and 5% to 7% in EPS are achievable. However, we recognize as we said at our investor day that further portfolio reconfiguration, including smart external development may be required to deliver and sustain growth at this level.","We have meaningfully change the composition of our portfolio and are following through our commitment to diversify our business in to faster growing spaces. But we know it will take some time to realize with full promise of our new platforms, and we know that we stand at a critical juncture.","In closing, I believe it is essential to balance optimism with realism. Consumers are changing in profound ways. At Campbell we\u2019re putting the consumer first and adapting quickly to the new normal of our world. While remaining true to our core beliefs, we have opened our minds to new ways of thinking about our business.","To win in the long-term, food companies will have to embrace change and lead change, and we\u2019re doing this at Campbell. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes, and I will now turn the call over to Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning and thanks Denise. I will walk through our fourth quarter results and segment highlights, followed by look a at our fiscal year results. As Jennifer indicated, both our fourth quarter and fiscal year results included extra week compared to the prior year.","We\u2019ll wrap up with a look at our fiscal 2015 guidance, which will be presented on a 52 to 52-week basis. As usual, my discussion of results will exclude items impacting comparability which are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliations.","For the fourth quarter, we reported net sales from continuing operations of 1.852 billion, an increase of 7% versus the year ago quarter. These sales results include a seven-point benefit from the 53rd week and a three-point contribution from our Kelsen and Plum acquisitions.","Excluding the 53rd week acquisitions and a negative impact of currency, organic net sales decreased by 2%, driven by declines in our US Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking segment, probably offset by gains in Bolthouse and Foodservice.","Adjusted EBIT increase 25% to 259 million, the increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week probably offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.49, a 14% increase versus the prior year, reflecting an EBIT growth probably offset by a higher effective tax rate.","The next slide shows a composition of our sales performance. As you can see, there was no impact from volume mix and rising. The organic sales decrease of two points reflects increased promotional spending, primarily related to higher rates of spending to remain competitive in our Global Baking and Snacking segment.","Unfavorable currency had a one-point impact due to the Australian and Canadian dollars weakening against the US dollar. The acquisition of Kelsen and seven additional weeks of Plum added three points. The benefit of the 53rd week added seven points to sales growth.","Our adjusted growth margin percentage declined by 240 basis points to 34.3%. Of the decline, 210 basis points came from the base business and 30 basis points was the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the decline in gross margin was primarily due to increased supply chain costs, cost inflation and higher promotional spending probably offset by productivity improvement.","To give this some context, the fourth quarter is a relatively small quarter for us and the increase in supply chain costs negatively impacted gross margins by about two points. This included the impact of fixed cost absorption compared to last year and mark-to-market losses on open commodity contracts.","Importantly, going forward, we estimate that our gross margin percentage for the full-year of 2015 will be comparable to this year. Marketing and selling expenses for the quarter decreased by $2 million to 189 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, lower selling expenses, and the impact of currency probably offset by the impact of acquisitions.","[A&C] for the quarter and the year fell 2%, while total marketing support, including trade spending rose for both period. Administrative expenses decreased 46 million to 149 million, primarily due to lower incentive composition costs and cost savings from recent restructuring initiatives.","Not let\u2019s look at below the line items; for the quarter net interest expense of 30 million was comparable to the prior year quarter as a lower debt balance and lower interest rates were offset by the impact of the additional week. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 33.2%, an increase of 8.5 points versus the prior year.","The 2013 rate was significantly lower, benefiting from lower taxes and [forward] earnings. Reflecting the impact of the higher tax rate, both adjusted earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 14%.","Fourth quarter segment sales results and the organic growth rates are shown on the next slide. The Global Baking and Snacking segment, our largest segment by sales in the quarter delivered 628 million in sales, including a 32 million contribution from Kelsen.","Organic sales declined 2% versus the prior year, we declines at Pepperidge Farm and Arnott\u2019s. The sales decline at Pepperidge Farm was driven by increased promotional spending probably offset by volume gains. Sales of cookies and crackers were comparable to prior year gains in Goldfish snack crackers offset by declines in Pepperidge Farm adult cracker varieties.","Sales of frozen and other products declined, while sales of fresh bakery products increased, driven by volume gains in breads and rolls. The sales decrease at Arnott\u2019s was due to weakness in Australia primarily in savory and sweet varieties probably offset by continued strong sales growth in Indonesia.","Our US Simple Meals segment delivered 518 million in sales, including 32 million of sales from Plum. Organic sales decreased 5% versus the prior year, within this segment; US soup organic sales decreased 10%, including seven point declines due to movement in retailer inventories.","As you may recall, we ended the third quarter with inventory levels higher than the prior year due to the later timing of the Easter holiday. As we ended fiscal 2014, retailer inventory levels were comparable to year ago. Our consumer takeaway of soup and measured channels was down 3% in the quarter.","Organic sales of other simple meals increased by 2%, driven by gains in Campbell\u2019s dinner sauces and Prego pasta sauces. Our Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segment posted 334 million in sales. It was the best performing segment as organic sales increased 4%.","Double-digit growth in Bolthouse Farms premium, refrigerated beverages and salad dressings was probably offset by decreases in North America foodservice. International simple meals and beverages delivered 188 million in sales. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year, as declines in Latin America and Asia Pacific regions were probably offset by gains in Canada.","US beverages delivered sales of 184 million, organic sales decreased 1% due to declines in V8 V-Fusion, Crowley offset by gains in V8 Splash beverages, and V8 vegetable juice. Excluding the sales decline associated with the continuing transition to our new immediate consumption [round] to market, organic sales would have been up modestly in the quarter.","Operating earning\u2019s for US simple meals increased 4% to 114 million. The improvement was primarily due to the 53rd week, and lower administrative and marketing expenses, probably offset by the decline in US soup sales and a lower gross margin percentage.","Operating earnings for global baking and snacking increased 17% to 98 million primarily driven by lower administrative expenses in the extra week probably offset by a lower gross margin percentage. The increase reflected earnings growth in Pepperidge Farm and the addition of Kelsen Group\u2019s operating results. Earnings for Arnott\u2019s were comparable to the prior year quarter.","Operating earnings for US beverages more than doubled to 43 million. The gain was primarily driven by lower administrative, selling and marketing expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week. Operating earnings within [Bolthouse] and Kelsen foodservice gained 16% to 29 million. ","The increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week probably offset by a lower gross margin percentage and higher marketing expenses, as we continue to support the Bolthouse Farms brand.","In International simple meals and beverages, operating earnings totaled 21 million, an increase of 50%, primarily due to a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement and the benefit of the 53rd week.","Our full-year results as shown on this chart were consistent with our most recent guidance for sales, EBIT, and EPS. For the year, net sales were up 3%, while organic net sales decreased 1%. Declines in US beverages and International simple meals and beverages were probably offset by gains in the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment. ","Adjusted EBIT increased 4% on lower administrative expenses, a three point benefit from the 53rd week, and lower marketing expenses, probably offset by a lower gross margin percentage and the organic sales decline. Adjusted earnings per share increased 2% to $2.53, including a $0.08 benefit from the 53rd week.","For this fiscal year, sales grew 3% driven by a three-point contribution from acquisitions, and the two point benefit from the 53rd week minus one point each from lower organic sales and unfavorable currency translation.","Organic sales decreased 1% as the impact of high promotional spending was probably offset by higher selling prices. Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 190 basis points to 35.4%. ","The decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to cost inflation, higher promotional spend, increased supply chain cost, and unfavorable impact of acquisitions, probably offset by productivity improvement and higher selling prices.","The rate increase in cost of goods sold was approximately 4% for the year in line with our estimates, probably offset by productivity savings of 3%. Marketing and selling expenses decreased 1% for 12 million, the change was primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, the impact of currency, lower marketing overhead expenses and lower selling expenses probably offset by the impact of acquisitions.","Administrative expenses decreased 15% or 104 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, cost savings from restructuring initiatives and lower pension cost, probably offset by the impact of acquisitions.","For this fiscal year, net interest expense decreased 5% or 6 million primarily due to lower average interest rates on our debt portfolio. That adjusted tax rate for this fiscal year was 31.7%, a 1.9 point increase versus the prior year, which benefited from lower taxes on foreign earnings and a favorable settlement of certain US state tax matters. Adjusted earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 2%.","I\u2019ll briefly comment on full-year segment results. In the US Simple Meals segment organic sales were comparable to a strong prior year, which saw sales grow 5%. Within this segment, US soup organic sales decreased 2%, while sales of other simple meals increased by 4%, primarily due to growth in Prego pasta sauces and Campbell\u2019s dinner sauces.","Our Global Baking and Snacking segment includes a 193 million contribution from Kelsen. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year, as sales growth in Indonesia and Pepperidge Farm driven by Goldfish were offset by declines in Arnott\u2019s in Australia.","Our Bolthouse and Foodservice segment had organic sales growth of 2%, with double-digit gains in Bolthouse Farms, premium, refrigerated beverages, and salad dressings, probably offset by declines in North America food service.","Organic sales for International simple meals and beverages decreased by 3%, with declines in Latin America, Canada and the Asia-Pacific region. US beverage organic sales decreased 4% due to sales declines in our V8 V-Fusion multi-served beverages, as well as weakness in our single-serve products, as we continue the transition to our new distribution networks for the immediate consumption channel.","Commenting on full-year segment earnings, US simple meals operating earnings decreased 2% to 714 million as a lower gross margin percentage and expenses related to the number 2013, Plum recall were probably offset by lower administrative expenses, low marketing expenses and a benefit of the extra week.","Global baking and snacking earnings gained 5% to 332 million. The increase was primarily driven by lower administrative expenses, the acquisition of Kelsen, low marketing expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week probably offset by a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable impact of currency.","The increase reflected growth in Pepperidge Farm and Kelsen Group\u2019s operating results, probably offset by lower earnings in Arnott\u2019s. US beverages operating earnings increased 6% to 127 million, primarily driven by lower administrative and marketing expenses, probably offset by a lower gross margin percentage and low volumes.","Bolthouse and Foodservice operating earnings increased 1%, primarily due to lower administrative expenses, the increase in sales and the benefit of the 53rd week probably offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased marketing for Bolthouse Farms.","International simple meals and beverages operating earnings decreased 2% to 106 millions in this fiscal year. The decrease was primarily driven by volume declines and the unfavorable impact of currency probably offset by lower administrative expenses, a higher gross margin percentage and lower selling expenses.","On the next slide you can see the sales performance of US soups excluding the estimated impact of the 53rd week. Sales declined 2% compared to the prior year in which soup sales rose 5%. Consumer takeaway measured channels also declined by 2% as soup inventory levels at retailers at year-end were comparable with 2013.","For the year, sales for condensed soups decreased 3% driven primarily by declines in eating varieties. Ready-to-serve soup sales declined 6%, with lower sales across the RTS portfolio. Broth had a very strong year with sales increasing by 8%, driven by strong marketing programs, innovations and distribution gains.","Year is a look at US wet soup category performance in the past year and our share performance as measured by IRI. For the 52 week period ending August 3, 2014, the category as a whole declined 1.1%. Our sales and measured channels decline 2% with low single-digit declines in condensed and ready-to-serve soups probably offset by high single-digit growth in broth.","Campbell had a 59% market share, a decrease of 50 basis points in the period. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28% with private label with at 13%. Cash flow from operations was 899 million compared with 1.19 billion in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to lower cash earnings and taxes paid on the divestiture of the European simple meals business probably offset by low working capital requirements.","Capital expenditures of 347 million increased from 336 million a year ago. Net debt decreased by 337 million to 3.783 billion.","Now, I\u2019ll talk about our fiscal 2015 guidance. As we\u2019ve stated, fiscal 2014 comprised 53 weeks, which includes one additional week. As shown on the chart, we estimate that the extra week benefited sales by two points, EBIT by three points, and EPS by $0.08 per share.","On a 52-week adjusted basis in 2014, we delivered 8.139 billion in sales, 1.244 billion in EBIT, and EPS of $2.45. These 52-week numbers are the base for our fiscal 2015 guidance. As we stated at our recent investor day, while we expect to achieve growth in 2015, we do not expect to achieve our long-term target growth rates.","For fiscal 2015, we expect continuing operations to grow sales by 1% to 2%, adjusted EBIT to go grow between 0% and 2%, and EPS to grow 0% to 2%, or $2.45 to $2.50 per share.","Turning to solve the key assumptions underlying our guidance, we expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 3% to 4%, driven by double-digit increases in dairy, meats and tomatoes. Cost inflation will be mostly offset by estimated productivity gains of 3% as a percentage of cost of products sold.","We expect our gross margin percentage to be comparable to last year, as we realize some gains in net pricing and wrap some one-time cost, most notably the Plum recall. The anticipated return of incentive compensation to targeted levels represents of four point headwind at EBIT or approximately $0.09 per share, the majority of which will flow-through our administrative expense line.","We expect that the benefit from our restructuring initiatives, including the program initiated in the fourth quarter will probably offset the incentive compensation impact. The effective tax rate is projected to be in the 31% to 32% range comparable to fiscal 2014. This guidance assumes a modest EPS contribution from share repurchases, as we anticipate resuming our strategic share repurchase program in 2015.","We forecast capital expenditures to increase by 50 million to approximately 400 million, as we increase funding for capacity expansion project for Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms, aseptic broth and our business in Indonesia.","As Denise has already mentioned, given our performance in the first half last year, we expect strong performance in the first quarter and softer performance in the second quarter, which should add up to a first half that\u2019s more consistent with our annual guidance. Thank you. And now I will turn it back to Jennifer.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks Anthony. At this time will conduct the Q&A session. We would likely to request that our callers limit themselves to a single question. If you have a second question, we invite you to re-enter the queue as we\u2019ll take double dippers after everyone else has had the opportunity to pose a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Denise just wondering if you could provide an update on the sauces strategy and maybe the products you\u2019re seeing in terms of retailers adopting these dedicated aisle merchandisers, and your expectations for the contribution of sauces to growth in fiscal \u201915.","Denise Morrison","Our sauces strategy is to continue to build pace brand. We have on the docket for F \u201815 some innovation and brand building programs. But most of the contribution from sauces will come from the growth in Prego, where we are continuing to expand our white sauces, and also the innovation in our Campbell\u2019s dinner sauces, where we have introduced Skillet and Slow Cooker sauces, and this year, we are introducing Oven sauces, and that platform continues to build.","We now have the majority of retailers giving us an extra four foot section in the stores as a destination for these particular sauces. So it\u2019s a very strong and profitable business for us.","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Denise in the prepared remarks, I think you made a comment about remaining committed to investing in the platforms for the long-term, but also having the willingness to take additional actions if industry headwinds accelerate. ","So just trying to get a sense of what you meant by those additional actions; is that a potential for just to be more thoughtful around marketing in the year, potentially or incremental restructuring or both or things beyond that, then I didn\u2019t mention thank you.","Denise Morrison","I think it\u2019s really important that the company, given the fact that we are still having challenges on our organic sales to continue to invest in these brands and to make sure that we are innovating, and that is going to take the investment that we have in our plans. ","However, given the volatility in the market place on some of the commodity issues that we\u2019re facing et cetera, we are constantly looking for additional opportunities for cost reduction and management of those margins. So that\u2019s what I was indicating their.","We believe that we\u2019ve got it balanced, but quite frankly, if there are surprises we will take extra action to make sure to deliver what we said we\u2019re going to do.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Got it. So a little less on marketing side, where I think you have mentioned even at your analyst day that does need to be, continued to be bolstered behind some of the new innovations and then maybe more on the cost side, potentially.","Denise Morrison","Correct. Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Maybe a little bit of a follow-up to Andrew\u2019s question for the long-term. And then I have kind of a detail numbers question. But on the long-term, why wouldn\u2019t and maybe this looks somewhat semantic, but why wouldn\u2019t you change your long-term targets either a little lower, given the environment and the inability to achieve them over the last three years or just say, okay, our long-term targets now include the assumption of M&A to stop.","Denise Morrison","The way we are looking at it Eric is, we need about a point more of sales and two points of EBIT growth to get to the bottom of the range, and when you think about the puts and takes that we\u2019re cycling in F \u201814, that give was about four points of EBIT pressure in F \u201815 with a net impact of about $45 million from supply chain cost and incentive compensation.","Without this headwind, EBIT would have been consistent with our long-term targets. So we have line of sight of how to get there. However, we are saying that there may be a call for more M&A to continue to diversify into faster growing spaces for sustainable achievement of those long-term targets.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Right. And then Anthony if I could just follow, I don\u2019t understand one thing you said about the fiscal \u201815 assumptions. Now you have already started out by saying that fiscal \u201815 is likely to be less than planned. ","So if the incentive comp of 45 million is that a portion of what you would have assumed if you had achieve the targets. I\u2019m just surprised that wouldn\u2019t the incentive comp headwinds be lower because you\u2019re already at the start of the year, assuming a less then average year.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Let me kill clarify Eric, what I said is that, our fiscal 2015 growth rate would be lower than our long-term target growth rates. Those growth rates in F \u201815 are more consistent with our internal plans.","And the 0% to 2% EBIT and EPS growth includes the negative headwind from returning incentive compensation to target levels, part of which is offset by restructuring benefits from the programs that we recently initiated.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","But I guess I just don\u2019t understand, if you are starting out the year, knowing that you\u2019re going to be below your long-term plan, and I realize your compositions a function of several plans or several different time periods. Why would you restate or accrue the comp that what I guess is essentially a normal year\u2019s level. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. You must be referring to the multi year programs and the annual plan resets every year, so that certainly goes back to target levels. The way the accruals work on the longer term ones is that you basically adjust to your current expectations, so that going forward, the increment is more consistent or closer to target.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay, maybe I\u2019ll follow up off-line. I\u2019ll pass up. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","I just wondered if I can get a little bit more color on the increase supply chain costs. I know the through the year you had those, I think weather in part was a factor. But seems like those continued in the fourth quarter as well. Can you give a little color on that, and does that pressing in your response to Andrew\u2019s question, in part, which you would be targeting if there was some more cost reduction activities.","Anthony DiSilvestro","On the fourth quarter, we had a couple of situations in the supply chain was relatively unique and different than the full-year impacts that we saw around, for example, the Plum recall the impact of the extreme weather on warehousing and distribution costs.","What we saw in the fourth quarter is really two things, and they both add up to being about a two point impact on gross margin quarter-over-quarter. The first is the timing of our fixed cost absorption, last year we had some favorability, this year we had some unfavorability rating.","It\u2019s a relatively small quarter, we are truing up some of our fixed cost reserves and what we saw was year-on-year negative impact on gross margins. And the second is on our open commodity hedges, so we take forward cover on the majority of our hedge able items, and what happened in the fourth quarter, the underlying prices of those commodities declined and so we had to record a loss on some of those open commodity hedges. ","So those two things happened in the fourth quarter, and again they are not really kind of a recurring thing which is why I added the comment that looking ahead we do expect 2015 gross margin percentage to be comparable to this year.","Denise Morrison","And Chris, just to build on that. In the fourth quarter last year, we were gearing up on launching Campbell\u2019s Homestyle soup. So that is something that we\u2019re cycling this year.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Denise Morrison","The absorption.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Just sticking with the soup category, you\u2019ve launched a wide range of new soups over the past few years, the Go soups, Slow Kettle, Bisques and so on, and yet the categories continues to decline, it seems. What have you learned from those new product launches over the years, and what makes line up for fiscal \u201815 more likely to succeed this time. Thank you.","Denise Morrison","Alexia what we\u2019re doing in the next year is two things, we are improving against our drivers of demand, but we are also investing more in broader platforms to improve total category performance. ","So each one of the things you listed in and of itself is a single initiative, but when you bundle that into a premium soup platform, we then will be building the expansion of Slow Kettle and the introduction of Campbell\u2019s Organic soup.","We\u2019re putting premium soup sections in stores, so that we know that the consumer for these particular product is younger and more affluent, so that gives us the range in value all the way from Condensed soup all the way up to a Premium soup and shelf-stable and then also in chilled, and so focusing on premium soup platform, we believe is a faster growing space for is within the soup category.","The second thing we are doing is, Swanson broth is giving us an expansion to a flavor infused platform, which is offering consumers a creative homing soup in meal solutions based on the insight of why I cook?","And then, within some of the brands we have platforms like pub-inspired Chunky or building out our Campbell\u2019s Homestyle and Healthy Request soup. So what we\u2019ve really learned is by bundling these into platforms, what we have to do is improve the total category performance, which has been declining,, and if you can do that by bringing new users into category we believe that\u2019s the best opportunity for growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Just a follow-up on soup for this upcoming year. What sort of year-over-year performance would expect simple meals and soups specifically similar to your overall top line guidance, and where I\u2019m going with this is, your innovation, marketing and renovation plans for this year, how would you characterize them versus \u201814, and what do you think of weather comparisons are they neutral or perhaps negative event for \u201815 as you are thinking ahead. Thanks.","Anthony DiSilvestro","He yes, I would say I don\u2019t want to give a specific forecast for simple meals, but as Denise said, we do expect soup to grow in 2014. We do expect growth from some of our other areas within simple meals. The challenge is that some of these core centre store categories have been sluggish of late, and that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s holding its back.","We will flex the marketing to focus against some of the innovation that\u2019s going on, so the launch of Oven sauce and the launch of organic soups, so will flex the marketing within there to do that. We expect pretty significant renovation, I mean Denise talked about 200 new SKUs, a lot of those fit inside the simple meals category. ","With regards to weather, I would say kind of neutral year-on-year, but don\u2019t really focused too much on that.","Denise Morrison","The only thing I would add is that, we typically plan our innovation at the average in the food business, and so if something performs better than average we get a benefit from that. But if something performs below that we believe that by planning to the average weekend balance out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America\/ Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America\/ Merrill Lynch","Maybe a broader question just trying to conceptualize a little bit where we stand or will go going forward in terms of the core business. I guess over the last few years, the challenging environment, the challenges have been really North America and I guess Australia, and it\u2019s been a combination of the economy or a weak consumer wallet and all the things that would drive that. ","And then we\u2019ve also got change in consumer case, I guess, from my perspective, it seems like early on it was more a weak wallet and less sort of consumer tastes and maybe that\u2019s changed now.","So can you just give is a sense for kind of, of those items which ones are really causing the most pressure today, and as you\u2019re going forward, which of those two do you think are the most important in addressing in terms of sort of getting the base to be where it needs in order to get ourselves back to the algorithm.","Denise Morrison","There are several factors, but I\u2019ll talk about two that are on our watch. The first one is the impact of snack, particularly on the recipients, they are about 12% of our shopper base and that\u2019s correlated to about 1% decline in sales.","There are about 19% of households in general, based on government data. IRI captures about 12% of them as they do their analysis. And our analysis shows that about 30% of our retail customer base is experiencing greater dollar declines among these households versus their total retail shoppers. So we are continuing to watch that.","The second is a shopping pattern of the next generation. We\u2019re watching the fact that 18 to 24-year-olds are not necessarily frequenting stores like their parents. Now, a lot of them live with their parents, so that might explain some of it. But as we dig deeper in it, some of them haven\u2019t even made any trips to either a club store or mass merchandiser in the last year.","So making sure that we are engaging this nice generation where they shop and how they are going to be engaging with brands is going to be very, very important. So those are the two things that we think are having a macro impact, there are more.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America\/ Merrill Lynch","But it\u2019s fair to say in the near-term, the longer term thing is getting the millennial I guess other people in the 20s to engage in the category more. But the more specific thing that turned in the near-term, which is simply be that financial pressure of the wallet.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, I would say being the finance guy that that weak wallet has a very significant impact. We\u2019re talking about our core category performance and probably something that we can affect the least, and it\u2019s certainly impacting some of our centre store categories.","Unlike the innovation thing we\u2019re doing a lot about innovation. Now, those things are more in our control, we understand where the consumer is going, we can bring new products. Denise talked about dinner sources, we have a new line of [VHUs] as that is more healthy, we have new varieties of Swanson and Chunky and Homestyle and Prego Vista.","All those things are addressing kind of where the consumer tastes is evolving. The hardest one for us to get at, obviously, is that weak wallet and the impact on our core categories.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","So you\u2019ve talked more recently about pulling back on some of the less productive promotional spending that you\u2019ve seen through the course of the year and shifting these dollars back to advertising, but with promotion about 2% headwind towards sales this quarter. I guess it wasn\u2019t clearly evident in Q4.","Were you able to make or have you been able to make these kinds of tactical adjustments you\u2019d hope to make 2 to 3 months ago, or is the competitive environment make it difficult to follow through on this.","Denise Morrison","Actually for F \u201815 we have made course corrections based on our F\u201814 results, and we\u2019ve worked with both depths and frequency depending upon the category and the competition we are facing, and obviously for competitive reasons, we don\u2019t disclose the specifics of our promotions, but we have like I said taken up learning and applied it.","In general, we aim to keep a total marketing spend, which is a combination of advertising consumer and trade, add about 25% of less sales. But the marketing mix is going to vary depending upon the brand and the category and the competitive set in that category.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","And then just to clarify with respect to some of the marketing and selling costs overall for the full-year, and my sense is that this should definitely be up year-on-year in absolute terms because of this course correction, but can you just confirm that that\u2019s the right way to think about it on a full-year basis, not necessarily quarter-to-quarter.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. Denise was referring to our total marketing so advertising, consumer and trade spending, not the selling and marketing line on the P&L and trying to keep it around 24% to 25% of their sales. I wouldn\u2019t expect any significant changes in those percentages year-on-year or \u201815 versus \u201914. Maybe some slight changes within them, but nothing significant.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","I want to drill down a little bit more on gross margin, I think, at least for me that was the biggest surprise in the quarter. Can you help us quantify the Plum recall expenses as well as the other supply chain expenses or I would guess the mark-to-market charges that hit you this year.","Then bigger question thinking forward into next year, you are guiding for inflation to modestly outstrip productivity, as I think now it was getting at net pricing at our promotions has been eroding into the new fiscal year, and you had this mix issue within your P&L presumably as soup sales lag and some of your lower margin or faster growth piece of the portfolio becoming a bigger piece. So in context to all that, how are we comfortable gross margins being flat in fiscal \u201915.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Okay, I can address that because with any planning cycles there are certainly puts and takes. In this year, we had the Plum recall that was worth $16 million as we\u2019ve discussed. In the four quarters, we had this issue around losses on open commodity contracts, both of those are going to turn and go the other way in 2015, but there has been some one-offs or takes in 2015, as well. ","Most of that Plum recall wrap is going to be offset by unfavorable currency movement at the transaction level. So, imports into both Canada and Australia are adversely impacted by the weakening of those currencies. ","So there are a number of pluses and minuses that kind of net out with the exception of the incentive compensation headwind and we\u2019ve talked about that that\u2019s $45 million. A good portion of that $45 million is going to be offset by the benefit of our restructuring programs.","We had three quarters this year, where we\u2019ve announced restructuring initiatives, combined when we fully implement those it\u2019s worth 65 million, we won\u2019t get all that in F \u201815, but we\u2019ll get a good portion of that. So we\u2019re trying to mitigate that impact, and again we have a number of puts and takes and they kind of all balance out with the exception of that one big one.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Switching gears, Denise to you on M&A, you\u2019ve kind of hinted that maybe M&A is on the cards, but you put out this $10 billion sales bogey in five years, and even given your credits for pretty healthy acceleration to your underlying portfolio. You\u2019re going to come easily $1 billion plus short of that without M&N.","So A, is that the right way to think about it, and then B, as we contemplate up to 1 billion or more of acquired sales: next five years, how do we think about your prioritization in terms of buying businesses that accelerate long-term growth to your portfolio versus buying businesses that can have a meaningful impact on both the top and bottom line right out of the gates.","Denise Morrison","Well, we continue to evaluate M&A targets that are a good strategic fit, but we have a very disciplined approach. So I don\u2019t want to take away the [b\u2019s] that we\u2019re going to be reckless about this. We definitely have been looking at specific targets, but we\u2019ve walked away from more than we made. ","So the prioritization will be about the places that we\u2019ve picked being the global baking and snacking area, the packaged fresh area, health and wellness in North America. Those are the three areas that we believe that they are faster growing spaces for us based on the strategy that we\u2019ve laid out.","And we do have the financial flexibility to make a meaningful acquisition, but like I said, we are being very disciplined about it.","Anthony DiSilvestro","If I could just add to that, I mean certainly M&A, can play a role as you\u2019ve seen us deal with Bolthouse and Plum and Kelsen in terms of improving our growth profile and we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to do that. ","But we also recognize that in terms of value creation the best thing we can do is improve the performance of our base business. And Denise has talked about the dual mandate, we are focused on expanding in the higher growth spaces with innovation and packaged fresh and availability in the international business that we do own.","So it\u2019s a combination of improving the base and expanding through M&A that will get us to that $10 billion target.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks a lot guys, I\u2019ll pass it on.","Denise Morrison","I know we are at the hour , but we\u2019ll keep going because we still have a few people in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","I wanted to ask about Denise\u2019s comments about four pillars to accelerate growth in particular, the move in to some non-traditional channels, and I am particularly interested in, promo spending has been pretty inefficient, most of your peers have said the same and you even commented about (inaudible) not shopping the way their parents do. ","So I guess my question\u2019s really, as promo hasn\u2019t really produced the volume lift can you first of all quantify what percentage of your sales is coming from these alternative channels and then can you talk a little bit about how you will go about getting into say C- stores or clubs, or maybe you could just give us a few more details on kind of what\u2019s behind that comment, and then obviously those channels are pretty competitive. ","So if you could just explain that up a little bit. I would be very interested in hearing that thank you.","Denise Morrison","Well, we have a majority of our business still concentrated largely in grocery and mass merchandiser which gives us lots of opportunity for expansion in other channels, and we believe that we need to make a concerted effort to do so.","We have expanded our sales presence and our programming across multiple channels and we are also paying attention to the e-commerce space with many of our large customers and so we are doing a better job in terms of tailoring programs in some of these new spaces. So we\u2019re not highly efficient right out of the gate, but we are learning and getting better at it.","I think most of the promotional situations that we have though this year was more in our traditional channels, and we were working more with frequency and less depths and in some categories like baked snacks and soup that didn\u2019t work as well as we expected it to. So we are of course correcting.","Anthony DiSilvestro","We have a very significant initiative against the immediate consumption channels that we\u2019ve talked about as we develop our own router to market network. At this point we have over 100 new distributors signed up. That transition is largely complete, we\u2019ve got over hundred thousand doors in terms of coverage and we expect to see some growth coming from this initiative, probably by the second-quarter of fiscal \u201915.","Denise Morrison","And the original focus on that is beverage from both V8 and Bolthouse Farms.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","Okay, thank you for the additional color.","Denise Morrison","Yes, and I think our estimate routing that channels Diane is about 10% somewhere in there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Driscoll - Citi","Thanks for taking the question, I see the hour show. I\u2019ll be direct here, I wanted to just talk a little bit about the gross margins. When I look really big picture at Campbell\u2019s Soup in more than 10 years of data, Denise, we haven\u2019t seen a gross margin like this. I mean 35.4%, it\u2019s remarkable in respect to what Campbell has produced for so many years.","I also believe that at the beginning of the year you guys thought that the gross margin would actually be kind of flattish on the year end and it was down 190 basis points. So there are a lot of things that have really happened that I think were not easily predictable by the team.","The point in the question is, can adjust discuss why gross margins wouldn\u2019t have significant risk to the downside ongoing for the very same factors that kind of drove the F \u201814 numbers. And is it simply all about this 65 million in savings, is that the lifeline that we are hoping that really stabilizes gross margins, thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Guess I think the first is we certainly acknowledge what has happened to our gross margin over the last couple of years, and the principal driver of that has been an increase in trade rates, and it has to do with the environment, it has to do with a couple of a businesses, namely US soup in Australia and more recently in Pepperidge Farm.","And I think the difference, and certainly it is a challenging goal, we acknowledge that. But we also acknowledge in order for us to hit our financial targets, we need to do a better job at managing this trade rate closer to flat.","We have plans to that in 2015 with a combination of changes promote price points that something that we didn\u2019t have coming into this year, so that has a direct and immediate impact on the amount of trade. We have adjustment to the frequency and around specific promotional events continuing to learn in terms of what programs are more productive versus less productive, and that to reallocate within the portfolio.","I think most of the challenge in Australia is fully behind us, we have specific plans to address the issue of late within Pepperidge Farm. So as we look across the portfolio, and again, its going to very by category, but we are looking to hold the trade rate relatively flat, and it is a challenge but that\u2019s our plan and what we are trying to do in 2015, because we know how critical it is to the gross margin to get this trade rate back to flattish.","David Driscoll - Citi","I mean to state the obvious, it\u2019s unsettling to see these gross margins do what they are doing and then to have confidence in the model. Certainly \u201815 will be critical. Can you describe or quantify the size of the commodity impacts for the open hedge position that it took in the fourth quarter.","If I\u2019m correct, that\u2019s a reversible item. So what will happen is as you actually recognize those the actual transactions through F\u201815. What was the headwind in the fourth quarter will become a tailwind within the operating segments as the course of \u201815 plays through and the hedges are used up.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, somebody studied hedge accounting, it\u2019s about $10 million.","David Driscoll - Citi","It\u2019s 10 million bucks, and then I would go back to Eric\u2019s question just to speed it. I think I want to state it simply, the $45 million of incentive comp that you built back into the plan, I think what Eric was getting at is, kind of why does all 45 million get back into the budget for the year when the expectation is that the company will not achieved its long-term targets. I mean it\u2019s in simple form, and he doesn\u2019t mean to come across that harsh. ","I mean Denise, may be the right answer is, you just have to pay the team in order to keep the team. I think we all just kind of want to understand the philosophy on the 45 million and what it takes to maintain the excitement of the people running the business.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Let me jump in first here and then Denise can come at it if she\u2019d like. Thanks for the second attempt here at an answer. Think about it as two parts, again there is an annual incentive plan which kind of resets each year and then there is long term targets that will increase year-on-year, but do not get back to 100% pay out. ","So, the annual incentive goes back to target, the long terms ones will go up next year, but they don\u2019t go anywhere near a 100%, if they are set against our long term sales and EPS targets.","Denise Morrison","We definitely have pay for performance compensation system, and with sales goals that are higher than our guidance. I think we have time for one more question. ","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo","Very simply on the balance sheet, you had $700 million of debt that matured in August, and I think you had capacity to refinance that with commercial paper, and I guess my question is really two-fold. First of all, would you look to refinance a portion of that in the debt capital markets to term out a portion of your floating rate debt, and in terms of capital allocation priorities, do you continue to be focused somewhat on debt reduction for FY \u201915.","Anthony DiSilvestro","I can take that. In F\u201914 we had $700 million of long term debt maturing. We also had cash flow that enabled us to reduce our total debt levels by $300 million to $400 million. So one of them has been just paid off with cash from operations, and the other as you pointed out, refinance with commercial paper.","As you know, we have pretty access to capital markets, so we are continuing to evaluate opportunities to come to market. We don\u2019t have a specific plan to share with you today on that, but again we are looking at that pretty closely. ","In terms of capital allocation priorities, not much has changed there. Obviously our first priority is to fund our ongoing business, the second would be dividends, third, M&A and the last would be share repurchases. ","What\u2019s changing in F\u201915 is that we are going resume in a modest fashion a return to share repurchases, get a little bit of EPS benefit in F\u201915, but that would be the only change for us going forward.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to your host, Ken Gosnell. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Gosnell","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning everyone. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup\u2019s Fiscal 2017. With me here in New Jersey, are Denise Morrison, President and CEO and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO.","As usual, we created slides to accompany our earnings presentation.

Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.","With that, let me turn the call over to Denise.","Denise Morrison","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. I look forward to reviewing and discussing our results with you this morning. I\u2019ll start with a high-level overview and then provide my perspective on each division\u2019s performance. Anthony will follow with the detailed financial results, but first, let me start with some contacts about the external environment.","In the United States, the length and tenor of the President show campaign was unprecedented. There are many important issues, the new administration will address that will impact the food industry including tax policy, regulations, trade agreement, new leadership of the UFDA and FDA, as well as the upcoming farm bill.","Meanwhile, the seismic shift that I had outlined in our previous discussions continue to impact our industry including a shrinking middle-class, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health and well being and a continued evolution of digital media and e-commerce channels.","Across the industry, top-line growth remains sluggish, particularly in center-store categories. Simultaneously, food deflation is pressuring both top and bottom lines and limiting pricing opportunities. This is driving a hypercompetitive environment for market share along with a continued focus on cost savings measures to deliver earnings.","As we\u2019ve seen, many food companies have reported flat to declining organic sales in their most recent quarters. And that pressure is not limited to manufacturers; retailers too are taking actions to reposition themselves for growth through consolidation, management changes and increased investments in e-commerce.","With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results. Relative to our expectations, I\u2019m encouraged by our overall performance, we\u2019re executing against the plans we described in September, we expanded gross margin and delivered adjusted EBIT and EPS growth cycling a strong year ago quarter. Organic sales decreased 1% in the quarter driven by declines in our Campbell Fresh business, which we expected and which we communicated in early September.","Additionally, we remain on-track to achieve our $300 million cost savings goal by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we\u2019re reinvesting across the business to drive top line growth including increased advertising support of Chunky Soup and Pepper Farm\u2019s Goldfish Crackers expanding our digital and e-commerce capabilities and funding long-term innovation initiatives.","Given our start and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we reaffirmed our full-year guidance this morning. Let me now offer my perspective on the performance of each of our three divisions. Let\u2019s start with America\u2019s simple Meals and Beverages, our largest division. As a reminder, this division\u2019s portfolio role is to deliver moderate growth consisted with the categories in which we operate and to expand margins.","Our sales were mixed this quarter, however the division delivered strong operating earnings, and I continue to be pleased with the gross margin expansion driven by the improved performance of our supply chain. I\u2019m optimistic about the start to the soup season. U.S. Soup sales were comparable to a year ago, which reflects an improvement in trend. Sales of RTS Soup and broth increased while condensed sales declined slightly.","Campbell\u2019s consumption outpaced the category largely driven by the performance of the RTS portfolio. Chunky led the way, as we dramatically improved our execution. We have corrected the labeling misstep from last year, being airing a new integrated NFL theme campaign and introduced new stackable cans that are driving increased merchandizing opportunities at major customers.","It\u2019s also important to note that we\u2019re cycling net price realization gains that has held in the marketplace. All of this is resulting in improved performance.","Looking ahead on soup, we continue to expect to deliver modest growth for the full-year behind improved performance in Chunky, strong holiday plans for both condensed soups and broth and the upcoming launch of Well Yes RTS soup line.","This new clean-label soup is made with nutritious recognizable and desirable ingredients and we\u2019ll begin shipping in December. The response from retailers has been overwhelmingly positive and we have a robust integrated marketing plan to fuel the launch.","In other parts of the portfolio, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum with growth in the core pouch portfolio, as well as the introduction of Plum organic infant formula. However, our shelf-stable beverage portfolio remains challenged. Specifically V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash.","On the positive side, V8 + Energy continues to perform well and we\u2019re seeing improving trends in V8 Red following our discussion to increase advertising support. As we previously stated, we do not expect V8 to grow in fiscal 2017.","While we have more work ahead, I\u2019m encouraged by the start to the year especially in U.S. soup and I'm confident in our plans. In short, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division continues to deliver against this portfolio role.","Now let\u2019s turn to Global Biscuits and Snacks. As a reminder, this division includes our Pepperidge Farm Arnott\u2019s and Kelsen businesses and its portfolio role is to expand and develop in developing markets while improving margins.","Sales growth in the quarter was driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong performance of Goldfish Crackers and Milano Cookies. Operating earnings decreased 2% as we invested in increased advertising.","In the U.S., the team delivered sales and share gains in both Goldfish Crackers and Milano Cookies. Goldfish benefited from increased advertising investment, channel gains leveraging multiple pack sizes and innovative new products.","Our efforts to expand our health and well-being offerings are performing well. Both multi-grain Goldfish and Goldfish made with organic wheat contributed to the sales gains.","At Investor Day, we shared our plans to focus on building brand equity and increasing our marketing investments in our cooking portfolio and we\u2019re beginning to see results. Effective new advertising and flavor innovation drove sales and consumption gains for Milano cookies.","Sales and fresh bakery decline in the quarter in the base of intensify competitive activity and we have taken steps to address this with improved innovation and quality on our Pepperidge Farm\u2019s swirl bread.","Looking ahead in the U.S., we\u2019re focused on driving growth in Goldfish, increase innovation and cookies including the re-launch of our Pepperidge Farm\u2019s American Classic Cookie line and the new fresh bakery quality improvements to take hold in the market. Additionally, expanding both Tim Tam distribution and our West Coast Bakery operations remain top priorities.","Turning to other parts of the world. In Southeast Asia, we maintained our momentum in Malaysia behind strong sales of sauces, but sales in Indonesia were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive activities in the general trade.","In Australia, we delivered sales growth in biscuits driven by strong performance and our chocolate biscuit portfolio despite declines in Shapes crackers. We\u2019ve taken action to address Shapes\u2019 performance and we\u2019re beginning to see signs of improvement.","Looking ahead, we\u2019re focused on delivering consumer driven product innovation in TIM TAM Chocolate Biscuits with the new range of seasonal varieties. We also expect our Shapes\u2019 performance to accelerate behind our new marketing campaign highlighting both new and original recipes.","Finally, I\u2019ll discuss our Campbell Fresh division. The CPG portion of C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms\u2019 Beverages and Salad Dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and chips and our refrigerated soups. The farms portion of the portfolio includes carrot and natural ingredients.","As a reminder, C-Fresh is a strategically important business to Campbell, it addresses the key consumer trend towards fresh foods and health and wealth being and its brands resonates menial consumers.","The business performed as expected to the start of the year, as we\u2019re continuing to execute the recovery plans related to the voluntary product recall of Bolthouse Farms\u2019 Protein PLUS drinks and the carrot quality and execution issues we experienced in fiscal 2016.","As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we installed a new leadership team and have increased the integration and oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain. There have been other changes since then.","As previously announced, Jeff Dunn left the company in October and we named Ed Carolan President of Campbell Fresh. Ed has been with Campbell since 2001, in a variety of leadership roles including the President of U.S. Retail Soup and Beverages.","Most recently, he was President of Integrated Global Services were he created and implemented a business model to build new capabilities and deliver faster and more efficient services. Ed and the Campbell Fresh leadership team are focused on returning the business to growth starting in the second half of the year.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at what drove the declines in the first quarter, and our continued recovery from the Protein PLUS beverage recall and the carrot quality and execution issues. First beverages, as we discussed in the fourth quarter, we identified and corrected the primary cause of last year\u2019s Protein PLUS recall and implemented enhanced processes to improve quality standards.","While we\u2019re making progress, we still continue to expect that Protein PLUS supply will be negatively impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016. Our objective is to meet demand through a combination of improved run-rates increased in-house capacity and adding co-packers. Following the recall, we have been steadily increasing production capacity while also working hard to improve our customer service levels.","We\u2019ve made solid progress in the first quarter in improving our runtimes. To increase capacity we\u2019re in the process of installing a new beverage line in our Bakersfield plant, which we expect will be commissioned by the end of the calendar year.","Performance was mixed in other parts of the Campbell Fresh CPG portfolio, in the ultra premium category, sales growth of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms\u2019 Cold-Pressed Juice was driven by increased distribution and share gains. Sales of Bolthouse Farms\u2019 Salad Dressing also continue to grow.","Turning to Garden Fresh Gourmet, sales of hummus and salsa declined in the quarter. The team is focused on further product differentiation through regional flavors as we continue to execute our plans to expand Garden Fresh Gourmet beyond the mid-West.","Another bright spot was the performance of Retail Fresh Soup. Sales increased in the quarter with the introduction of new branded Garden Fresh Gourmet soup, which has been well received by customers.","Now, turning to the Farms business. We are stabilizing our carrot operations and improved quality. The team remains focused on service levels and working to regain lost customer\u2019s overtime. We expect the recovery to continue throughout the year as we demonstrate to customers our ability to deliver sustain quality.","While we\u2019re making progress, we clearly have more work ahead to get this division back to performing in line with its portfolio roll of full-force growth. For the full-year, we continue to expect Campbell fresh sales to grow in the low single-digits.","Before closing, I want to touch upon our efforts to create new models of innovation to define the future of real foods and drive growth in new ways for Campbell. As I discussed with you in the past, new models continue to emerge and new start-up companies are being fueled by an influx of venture capital.","Campbell is now more fully participating in venture opportunities through Acre Venture Partners and independently managed a $125 million venture fund where Campbell is the so limited partner. Acre is investing in a number of promising and innovative food and food related companies.","At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we funded $41 million out of our $125 million commitment. Another example of how we\u2019re investing our cost savings into long-term innovation is a new start-up company called [Habit] (Ph). A business backed by Campbell and led by Neil Grimmer the co-founder of Plum.","Positioned at the intersection of health and well-being technology and food Habit will leverage individualized data to create personalize nutrition and Neil plans for people, who want to harness the transformative power of food to improve their life. Stay tuned, we will be sharing additional details about Habit at CAGNY in February.","Finally, we continue to build a robust pipeline of internal innovation focused on the large and growing consumer platforms of health and well-being and snacking. And we\u2019re also continuing to pursue smart external development to diversify our portfolio and in these faster growing spaces.","Given our expectations and plans for the year, we\u2019re satisfied with our performance to start the year and confident in our plans for fiscal 2017. We continue to take action to strengthen our core business while also driving growth for the long-term to our purpose, growth agenda and strategic imperative.","One real food transparency and sustainability; two, digital and e-commerce; three, health and well-being and four, snacking. All while continuing to build a high performance organization focused on talent and culture and transforming the way we work.","In summary, these unpredictable and uncertain times in which we live are marked by sweeping changes across the food industry landscape. At Campbell, we are guided by our purpose, real food that matters for life\u2019s moments and focused on meeting the needs of our consumers helping our customers grow their business and increasing shareholder value for our investors.","Now, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro for an overview of our financial results.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks, Denise. And good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise stated, organic sales while down we\u2019re in-line with our expectations.","We anticipated our first quarter sales to be under some pressure as we begin to recover from the capacity constraints on Bolthouse Farm beverages and stabilized the carrot business. Overall, US soup sales were flat and we were pleased with the performance of Chunky, which is responding well to our marketing programs.","Our adjusted gross margin expanded 120 basis points, as our supply chain performed well and delivered significant productivity improvements, while cost inflations remained moderate.","We continue to make strong progress against our cost savings target of $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018, delivering about $35 million of incremental savings in the first quarter bringing the program to-date total to $250 million.","We adopted a new accounting standards that impacts the recognition of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation, the tax rate for the quarter reflected a $6 million tax benefit related to the change.","We are pleased with our first quarter start and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance that we announced in September.","Now, I\u2019ll review our results in more detail. On an as reported basis, net sales of $2,202 billion were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, organic net sales declined 1% driven by declines in Campbell Fresh partly offset by gain in Global Biscuits and Snacks.","Adjusted EBIT increased 1% to 486 million as a benefit of a higher adjusted gross margin percentage and lower administrative expenses were partly offset by increased the marketing and selling expenses. Adjusted EPS increased 5% or $0.05 to $1 per share.","Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, organic sales declined 1% driven by one point decline from volume and mix. Net price realization both pricing and promotion was stable for the quarter compared to last year.","Offsetting the organic sales decline was a one point favorable impact from currency translation principally the Australian dollar resulting in net sales being comparable to the prior year.","Our adjusted gross margin increased 120 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 70 basis points. Cost inflation on a rate basis, increased by about 1.5%. In addition, cost of product sold reflects higher cost in our C-Fresh division. These negative drivers were partly offset by the benefits from our cost savings initiatives.","Reflecting the increase promotional spending in Pepperidge Farm to support Goldfish and Fresh Bakery and in Indonesia to remain competitive promotional spending had a 20 basis point negative impact, which was offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points primarily from our retail business in Canada.","Mix was slightly favorable adding 20 basis points reflecting the sales decline in our lower margins the Fresh segment.","Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to $300 million cost savings program, contributed 170 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. All-in, our gross margin percentage increased 120 basis points, the 39.1%.","Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 11% in the quarter, primarily due to the higher advertising expenses as we reinvest in our key brands, as well as higher selling expenses due largely to timing.","The increased in advertising was primarily driven by increased support on Chunky Soup behind the new advertising campaign and on Pepperidge Farm\u2019s Goldfish Crackers. Adjusted administrative expenses decline 4% reflecting the benefit of our cost savings initiatives partially offset by inflation and investments we are making in longer term innovation.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below the line item. Adjusted EPS increased $0.05 from $0.95 in the prior year to $1 per share in the current quarter.","On a currency neutral basis, increases in adjusted EBIT had a $0.01 benefit on EPS. Share repurchases lowered our share count also adding a penny benefit. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter decreased by two points to 32.1%. The decrease in the tax rate contributed $0.03 the EPS growth including the benefit from the change in accounting for stock based compensation.","Interest was comparable to the prior year as the impact of higher interest rates was offset by lower debt level. While slightly favorable, the currency translation benefit rounds to no impact competing the bridge to $1 per share.","Now, turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to the prior year at $1.297 billion as double-digit gains in Plum products were offset by declines in V8 beverages.","Sales of U.S. soups were comparable to the prior year as gains in ready-to-serve soups, primarily Chunky benefiting from increased marketing support and broth were offset by modest decline in condensed soups.","Delivering against this portfolio role, operating earnings increased 6% reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven primarily by productivity improvements partially offset by increased marketing and selling expense.","Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending October 30, 2016, the category as a whole declined 2.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2.7%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve partly offset by strength in broth.","Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period declining 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 30 basis points finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, down 10 basis points.","In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 1%, driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm and strong growth in Goldfish Crackers, which benefited from increased advertising and promotional activity as well as new items.","Operating earnings declined 2% to $112 million driven primarily by higher advertising expenses partly offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. The segment gross margin percentage was comparable to last year as the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvement.","In the Campbell Fresh segment, as expected organic sales declined 6% reflecting the clients in Bolthouse Farms\u2019 beverages due to capacity constraints following the recall of Protein PLUS strength in June 2016; as well as declines in carrot and softness in Garden Fresh Gourmet partly offset by gains in refrigerated soups.","Lower carrot sales reflects a market share impact of quality and application issues from last fiscal year. Operating earnings declined by $17 million to $1 million reflecting higher carrot cost which were associated with lower volumes and improved quality, the cost impact of lower beverage operating efficiency and the impact of lower sales. As we\u2019ve previously stated, we expect a return to growth in C-Fresh starting in the second half of the fiscal year.","Cash flow from operations was $221 million, $23 million lower than the prior year, the decline reflects lower tax earnings and higher working capital requirement. Capital expenditures declined $23 million to $48 million. We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2017.","We paid dividends totaling $100 million reflecting a quarterly dividend rate of $31.02 per share. In September, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.35 per share, which from a cash flow perspective will be reflected in the second quarter.","In aggregate, we repurchase $112 million of share, 100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program as we\u2019ve increased our level of share repurchases. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity based compensation.","Net debts declined by $522 million compared to a year ago level as cash from operations over the last four quarters was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividend and share repurchases.","Now, I\u2019ll review our 2017 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we announced in September. The company expects sales to grow by zero to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4%, and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes based on current exchange rate that the impact from currency translation will be nominal.","We expect gross margin to improve slightly for the year, while inflation on core ingredients the team have moderated we expect inflation and cost to product sold of approximately 2%. On our cost savings program, we are ahead of our expectations having generated $35 million in the first quarter, against our full-year estimate of $50 million.","Its early in the year, so before making any changes to the savings estimate or full-year guidance, we would like to see how our cost savings developed in the second quarter, assess the performance of the business, especially C-Fresh and evaluate potential reinvestment opportunities.","Our EPS guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, which includes the changing accounting and from a favorable impact of anticipated share repurchases over the course of the year.","That concludes my remarks and now I\u2019ll turn it back to Ken for Q&A.","Kenneth Gosnell","Thanks Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time, and fairness to the other callers, please ask only one question at a time okay? operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Denise Morrison","Hi Andrew.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi. Quick question on gross margin, which I think, did come in quite a bit better than at least we had forecast in the quarter. Still looking for moderate gross margin expansion for the full-year. Given the rate of expansions 1Q Anthony.","I guess what at this stage would cause that rate of expansion in the next couple of quarters to moderate a bit on a year-over-year basis. Or and did the P&L impact of the incremental cost saves split out among cost of products and SG&A roughly evenly as I think you may have mentioned previously? Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","So Andrew I could say there is a couple of points. Of the $35 million, the majority of those cost savings in Q1 were within the supply chain therefore on the cost of products sold and the balance I would say it\u2019s primarily within administrative expenses. We are certainly please with the gross margin performance in the quarter, we are a little bit ahead of our expectations.","And as a couple of things, we see unfolding in the balance of the year. We are benefiting on our core ingredients and packaging items a little bit of deflation in the first quarter. And we see that swing to more neutral to slightly positive in the back half.","There is primarily three big ones. One is steel can, the other is dairy products we are currently ramping the impact of baby and flu and wheat prices, which are currently in deflation and we expect that also to be more neutral.","So we see a little bit of a swing front half to back half. The other thing we anticipate as we unfold some of our real food investments, we are removing artificial colors and ingredients. We are removing BPA from our can liners and those costs are going to accelerate as we go through the second half of the year relatively to the first half.","So we see a couple of headwinds ahead. Again, we feel good about our first quarter; we will see how the second quarter unfolds and make an assessment then.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you so much.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Grainger","Hi thanks everyone. Hi Happy Thanksgiving. Denise, I guess, I wanted to come back to Global Biscuits and ask a little bit more specifically about the performance of Pepperidge in U.S., which based on scanner data, seems to be carrying some pretty significant momentum at the moment.","Could you just elaborate a little bit on how that business performed in the quarter relative to the overall segment growth and just tactically what is going on that\u2019s enabling you to gain so much market share at the momentum. How sustainable that is and the way you are saving investments against those products at the moment?","Denise Morrison","Yes. We definitely invested in Pepperidge Farm this quarter, particularly in Goldfish and Milano Cookies and both of them have had really nice consumption gains relative to the categories. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest in Pepperidge Farm. One of the places where we have momentum brewing is in the American Classic Cookie; we\u2019re going to be re-launching a new product there.","So, we believe that on top of the Milano momentum we can fuel it with the American Classic. Now, the one place where we are experiencing declines is in Fresh Bakery as the competitive environment has heated up, but we\u2019ve introduced a new improved swirl bread and we\u2019ll be investing against that.","So only other two things are the expansion of Tim Tam in the United States, which we\u2019re really excited about and that campaign starts in January, we\u2019re building distribution as we speak. And then, moving after the successful expansion of our bakery business in the Arizona market, we\u2019re expanding into a couple of other west markets. So lots of activity on Pepperidge Farm.","Matthew Grainger","Okay and just from a savings perspective, as some of the ANC investment shifts until Well Yes and maybe a bit over toward simple meals in Q2. Should we see the balance shift a bit between the segments, is this more of kind of a concentrated spiking and some of the reinvestment going against Pepperidge business?","Denise Morrison","Yes. I would say that we\u2019re being very consistent with our plans, and we definitely prioritize our investments. I think where you will see a shift is more off smaller niche brands and back more on to the core brands, which we\u2019re including the launch of Well Yes as a key RTS initiative as well as the investment in Pepperidge Farm.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Great. Thanks Denise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Just a question about the U.S. Soups business, and just in the quarter sales were comparable and I think in the Nielsen Data at least I think it looks like in the 12-week period sales were down. So is there any mismatch in terms of timing of shipment versus consumption? And then I guess related to that as we\u2019re thinking about Q2, will Well Yes ship in Q2 or does it ship in Q3?","Denise Morrison","Okay. I\u2019ll take the first part. I guess the best way to explain it is we started our marketing this year in October. So on U.S. Soups we definitely saw a tick up in consumption and in sales at the later part of the quarter and expect that momentum to continue. Inventory this quarter was very comparable to a year ago, and although retailers are still tight on inventory, it wasn\u2019t a meaningful or material shift.","So I think the main issues with U.S. Soup are we saw at Chunky rebound particularly towards the later of the quarter against the marketing effort. We\u2019ve been able to hold our price realization on Chunky. And again, we\u2019re cycling some poor execution issues in the prior year. So we\u2019re very happy to see the response of Chunky.","Broth has been under a little bit of pressure, but we have big holiday plans. And so we\u2019re very confident in our holiday plans on broth. So I think it shaping up to be a season very much as we expected. Well Yes starts shipping in December, and so the customer acceptance has been great and so we have a huge Campbell launch on this one, so very excited about that.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. So it sounds like, assuming that you get consumer pull-through and Q2, there is no meaningful sort of discrepancy between takeaway and shipment as we\u2019re modeling forward?","Denise Morrison","That is correct.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, great. All right, thank you, Happy Thanksgiving everyone.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Same to you Bryan.","Denise Morrison","Thank you. You too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Denise Morrison","Hello Ken.","Kenneth Goldman","Hi good morning everyone. Hey how are you Denise? How are you everyone? Anthony, I just wanted to follow-up on the guidance for cost savings for the year. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I think the guidance was $50 million and you did $35 million in the first quarter. I know it\u2019s earlier, how are your progresses.","But I\u2019m curious, what would hold the savings back from surpassing that $50 million, you mentioned reinvestments. I thought the $50 million was a gross number prior to reinvestments. But again, just trying to get a little bit of color there and see maybe where some headwinds are that I\u2019m not maybe visualizing right now?","Anthony DiSilvestro","No, I think you have got it right. I mean gain the $50 million was a growth target, perhaps we\u2019re a little conservative as we did achieve $35 million of that in the first quarter. So we do want to see another quarter unfold, making sure it\u2019s not just timing, but we feel really good about where we are and if all goes well, we could have a little more savings available to us.","The other thing we want sometime is to see how the other business is progress, we\u2019ve got a big turnaround and C-Fresh that we\u2019re forecasting and also we\u2019ve identified some additional reinvestment opportunities.","So before making any decisions about \u201chey we\u2019ve got more cost savings, it\u2019s going to drop to the bottom-line,\u201d we do really want to evaluate other opportunities that we have for reinvestment and we just need a little more time to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Denise Morrison","Hi Chris.","Christopher Growe","Hi. Good morning. And my Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families as well. Just a question for you in relation to C-Fresh. So we soft first half that we\u2019ve expected and you showed start of that here in the first quarter. Is that business needs to grow all it 5% across the remainder of the year.","So I just want to understand your expectations that business and is it about getting back on shelf for Protein PLUS, as well as gaining care of customers back. So is there of those that\u2019s more the main drive here that could lead you to low single-digit growth for that division for the year?","Denise Morrison","Yes. I mean you have correct, we expect to be down in the first half and return to growth in the second half. Our shelf is building now for Protein PLUS and our service levels have gotten quite better. Although, we still have more to do.","I think the main other driver is the fact that because we\u2019ve been on allocation and we\u2019re basically supplying the shelf stock, we had not been merchandising. And in some cases retailers are not merchandising the whole line.","So we think that\u2019s affecting both our performance and also the category performance. But when we get to the second half, we should be in a position where we\u2019re not only supplying the shelf stock, but we\u2019re also able to supply merchandising stock, we\u2019re literally selling everything we make.","Christopher Growe","Okay. And just to understand the opportunity around regain care of customers. Are those expected to come back in the second half of the year? Is that quick or is this something happens overtime?","Denise Morrison","That absolutely happens overtime. The good news is that our quality is improving, and we believe that as customer see us at the same quality we will gain our business back. So we are going to have to earn it.","Christopher Growe","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thank you.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Rob.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Denise, in your opening remarks you mentioned the competitive environment getting tougher the retailers becoming more aggressive in promoting to be competitive with each other. Have you seen anything dramatically different over the past three months compared to maybe three months ago? Or are you specifically kind of talking about one category fresh bread.","Because I would argue in your soup business, it didn\u2019t seem like you needed to be particularly promotional, and I would argue that lot of your competitors in shelf stable food have been trying to reduce the promotional intensity. Had something changed in that regard?","Denise Morrison","I think your observation in some of our categories is correct, we\u2019re finding that our categories are pretty stable when it comes to food deflation, but we aren\u2019t seeing some refrigerated food and beverages categories experiencing food deflation of about 3.4% in the last 13-weeks serving predominantly by dairy and refrigerated meats.","Although our categories are relatively stable, we\u2019re still dealing with the central store that\u2019s growing about zero to 1%, and therefore growth is hard one and it becomes a market share gain. So those are just observation I\u2019m sharing that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean its driving crazy behavior. But it is definitely a dynamic that we\u2019re dealing with.","Anthony DiSilvestro","just to add to Denise\u2019s comment, I would say in Italian soft we\u2019re seeing increased level of competitive activity. And also within soup on broth, we\u2019re seeing increase activity on private labels specifically around price competition there.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Does that sound transitory to you, Anthony or do you think that\u2019s going to be throughout the year. I guess you don\u2019t know, because of the competition.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I think our seasonal plans on broth are just hitting the market now or has hit the market, so we expect to obviously be more competitive on broth and as well as on Prego, given the competitive situation.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Alexia Howard with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone.","Denise Morrison","Hi Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi There. Maybe I\u2019ll stick with the cost cutting question. After this $300 million is done, you have obviously got the underlying productivity improvements this quarter of 170 basis points. But does that mean that once the $300 million is done that\u2019s really be the end of the heavy or the big opportunity of cost cutting.","I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what this year you are overall EBIT growth is fairly modest even with all that costs coming out. Once that evaporates, what is the next level that\u2019s going to propel the earnings going from here? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. So, certainly we feel really good about where we are against the $300 million program, $215 million into it, $15 million left to go. So obviously we\u2019re very focused on delivering that. And if I step back, I will say that, it\u2019s never over, I mean cost savings are always going to be part of our long-term algorithm, we\u2019ve got our annual 3% of cost productivity program.","In addition to that as we finish this program, we are looking for additional opportunities, we don\u2019t have any news to share with you today, but again it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at. We will finish this program and then figure out where we go from there.","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Happy Thanksgiving.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thank you.","Denise Morrison","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John Baumgartner","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question.","Denise Morrison","Hi. Good morning.","John Baumgartner","Good morning. Denise, I would like to ask about the soup category in that overall volumes are still pretty weak after two years, I guess back in 2013 and 2014 when ready-to-serve came back to growth. So as you step back and look at the broader Simple Meals universe in which you compete.","How much has the competitive intensity increased more recently, whether it\u2019s from reformulations or innovation and what do you think gets the category back to at least flattish volumes on a sustainable basis?","Denise Morrison","I think in the recent past, what we experienced last year was some execution issues on our RTS soup. Condensed was largely stable and broth has been increasing nicely for several years. But we experienced declines on our Chunky brand that were quite severe due to a late labeling misstep.","We took a very robust price realization, which the good news is it is stuck, but we did do that and that cost us some volume. We thought that was really necessary for the price spectrum of soup from value to premium that we are providing now to the consumer and we didn\u2019t advertise Chunky. We literally did not have a consumer advertising campaign.","We have remedied that this year and that\u2019s why I believe that if we can continue to keep the stability on condensed soup, continue to grow broth and have a good comeback on RTS with Chunky and new Well Yes, I believe that is a stronger plan going forward.","John Baumgartner","So it sounds like over the past two years it\u2019s more self-inflicted as appose to anything from other Simple Meals categories then?","Denise Morrison","Well, we are the largest player in the category. So I believe, it\u2019s our responsibility to grow the category too.","John Baumgartner","Great. Thanks Denise.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Denise Morrison","Hi David.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning.","David Driscoll","So I wanted to ask about the gross margin a little bit more here in the expansion that we saw in margins in simple meals. Was there anything just like a continuation from last year or how sustainable is the margin expansion. And Anthony, we\u2019ve seen in the Q1 and Q2 that the company can have really large swings in margins depending on the timing of shipments and how you pace your soup production.","So I feel like there could be an answer in here related to plant efficiencies and things like that, that might inform us a little bit more and how gross margins will move throughout the next few quarters. It\u2019s a big question there, so can you peel that thing apart and give us a little help?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I mean, as you have seen the primary contribute to gross margin expansion came out of our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment and is driven by a couple of things. One is, our supply chain is just running really well and that is definitely sustainable. There is no reason that should fall back as we go throughout the year here.","There also added a gauge pretty well on productivity improvement, so let me give you a couple of examples, we recently expanded one of our warehouses at our major thermal plant, so we brought in some of the storage that was on third-party sites, so that saved us some money.","We\u2019ve added capacity and product lines like our Prego white sauce, additional capacity in a step to broth that we\u2019ve repatriated some co-pack volume on those two products and that obviously is sustainable. So I think the things that are generating the sales in the first quarter are definitely sustainable.","The sales that we see kind of moving against us, as we look ahead, one is on cost inflation. We are particularly within Americas benefiting from some deflation in the couple of key categories, things like still can and dairy, which I don\u2019t think is sustainable. And based on our forecast that\u2019s going to move from deflation to what I say is flattish in the back half.","And the third thing which I mentioned earlier, we are making investments in the cost line against our real food initiatives, the cost of removing artificial colors and ingredients cost associated with moving BPA from our can liners.","That\u2019s going to hit more as we progress throughout the year. So again, I think the supply chain is running well, and we\u2019ve got a couple of things that are going to turn a little bit as we go through the year.","David Driscoll","And then just a follow up on this. How does net price realization play into simple Meals. And then big picture, how does all these changes affects your quarterly EPS layout for the remaining portion of the year, noting that last quarter that you indicated that the year was going to be back half weighted?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. In this environment I think we\u2019ve talked this before were some categories that deflationary, and some categories are extremely competitive, we don\u2019t expect a lot of gains on net price realization this year. So that should be fairly stable throughout the year. In terms of front half and back half, I think we continue to see the majority of our growth coming in the back half compared to the first half.","David Driscoll","Thanks so much. Happy Thanks Giving.","Denise Morssion","Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Denise Morrison","Hi, David.","David Palmer","Thanks. And good morning. Hi Denise. From the measured channel data, it looks like your volume lift from two soups for specifically from promotions improved in the quarter. I'm remembering the labeling issue from last year, but perhaps there is more insight about the stronger performance from your soup promotions this year, and how we should look at that year-over-year lift from promotions going forward. Any color would be helpful. Thanks.","Anthony DiSilvestro","So, I can take crack of that. As we look back over the first quarter, its relatively early, and I think in terms of our promotional programs last year was the year which we saw significant change in some of our EBLP and our promoted price points.","This year it\u2019s going to be more stable, year-on-year on price points. And I think we\u2019re seeing the benefit of that, so mid quarter we started to put out our Chunky advertising programs. I think that more stable pricing environment enable these other things to kind of work together and to work well.","We\u2019ve got some new varieties on Chunky, we definitely have new and better advertising and we\u2019re spending more behind the brand. So I would say it\u2019s not that you can point to one thing on Chunky. I think it\u2019s all those demand drivers working together that are enabling us to see better performance on Chunky.","Denise Morrison","Yes. I also add that the launch of Well Yes although it\u2019s mid-year will be big and it\u2019s hitting and shipping during that key January wellness month from a consumer standpoint. So we expect that the promotional and merchandizing support on that brand will be great.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with CLSA. Your line is open.","Michael Lavery","Good morning.","Denise Morrison","Hi Michael.","Michael Lavery","I was wondering, if you could just touch on your [Kjeldsen] (Ph) business in China. I know you had reconfigured some of your distribution there. How is that progressing and specifically with say Golden Week or Single\u2019s Day have you seen better execution and performance?","Denise Morrison","Sure. We are expanding Kjeldsen in China. Last year, we made a distribution change and went from a distributor that we literally inherited when we bought the business to a different distribution network. That has actually worked out very well.","The litmus test was the Autumn Festival where we increased consumption and gained share in an expanded footprint. And we\u2019re going to continue to work that but we believe that that bodes well for Chinese New Year, which is really the big event for Kjeldsen. The first quarter is not usually a large quarter for us on that business, but second quarter is.","Michael Lavery","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly a housekeeping item on the tax rate. Any change we should be aware of? I mean is there an impact on the rest of the year from the change to the stock-based compensation? How should we think about that full year tax rate?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. So there has been a couple of puts and takes, but we continue to estimate that our full year rate to be around 32%, which is where that forecast has been.","Michael Lavery","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Sure.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.","Denise Morrison","Hey Jonathan.","Jonathan Feeney","Hi. How are you doing? Happy Thanksgiving.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi Jon.","Jonathan Feeney","So I was listening to some of these questions about competitive landscape and it seems to me like your biggest competitor only wanted to speak of in ready-to-serve soup as not only communicated to the world but it\u2019s now a foundation brand, not a growth brand for them. But has announced they are closing the original facility that\u2019s the headquarters to that and the largest single place.","So I guess as you look at your manufacturing centers, so if you look at ready-to-serve going forward, it would strike me the big risk here is only really lose these shelf space with the retailers because I mean there must be some pretty good momentum in Chunky as you are presumably putting more resources behind this.","And my questions would be are retailers recognizing the difference? Are they aware of this change in relative sort of commitment to this category? I know you have gotten that price realization there and what sort of expectations do you have over the next year, but the next couple of years as capacity changes in that industry that you will be able to hold share, or ready-to-serve as a whole as you presumably play a bigger role in that. Thanks very much.","Denise Morrison","We are committed to helping our retail customers grow their business and the center-store needs more innovation. To that point, we are increasing our investment in RTS Soup this year, again on Chunky with a flow Cold-Pressed and full integrated marketing campaign as well as the Well Yes introduction.","And I just believe in this environment that brings news to the center-store, retailers have also expressed real positive feedback on our stackable cans, it doesn\u2019t sound that big, but it is big to them because it enables them to merchandize and with operations efficiency and effectiveness. So I believe it will be a good season for RTS.","Jonathan Feeney","Okay. Thanks very much.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks Jonathan.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A session.

As a reminder this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to your host, Ken Gosnell. Please go ahead.","Ken Gosnell ","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake MacMinn, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. ","As usual we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. The call is open to the media who participate in a listen-only mode.","Today, we'll make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risks. Please refer to our slide two or our SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements.","Now I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release in the fourth quarter the company incurred charges associated with its initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategies to reduce cost and to streamline organizational structure. The company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $93 million related to the program and pretax charges of $13 million and administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. ","The aggregate after tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation cost was $0.21 per share. Last year, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded $21 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring related cost. We also recorded an additional $4 million of pretax settlement charges associated with the U.S. Pension plan. The aggregate after tax impact of these items was $0.06 per share. ","Also as a reminder fiscal 2015 included 53 weeks, with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter. The extra week was worth an estimated $129 million in net sales, $37 million in EBIT and $0.08 in EPS. The adjusted results exclude the impact of the additional week in the prior year. Our comparisons of the full year 2015 with 2014 will exclude previously announced items. Because we use non-GAAP measures we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which is included in our appendix. ","Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2016 earnings dates. We plan to release first quarter earnings on November 24 which will include the new segments and pension and post-retirement benefit accounting changes with the re-casted prior year Q1 data. Shortly after we release our 10-Q, we will release the remaining re-casted financials. The next three earnings dates are February 25, May 20 and September 1, 2016. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Denise. ","Denise M. Morrison","Thank you Ken and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. This morning I will offer my perspective on our performance, provide a progress report on several major strategic actions we initiated in 2015, including our redesigned enterprise structure and cost savings effort and share my outlook and areas of focus for fiscal 2016. ","At our Investor Day in July, I described how the food industry is in a period of revolutionary change, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Campbell. The changes in the industry are being driven by several seismic shifts; new global economic realities in the U.S. and abroad; major demographic changes and the redefinition of the American family; profound changes in consumer preferences for food, with greater focus on health and wellbeing, and the impact of digital technologies on marketing, shopping and the growing demand for greater transparency about food. ","The convergence and acceleration of these shifts are reshaping the consumer and retailer landscape. Combined with the prevailing industry dynamics of consolidation and cost cutting these shifts are placing increased pressure on traditional center store categories and mainstream food companies. ","With this as context, I'll focus my remarks this morning on our performance for fiscal 2015, review the important strategic actions we initiated during the year and highlight our key drivers for fiscal 2016. First I'll briefly comment on our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased that we finished fiscal 2015 inline with our revised expectations. Sales in the fourth quarter reflected the tough consumer operating environment with organic sales increasing 1%. Three of our five segments grew organic sales in the quarter. ","More importantly, we made significant progress in our internal actions to address our supply chain issues related to shipping capacity and customer service. We've also made substantial strides to improve our cost structure through our cost savings initiatives and enterprise redesign. We've reported the largest gross margin improvement in more than six years. Adjusted EBIT and earnings per share increased 5% in the fourth quarter. ","I was particularly pleased with the fourth quarter organic sales and earnings performance in U.S. Simple Meals as well as organic sales growth in Bolthouse and Foodservice. In the quarter we also completed the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, a fresh salsa and hummus business that will provide a platform for our further expansion in the Deli section. ","Turning to our full year results; with the solid finish we delivered sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS consistent with our most recent guidance. Organic sales increased 1% with growth in four of our five reporting segments. Adjusted EBIT was down 2% for the year and adjusted gross margin declined 70 basis points for the year, within the range that we had expected.","As I look at the year I'm pleased that our management team responded to our first half cost and margin challenges in a difficult operating environment. I am particularly encouraged with the improvement in gross margin we delivered in the back half and the fact that we posted organic sales growth in four of our five reporting segments. However we recognize that we have more work to do.","Before Anthony provides you with a detailed review of our results I will offer my perspective on several notable items, focusing on the full year. Looking at the year within U.S. Simple Meals the performance of our sauce business was a standout; notably Prego and Campbell\u2019s dinner sauces. Prego had another strong year behind the success of our white sauces and overall product superiority. Sales of Campbell dinner sauces increased double-digits for the year. Our strategically important Plum business drove double-digit sales growth with new products and continued distribution gains especially in the grocery channel.","In U.S. soup consumer takeaway was relatively stable and we posted positive share performance. For the year our Global Baking and Snacking segment performed well. Organic sales increased 3% and operating earnings were up 5%. I feel particularly good about the improvement in Australian biscuits as the team made significant progress in this important core business.","In Southeast Asia our Indonesia business delivered another year of double-digit growth but sales declined in the fourth quarter as a result of worsening economic conditions in this market, which we expect to persist. We had another year of decline in shelf-stable U.S. beverages. While the category remains challenged the underlining trends of our business are beginning to show signs of improvement. Consumer takeaway and share increased in the fourth quarter. Modest sales declines in V8 Red Juice were more than offset by the introduction of V8 Veggie Blends. Trial and repeat of Veggie Blends continued to meet expectations and depths of repeats remain strong. We expect our new advertising campaign to drive additional trial. ","V8 Splash our powerhouse brand for kids and V8 Plus Energy continue to perform well. In our immediate consumption channel we are beginning to see some momentum. We feel good about the overall direction of this business but we still face challenges, particularly with the continued decline of our V-Fusion franchise. In fiscal 2016 the entire category will remain under significant pressure. While we expect our U.S. Beverage businesses to improve we are not planning on a return to growth.","Let\u2019s now turn to the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment. As a reminder Bolthouse Farms consists of the farms and CPG businesses. Farms includes our retail fresh carrots business and our ingredients business, mainly carrot concentrate. CPG consists of our super premium beverages, ultra-premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings. We continue to be enthusiastic about Bolthouse Farms, especially the branded CPG business. For the year CPG sales increased high single-digits. Gains were driven by product innovation, increased distribution for beverages and incremental shelf-space at existing customers for our salad dressings.","The initial rollout of our cold pressed organic ultra-premium beverage line 1915 by Bolthouse Farms is off to a good start. After completing the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in June we have begun integrating the business. Thus far there have been no surprises and we are pleased with the retailer response to our long-term plans.","Fiscal 2015 was an eventful year and we took important steps to lay the foundation for the future. We redesigned our enterprise structure and our three new divisions are now operating in line with their declared portfolio roles. We established our integrated global services organization and moved elements of finance, procurement, marketing, sales, HR and IT into the shared service group. It's early days but we're off to a solid start. ","The focus in fiscal 2016 will be working smarter, creating efficiencies and reducing costs, while starting to build new enterprise capabilities within this group. We initiated plans for zero-based budgeting process. We're piloting ZBB in two cost categories in fiscal 2016 with plans to expand in the future. We believe this discipline will be of great value to Campbell going forward. ","We're off to a very good start to realizing our $250 million cost savings target. We delivered earlier than expected savings of approximately $85 million across several categories, including headcount reductions, non-working marketing, reduced travel expenses and spending on consultants. We added another growth engine with the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh portfolio and extend our presence in the perimeter beyond produce into the deli section. We initiated an important project to increase consumer trust by providing greater access to information about the ingredients we use and how we make our food. This is accelerating, meaningful changes to our recipes. For instance, overtime we're planning to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from nearly all of our North American products. ","Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we plan to deliver moderate growth in what we believe will continue to be a consumer environment marked by caution. As we outlined at our Investor Day in July, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we'll change our reporting segments reflecting our three new divisions, each with a distinct portfolio role. In our America Simple Meals and Beverages division we will focus on driving moderate growth while expanding our margins. We'll deliver this by focusing on fewer bigger initiatives that will attract new consumers while driving additional consumption by our loyal core consumers. ","For example, our Campbell's fresh fruit soups in K Cups will provide a new convenient way for consumers to enjoy soup. This represents an incremental eating occasion that taps into the growing frequency of smaller meals and snacks. Additionally, we'll take an industry leadership role by increasing our transparency efforts. We'll provide greater access to information about more of our North American product on the whatsinmyfood.com website. We also plan to improve more of our recipes consistent with our purpose. ","In global biscuits and snacks we're focused on expanding in developed and developing markets while improving our margins. In the developed markets of the United States and Australia, we're concentrating on restoring improved levels of growth. In the U.S., we'll apply a disciplined focus to consumer driven innovation, increased marketing behind our Goldfish and Milano brands and fuel growth in our fresh bakery portfolio. ","In Australia, we'll continue to improve our core Shapes products and drive Tim Tam's momentum, while shifting our marketing mix towards digital. We'll also remain focused on faster growing spaces, building on markets where we have a foothold such as Indonesia and China. We\u2019ll monitor and adjust to the economic conditions in both of these countries throughout the year. We recognize that there may be short-term economic pressure in these markets. In the long-term we believe that it is essential to become more geographically diverse with a higher percentage of our business in faster growing developing markets with an expanding middle-class. ","In the Campbell Fresh division we'll make focused investments to accelerate sales growth and expand into new categories. As we outlined at Investor Day our priorities are to build on the successful launch of our ultra-premium offering 1915. The product is in 2,000 stores today and we expect to expand to 8,000 stores during the first quarter. We will continue to accelerate our refrigerated salad dressing business through innovation and increased distribution. And finally we will integrate the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our existing refrigerated soup business into the Bolthouse Farms' fresh platform and significantly expand our market penetration. We expect our sea fresh business to become a full force growth engine for Campbell.","Across all of our businesses we\u2019ll continue to actively explore external development opportunities that make both strategic and economic sense. We will also remain focused on transforming our cost structure and culture. We are off to a promising start with our cost reduction efforts but we must remain diligent and continue to create an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own.","In closing, I am cautious but optimistic about fiscal 2016. I believe that the strategic imperatives we are pursuing, purpose and transparency in our core business, digital marketing and ecommerce, health and wellbeing and expansion in developing markets, coupled with our divisions' clear portfolio roles position us well for the year ahead. We\u2019re very clear eyed about our challenges, particularly driving sustainable sales growth, but we\u2019re now better organized and better prepared to meet those challenges head on.","We believe that our strategy to focus on driving growth, aggressively reducing cost and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the areas of our business with the greatest growth potential is the best way to create shareholder value. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Thanks Denise and good morning. Before reviewing our results and guidance I wanted to give you my perspective on our performance and future outlook. We finished the year with a solid quarter. I am very pleased with our gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, which improved by 180 basis points, benefiting from our price realization and productivity efforts. The improved gross margin and earlier than expected cost reductions drove 5% gains in both adjusted EBIT and the EPS for the quarter, despite a two point negative impact from currency translation. We made very good progress against our three year $215 million cost savings target, delivering about $85 million of savings in fiscal 2015.","For the full year we delivered results within our recent guidance ranges with EPS of $2.46 at the top end of the range. Looking ahead to 2016 our guidance, when you exclude the impact of currency translation and the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition is within our new long-term targets.","Now I will review our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter net sales on an as-reported basis declined 9% to $1.7 billion, primarily due to the impact of one less week and the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding those factors and our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet organic net sales increased 1% in the quarter as we benefited from higher selling prices. Adjusted EBIT increased 5% to $234 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partly offset by higher incentive compensation expenses and a two point negative impact from currency translation. Adjusted EPS also increased by 5% to $0.43.","For the full year reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales gaining 1% led by the strong performance of our Global Baking and Snacking segment. Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $1.2 billion, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage, a two point negative impact from currency translation and higher incentive compensation expense partly offset by volume gains and the benefit of our cost savings initiatives. The decline in gross margin down 70 basis points was driven by higher than anticipated cost inflation and the supply chain issues we experienced in the first half, partly offset by productivity and pricing gains. EPS of $2.46 was comparable to the prior year.","Decomposing our sales performance for the quarter as-reported sales declined 9%, with organic sales increasing by 1%. Volume and mix affected one point which was primarily in our Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Beverages segments. Higher selling prices across four of our reportable segments added one point to sales. Reduced promotional spending contributed one point to sales growth primarily driven by the Global Baking and Snacking segment. ","Currency translation had an adverse impact of three points. Our two primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar both continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar. Our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet added one point to sales and the impact of one less week subtracted seven points. ","Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 180 points to 36.1%. For the quarter, and moderating relative to earlier quarters, inflation increased by approximately 2%. Inflation and other factors had a negative impact on gross margin of 1.1 points. Mix had a negative impact of 40 basis points. In aggregate, our price realization actions have contributed 1.2 points of margin expansion with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm and 80 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily on condensed soups, Prego and in Canada. ","Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter, and overall on operating efficiencies we're above prior year levels. ","Marketing and selling expenses declined by 7% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of currency and reductions in selling expense and non-working marketing, both benefiting from our cost management efforts partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense. Adjusted administrative expenses increased 10% driven by higher incentive compensation costs compared to the prior year in which the expense was significantly below targeted levels. ","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS increased $0.02 compared with the prior year increasing from $0.41 to $0.43 per share. On a currency neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed $0.04 to EPS. Net interest expense declined $3 million, about a penny per share primarily due to the impact of one less week. ","With $200 million of share repurchases throughout the year under our strategic share repurchase program, this has reduced our share count and added a penny to EPS in the quarter. Going the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.8% up 80 basis points versus the prior year reflecting a shift in the mix between U.S. and foreign earning and negatively impacting EPS by $0.01. Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter completing the bridge to $0.43. ","Now turning to our segment results, in global baking and snacking our largest sales segment in the quarter. organic sales increased 1% as growth in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott\u2019s were partly offset by a decline in Kjeldsens. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by Fresh Bakery, Goldfish Crackers and frozen products partly offset by a decline in cookies. Organic growth in Arnott\u2019s reflected gains in Australia, partly offset by a decline in Indonesia. ","Operating earnings declined 26%, driven by the impact of one less week, higher marketing and administrative expenses, principally incentive compensation, currency translation and impairment charges to minor trademarks, partly offset by gross margin expansion. Excluding the impact of one less week, currency translation and the impairment charges, operating profit increased in the quarter. ","In U.S. Simple Meals, organic sales increased 4% while dollar consumption of soups in measured channels increased 1%. Movements in retail inventory levels contributed to sales gains in the quarter. As you may recall, movements in retail inventory levels had a negative impact on third quarter sales and we're experiencing the opposite effect in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with retail inventory levels comparable to the prior year. Organic sales in other Simple Meals increased driven by the continued strong growth of Prego pasta sauce. Segment sales also benefited from higher selling prices in condensed soups and Prego pasta sauce. Operating earnings increased 4% reflecting organic sales growth, productivity improvements and benefits from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by cost inflation and the impact of one less week. ","In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment organic sales increased 4%, with growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressing and North America Foodservice partly offset by declines in Bolthouse Farms carrots.","Operating earnings fell 3% on higher administrative expenses and the impact of one less week. U.S. beverage organic sales fell 4% primarily due to volume losses in V8 V-Fusion. While consumer takeaway dollar sales in measured channels was positive, sales were negatively impacted by reductions in retail inventory levels and sale declines in the club channels.","Operating earnings declined 23% due to the sales declines, including the impact of one less week. International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 5% from weakness in Canada and Australia. Operating earnings declined $10 million or 48% primarily due to volume declines, including the impact of one less week and currency translation.","This chart shows the as-reported sales performance of U.S. Soup, unadjusted for the impact of one less week which subtracted seven points in the quarter and one point for the full year. For the quarter U.S. Soup sales declined 2% with condensed down 4%, ready-to-serve down 3%, and broth up 11%. Excluding the impact of one less week sales of condensed soups increased with gains in both eating and cooking varieties driven by net price realization.","Sales of ready-to-serve soup also increased excluding the impact of one less week, primarily driven by the launches of our Fresh-Brewed Soup [indiscernible] and our line of organic soups. The double-digit sales gain on Swanson broth was primarily led by aseptic varieties. For the fiscal year, as shown towards the bottom of the chart soup sales declined 3% the prior year, as a 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve were partly offset by 3% growth in broth. ","Here\u2019s the U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending August 2, 2015, the category as a whole declined 0.9%. Our sales in measured channels declined 0.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups partly offset by gains in broth. ","Our share increased 10 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has now been relatively stable for three years. Other branded players in aggregate had a share of 28.1%, declining 30 basis points, while private label with a 12.6% share gained 20 basis points. ","We had strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2015. Cash from operations increased by $283 million to almost $1.2 billion driven by lower working capital requirements; lapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business, and lower pension contributions. ","Capital expenditures increased to $380 million as we increase capacity in Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms beverages, broth in North America and biscuits in Indonesia. We paid dividends totaling $394 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share.","In aggregate we repurchased 244 million of shares in fiscal 2015, 200 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt increased by approximately $60 million to $3.8 billion as gains in cash flows were more than offset by the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. ","Now, I'll review our fiscal 2016 guidance. The company expects to grow sales by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 3% to 5%, and adjusted EPS to grow by 3% to 5% or $2.53 to $2.58 per share. This guidance includes the estimated native impact of currency translation of two points across sales, EBIT and EPS. This guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition which is estimated to contribute one point of sales and EBIT growth. The acquisition is neutral at EPS including the impact of reducing our anticipated share repurchases to repay the acquisition debt. Excluding the impacts from currency headwinds and the acquisition, these growth rates are within our long-term growth targets of 1% to 2% organic sales, 4% to 6% for adjusted EBIT and 5% to 7% for adjusted EPS.","While we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect some sales headwinds in the first quarter given we're cycling a strong first quarter from last year and from timing related to our promotional strategies. As announced this morning, we intend to adopt mark-to-market pension and post-retirement benefit accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and recast our historical results. This change eliminates the deferral and subsequent amortization of historic actuarial gains and losses which will be recognized as incurred. ","The periodic mark-to-market adjustments will be reflected as an item impacting comparability and therefore excluded from adjusted results. We believe this accounting change will improve the transparency of our results and the year-to-year comparability. The 2016 guidance does not reflect the impact of the anticipated accounting change. However, 2016 growth rates are not expected to change from the re-casted 2015 base. ","As we operationalize our new division structure beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we will move from our current five reporting segments to three, America's Simple meals and Beverages, Global Biscuit and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. Historical results, reflecting both the new segments and change in accounting will be provided shortly after we file our first quarter 10-Q. ","Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance; we expect inflation in cost of product sold of approximately 2% to 3%, including the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses. Cost inflation will be offset by gains from our ongoing productivity program, which excluding our ZBB initiatives is targeted at 3% of cost of product sold. We expect our gross margin percentage to improve modestly as we continue to achieve net price realizations and improve our supply chain performance. We are accruing incentive compensation below the target levels in 2015 and anticipate a headwind of approximately $0.04 per share in 2016. The effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 31% to 32% compared to the 2015 adjusted rate of 31%. This guidance assumes about $0.02 per share incremental contribution from share repurchases which are expected to be at levels below fiscal 2015. ","We are forecasting capital expenditures to decline by $30 million to approximately $350 million, which is more inline with our historical spending levels. ","In fiscal 2015, we launched the comprehensive reorganization and a three year cost reduction initiative leveraging a zero-based budgeting approach and targeting annual savings of $250 million. As shown in the chart, we have achieved about $85 million of savings in 2015 as we've reduced headcount and realized savings across several cost categories. For 2016, we are targeting to increase the savings run rate to $145 million which will put us more than halfway toward $250 million goal. ","Most of the 2016 gains will come in the selling and marketing and administrative expense lines. The majority of the more complex supply chain gains will come later in the program. To implement the program we estimate total program cost in the range of $250 million to $325 million. In fiscal 2015 we recognized costs totaling $124 million, which includes $22 million of implementation costs and $102 million of restructuring charges principally severance as we implemented both a voluntary incentive separation program and headcount reductions as we've streamlined our organization. Against this program we estimate program costs of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2016. ","That concludes my remarks. I now turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time out of fairness to other callers if you could please ask only one question at a time. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open.","Robert B. Moskow","Hi, thank you. The gross margin expansion obviously was much higher than what we all expected, and I don\u2019t know, have you given any specific guidance for what kind of expansion you expect in fiscal \u201816? And also was there any help in the quarter resulting from kind of like the mismatch of incremental costs that you took on in first and second quarter, Anthony? I remember there were some noise there related to some inefficiencies for extra cost that needed to be spread out over multiple quarters. Did that influence the fourth quarter expansion at all?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","So Rob, I will comment on the fourth quarter and then I will come back to 2016. The fourth quarter comp is fairly clean. The only thing that gave us some advantage this year relative to last year is the timing of the mark-to-market adjustment on our commodity hedges. So we had a little bit of favorability this year relative to last year. So a small portion of that 180 basis points is that, and the rest is improvement in the operating performance of the business. ","In terms of 2016, as I said in my remarks, we expect to see a modest improvement in our gross margin percentage and I think the way to think about it there is a number of positives and a number of negatives. On the positive side our annual cost productivity program where we target 3% of cost, obviously that\u2019s the most significant benefit. We expect to see continued benefit on net price realization, mostly from the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken in the back half of this year. We do expect to see some margin improvement from improved supply chain performance year-on-year, given the challenges that we have in the first half of last year. ","On the negative side, three things to mention. One is cost inflation which we expect to be about 2% to 3% and that includes the negative impact of currency on the input cost of a number of our international businesses, but also includes some negative mix and lastly the cost of some quality improvements we are making in some of our -- both our products and packaging.","Robert B. Moskow","Okay, I\u2019ll let it go, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John J. Baumgartner","Thanks good morning. Denise wanted to ask about Global Baking and Snacking and the volume pressure there. Maybe if you could address in a bit more detail some of that pressure in Asia, particularly I guess Kjeldsens in China. And then in the U.S. cookie business and the softness here, it seems that Pepperidge pricing really began to outpace the category over the past few months. Are you seeing some elasticity impact there and how are you seeing that for fiscal \u201816?","Denise M. Morrison","Yeah, let me start first with our core business in the United States and in Australia we are pleased with the share in consumption of Goldfish crackers and in particular Milano, although we did experience in the quarter some softness in cookies. That was pretty much as expected, because we -- in the biscuit business in the United States, particularly in the quarter, we did not promote as heavily as last year because the promotions were not as productive as we would have expected. So that was pretty deliberate. But we expect moderate growth in the United States on our biscuit business. ","In the Australian business we are really happy with the year that we had there. That has been a pretty remarkable turnaround. We were challenged in Australia for a couple of years and they have now posted really outstanding results and it\u2019s been really on the fundamentals, better advertising, more innovation, more brand building, more digital. So we believe that the building blocks they put in place there are very sustainable. ","We had a great year in Indonesia with double-digit growth but we did have a slow fourth quarter and all you have to do is pick up a newspaper to see what\u2019s going on in Asia these days. But we\u2019re watching that very careful and we believe -- look we have lot of runway in Indonesia to expand our distribution points but we are going to be very responsible about that business in '16. ","And then the Kjeldsens business, this is a very small quarter for Kjeldsens. The sales are skewed in China largely towards Chinese New Year. But that said, we did have some inventory overhang from Chinese New Year this year and we're working through that right now. And that hit us predominantly in the fourth quarter. ","John J. Baumgartner","Perfect, thank you Denise. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open. ","Chris Growe ","Hi thank you. Good morning. ","Denise M. Morrison","Hi Chris. ","Chris Growe","Hi, just a quick question if I could then. I just wanted a sense of the degree of promotional spending and what you expected to do across the year. I know every business is different and I'm sure broadly you have expectations for each business. But is there an overall outcome [ph] that's going to come from promotional spending may be related to that advertising, not sure I heard that, what you expect advertising spending for the year? Thank you. ","Denise M. Morrison","Yeah, we are continuing to manage our trade promotions to maximize our profitable volume. We're maintaining a focus on competitive activity in both our customer programs and in our consumer response. And we are, as noted, looking for opportunities to improve our trade spending not only for ourselves to get a better return but also for our customers to get a better return. And so there is no real strategy to cut back but they're definitely is improved analytics and revenue management. So we have a much more productive trade spend. ","In total, our advertising consumer and trade was about 24% of sales which we try and aim for about 24% to 25% as a rule. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. ","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Good morning ","Jason English","First a quick housekeeping question. Can you guys quantifying what the 2015 EPS base is going to look like post the re-casting related to pension accounting?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Sure I can do that. I think the way to think about it in 2015, the amortization within our pension expense is going to be about $100 million pretax. And that's a good proxy for the impact of the accounting change when we through a bunch of pluses and minuses. I think a couple of additional points on this, these plans have been close to new hires for a couple of years now. They're very well-funded. We ended the year at 97% to 98% in terms of funded status. And we don't expect to make any contributions to our U.S. plans in 2016. ","Jason English","Thank you. That's helpful. And you mentioned ZBB focused on two cost categories. Can you specify what categories those are?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Yeah, we did our pilot program on our non-working marketing and also on the consulting. ","Jason English","And on marketing, it's -- you're focusing on more productivity there? It's down around 17% from your fiscal '10 high. How much further can you go, and as you try to some of balance and walk the line of containing promotions and I think it's encouraging to see that promotions actually being a positive contributor to sales, can you do both at the same time. Can you continue to hold the line of marketing and find efficiencies there, while at the same time pulling back or find the efficiencies on trade spend? Or is it a either\/or type situation as you think about the forward? ","Denise M. Morrison","I think that we look at the marketing mix as the three elements of advertising consumer and trade. And of course that mix is going to vary by business in terms of what degree we spend. But we do have some shifts going on. As Anthony alluded to we are making a conscious effort to reduce our non-working marketing where it's not a productive spend. ","The second is within advertising, we are shifting more dollars out of conventional TV and more into digital. And that spend has been shifting overtime but will be up to 40% going forward. And then we try again for ACT to stay in the range of about 24% to 25% of sales and that's remained pretty constant over the last couple of years. ","Jason English","Thank you very much. I appreciate the color and I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC. Your line is open. ","Denise M. Morrison","Hi David. ","Operator","David, if your line is on mute can you please unmute it? We'll move onto our next question. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Denise M. Morrison","Hey, Ken.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning. Real quick one, regarding U.S. Simple Meals, and forgive me if you mentioned this, but you talked about positive movements in the retailer inventory levels. Can you elaborate a bit on how much that helped and what happened that your customers, I guess loaded up a bit on purchases versus the prior year?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Yeah, I think it's more about how we came into the quarter. If you recall the third quarter I think our sales were down 10% while our consumption was only down one. So we came into the quarter with inventory levels down. We ended the quarter and the year with retail inventories about where they were a year ago. So in the fourth quarter while our consumption was plus 1%, our organic sales were plus about 5%. So we had about four points of lift from that shift in inventory.","Ken Goldman","Thanks and a quick one if I can, in terms of U.S. cookies your two main competitors have made some DSD investments there. Can you talk about whether you think those investment have affected your business at all negatively, and whether you might want to add to your capability there to match what some of your peers have done? ","Denise M. Morrison","I can't comment really on competition investments. But I can say that we continue to be very supportive of our independent distributor network. They are a large part of our business model and we'll continue to build the business alongside of them.","Ken Goldman","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew C. Grainger ","Hi, good morning everyone.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Hi, Matt.","Denise M. Morrison","Good morning.","Matthew C. Grainger ","Denise, I just wanted to touch on the -- come back to the outlook for U.S. beverages in 2016, it sounds like you are still cautious, definitely from a sales perspective. But is it possible that we could begin to see some improvement in margin or profit growth? And as you think about the growth profile of that business, given how persistent volume declines have been, do you think there may be an opportunity to perhaps take a more profit maximizing approach, perhaps focus a little bit more on pricing realization?","Denise M. Morrison","We are doing both and obviously the category itself has been under a lot of pressure based on the consumer and so what we've been really focused on is how do we broaden our line and better deliver on the things that consumers are looking for in vegetable juices and we believe that vegetable juices have an advantage based on the consumer trends. We learned a lot from Bolthouse and actually our V8 veggie blends reflect a broadening of vegetable based beverages based on consumer preferences for those particular flavor profiles and we think that that is really taking the business in the right direction. ","That said we still have some leaky bucket in our V8 V-Fusion that we're dealing with. Our V8 SPLASH and V8 Plus Energy are doing really well and our immediate consumption has now posted the second quarter of growth. So we've got some good signs on the growth curve, but more things working than not. But we're still are cautious about declaring victory yet. ","The other thing we're working on is a mastering complexity project in our supply chain which we believe will have a really positive impact on our profit going forward. But that is a longer term play.","Matthew C. Grainger ","Okay, thanks and then just to come back to some of the more on trend new products like V8 Veggie blends. Is that something, maybe not initially but something that you feel can be rolled out in a more of a margin neutral way given sort of the added quality components of it?","Denise M. Morrison","The brand -- Veggie Blends is showing some really good trial and repeat, and we believe we do have to invest marketing to drive the trial because the repeats are so strong. Building a new product today is heavy lifting and so making sure that we breakthrough and we are supporting the brands we put out there is an important idea.","Matthew C. Grainger ","Sure. Okay, thanks Denise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan D. Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone.","Denise M. Morrison","Hello, Bryan.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Hey, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane","Just a quick question about just the cost inflation assumption for 2016, can you just give us some color around where the inflation pressure is, especially most more recently you\u2019ve seen some commodity movements that would presumably be more favorable and also just to what degree your inflation assumption for 2016 reflects some incremental cost related to the like ingredient changes?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Sure, I can you give you a little more color on that. So overall, like I said earlier the cost inflation of about 2% to 3%. If you parse that apart and look at the core ingredients and packaging and energy component it\u2019s about 1%. And within that the key drivers will be about five categories, vegetables, flavors, sweeteners, chocolates and we have a significant increase in -- as a result of the avian flu, in both eggs and pasta. In eggs we\u2019re looking at inflation rates of close to 50% in fiscal \u201916. So those are the key drivers of the 1%. Then on top of that there\u2019s a couple of other items. So first would be and I alluded to it, the FX impact of input cost on our Canadian business and the Australian business is fairly significant. ","And then the other couple of pieces, one would be wage raise within the supply chain and also benefits both healthcare and pension. And in terms of the commodities, because you mentioned some of the prices coming down, we're locked in to about 75% of our commodities for fiscal \u201916.","Bryan D. Spillane","Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful and have a great Labor Day Weekend everyone.","Denise M. Morrison","Thank you, you too. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Fini with Asos Research [ph]. Your line is open. ","Denise M. Morrison","Hi, Jon.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, how are you? Good morning. One question I had. I wanted to get more detail about the -- you mentioned retailer inventories particularly within Simple Meals. Any kind of detail you can give us about how sustainable those are, particularly in broth where sales are particularly strong, what kind of went on and maybe more detail by channel? I know you discussed it a little bit but are there any particular retailers who are moving inventories around in a way that affected profit this quarter? Thanks.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","No, other than the comment I made earlier that we came in to the quarter with inventory below last year. I mean it\u2019s kind of a rocky road. We started the year and ended the year about the same place, right which isn't a lot of retail inventories. The issue that we saw all throughout the year was the quarterly volatility starting with the first quarter with the timing of the holidays change because we had one less week in the fiscal year and then some timing in the third quarter where we pulled back quite a bit on some of our promotional activity in soup and that led to some reduction in retailer inventories. That corrected in the fourth quarter and I\u2019ll say again we ended the year at relatively low levels comparable to a year ago and I don't -- can't think of any particular anomaly within that Jonathan. ","Denise M. Morrison","The drivers are really that inventory movement is largely a function of promotional activity and as we\u2019re noting the activity is not consistent quarter-to-quarter and inventory changes are largely individual customer decisions. So those are three other points that round out that discussion. ","Unidentified Analyst","Great, well. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","Denise M. Morrison","Hi, David. ","David Driscoll ","Thank you. Good morning. Denise, I wanted to ask a little bit about this new segment America Simple Meals and Beverages, and just really to ask about the margin opportunity that\u2019s there for the segment, and I want to say something that I feel like that there\u2019s been almost a basic philosophical shift here, such that the focus moves from what I perceive in the past as just kind of a maniacal focus on volumes to a very different business focus for that segment, now just going for profit. So number one, am I right -- am I overstating kind of the philosophical shift and can you give us some dimensions on the margin opportunity, and I'm not too concerned about the timeline, this is not a fiscal \u201916 question, I really want to understand big picture where it\u2019s going?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, I think, expecting that business to grow moderately at the top line and expand margins is a more balanced approach to the portfolio in terms of expecting these categories to do what they can do. And that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t have pockets of growth. For example the Plum business resides in that category in to -- in that division. And we expect robust growth from Plum. We also are not taking our foot off the gas on innovation but we're being a lot more selective about the innovation we put into the market, because we're in a different place. And couple of years ago we didn't have a pipeline. ","And so what happened as a result are some little ideas got out into the marketplace. Today we have built the pipeline and we could be more choiceful about the larger ideas, where we know we're going to get an impact from. And so I think this is a much more responsible way to run this business. And we believe that we can deliver better value for our shareholders with this approach. ","David Driscoll ","But is there any way to kind of put a kind a guideline to this margin expansion. I mean I'm trying to get a sense of just is this 10-20 basis points a year or is this something that has a bigger potential than that?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","I would say let me put it at this way, I think there is an opportunity overtime to grow the profit in that division above the company target. ","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, and it has been eroded for the past couple of years. So by -- getting into our cost structure and getting into the discipline of zero-based budgeting we're going to be able to do this in a very surgical way, so that it sticks in a sustainable way. ","David Driscoll ","I really appreciate the comments. Thank you so much. ","Operator","Our final question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open. ","Denise M. Morrison","Hi Diane. ","Diane Geissler","Good morning.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Good morning.","Diane Geissler","I wanted to ask about the soup category. So we're heading into the start of the soup season here. It seems just anecdotally the category is a little promotional. I'm sure it's probably promotional every fall, because it is the high season. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on shelf and from the retailers in terms of the levels of support they're looking for? And is there any divergence from what you've seen around this time kind of every year?","Denise M. Morrison","It's early days in the season. Right now where we're focused on is making sure that our shelf space is intact and the products are merchandized correctly on shelf. We have new products that are being cut in like the K cups and organic soup, making sure that that's sufficiently placed. Our Campbell sales team is working with customers on a robust promotion schedule and not -- but pretty consistent with what we had in prior years. So at this point in time I don't see anything unusual. I don't know Anthony if you have anything to add?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","No, nothing. ","Diane Geissler","And the K cups, how will you account for those? Are those -- what do you consider those condensed or\u2026?","Denise M. Morrison","We actually believe they will be largely incremental to the category because it is an incremental usage occasion, going after soup as a snack. We believe that there is a great overlap between our Campbell soup users and Keurig users. And our research has confirmed that. We are shelving it in the coffee aisle, in about 70% of the retail environment. And that's basically because we believe that people who are interested in buying K cups will see this as a real positive in terms of expanding the usage of their dispensers into new categories and new usage occasions. ","We have two pack sizes, one designed to drive trial which we situating in the soup aisle and then the -- that\u2019s a two count pack, and then a six count pack in the coffee aisle. So we're pretty excited about it. It's going to be different, but we believe that the space has really been a game changer for coffee and we expect some good things from it. ","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","The segment classification is the good question. And I'd have to think about that and what we'll do when we get to the first quarter I'll make sure I highlight which segment we put that in.","Diane Geissler","Okay. And how many flavors are in the K cups?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","I think right now it's just two. ","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, two.","Diane Geissler","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","You're welcome. ","Operator","And that does conclude the Q&A session. I'll turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to your host, Ken Gosnell. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Gosnell - Vice President-Finance Strategy and Investor Relations","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the second quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2016. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake MacMinn, Senior Manager Investor Relations. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in a listen-only mode.","Today we'll make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide two or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.","With that, let me turn the call over now to Denise.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and our progress on the strategic changes we've implemented at Campbell over the past year. Overall, I'm pleased with our results this quarter, but not satisfied with our sales performance. We delivered outstanding adjusted EBIT and EPS growth. I'm particularly happy with our continued gross margin expansion, improved execution from our supply chain team, and the progress we've made on our cost savings initiative.","Organic sales for the quarter were comparable to a year ago, a bit below our expectations as our categories and geographies continue to face challenging conditions. As I discussed last week at CAGNY, the macroeconomic conditions are challenging in many of the markets where we have operations. In the United States, consumer spending remains cautious. In other parts of world, financial capitals are grappling with the weakening economies and increased volatility. We recognize that sales growth in many of our center-store categories has been a key challenge for Campbell. Driving profitable net sales growth remains an area of focus for our entire team.","Our supply chain execution continued to improve this quarter. We've now delivered four consecutive quarters of improved supply chain performance, dating back to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As we head into the second half of the year, we expect to sustain this performance. However, we'll begin cycling our improved operations and the rate of improvement will likely come at a more modest pace.","I'm also extremely pleased with the over-delivery of our three-year cost savings initiative. Through a combination of our organization redesign, the creation of our Integrated Global Services group, head count reductions, more stringent policies, and the implementation of zero-based budgeting, Campbell is becoming a leaner, more effective, and more efficient company.","In addition to lowering our cost base, we're seeing signs of cultural change, as employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. We're reaping the benefits of our cost savings efforts ahead of our expectations, and we continue to identify additional savings opportunities. As a result, we increased our 2018 savings target to $300 million, up from the $200 million objective we set when we introduced the program one year ago.","We'll continue to invest a portion of these savings into our businesses, based on their portfolio roles and longer-term growth opportunities that we've identified to create shareholder value over time. For instance, we plan to make several investments in the (4:45) second half of the year in the areas of new product development and support for several of our key brands. Additionally, we're building new capabilities in areas such as e-commerce.","As announced last week, we raised our annual earnings guidance and now expect adjusted EBIT to (5:08) 13% and adjusted EPS to grow by 9% to 12%. We continue to expect the outlook for net sales to be in the range of negative 1% to 0%.The improved outlook for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS are primarily due to improved gross margin performance and the better than expected benefits of our cost savings initiative.","Now I'd like to share my perspective on our segment results. Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth, consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. As we previously outlined, we're focused on increasing net price realization, including optimizing promotion spending and improving our supply chain performance. I'm encouraged by the progress we've made against all three of them.","Organic sales declined by 1% in the quarter, predominantly driven by a decline in U.S. soup sales. As context, the entire wet soup category declined 3% for the 13 weeks ended January 31. Our soup sales down 4% were below our expectations, although we had some bright spots. Our condensed soup business was up for the quarter and our broth business grew nicely. However, declines in ready-to-serve soup more than offset those gains.","Let me explain the factors at play. As we discussed back in the first quarter, we began taking steps to increase our net price realization through a combination of pricing actions and implementing more balanced promotion plans to support our business. As anticipated, these price realization activities had a negative impact on volume, but it was a necessary step to address the historical lack of price realization in RTS and strategically important for our entire soup portfolio.","Another factor was the timing of our marketing plans. As we discussed in the first quarter, our marketing and merchandising support was planned for later in the year across the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter. We also experienced some execution issues related to an on-label promotion on our Chunky brand.","Finally, weather is not something we control and it's certainly not the main reason for the decline in our soup business, but we believe the unusually warm winter had a negative impact on the entire category in the first half. In January, we grew soup sales in the high single-digits as we began to address our execution issues in Chunky, ramped up marketing activities, implemented more effective promotions, and benefited from more seasonal weather. Our plans will continue into the third quarter.","Despite these headwinds, we're taking steps to improve the performance of our U.S. soup business. Our pricing actions are taking hold. We've implemented more impactful promotion programs and our new advertising campaign is resonating with consumers. This bodes well for the future.","Beyond soup, our Simple Meals business performed well in the quarter with solid sales growth in Prego, Pace and especially Plum. We told you last July that our innovation plans in the Americas would focus on fewer, bigger ideas. In our quest to ramp up innovation, we recognize that some things will work and others will not. The key is to recognize it early and move on, and that's precisely what we're doing. Overall, our innovation results are mixed.","On the plus side, Campbell's dinner sauces platform and Slow Kettle soups continue to grow and are over-indexing with Millennials. Campbell's organic soup line is meeting expectations and helping us expand our health and well-being options in the center-store. In our Beverage business, we're pleased with V8 Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy. Finally, the innovation driving the expansion of our Plum portfolio is robust as this brand continues to build loyalty with Millennial parents.","Now, let's look at what's not working as well. Pace and Prego Ready Meals and Campbell's Fresh Brewed Soups in K-Cups are performing below expectations, and we're taking steps to evaluate the root cause and course correct. Additionally, we've discontinued the V8 Protein line. Our key learning was that these shakes and bars were not differentiated enough to succeed in a crowded and competitive space.","We recently hired Greg Shewchuk as our new Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer for the Americas division. With his expansive experience, we expect he will lead accelerated marketing innovation and sharpen our focus on fewer, bigger initiatives. We're excited to welcome Greg to the team in early March.","Clearly, the highlight in the Americas division was the significant gross margin expansion and the 22% increase in operating earnings. A major improvement this quarter was our supply chain performance. In addition to our ongoing productivity programs, we improved our execution in transportation and warehousing. We also benefited from the benign inflationary environment. Overall, our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division continues to make progress in delivering against its portfolio role.","Moving on, our Global Biscuits and Snacks division performed well in the quarter, delivering organic sales growth and driving significant profit. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen business, and its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets.","Our core developed markets of Australia and the United States continue to deliver positive results. I'm pleased with the performance in our U.S. biscuits and bakery business, with sales growth across numerous Pepperidge Farms categories, including fresh bakery, frozen, and cookies. Looking ahead, we have solid innovation plans in place in our core developed markets, with new products in the U.S., such as the launch of Artisan rolls and the introduction of Goldfish crackers with organic wheat. In Australia, we're re-staging our shapes product line to increase the flavor of these popular snacks.","Turning to developing markets, excluding the impact of currency, sales growth in Malaysia was offset by the declines in Indonesia, where economic conditions remain challenging. While we're expecting the Indonesian economy to improve in the second half of the year, we don't expect our business to return to growth this year.","In China, our primary focus has been the Kelsen business. We've made many changes to improve this business since acquiring it in August 2013. At the end of fiscal 2015, we changed distributors, added new marketing and digital talent, and began ramping up our sales force. We had a solid sell-in for the Chinese New Year, our biggest and most important season, and our new distributors delivered strong execution, including merchandising supported by our new integrated marketing campaign. As I discussed last week at CAGNY, we believe it's important for Campbell to become more geographically diverse, despite short-term volatility in developing markets.","Turning now to Campbell Fresh, C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new packaged fresh categories.","Reported segment sales increased 10% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales were comparable to a year ago. In Bolthouse Farms, we delivered mid-single digit sales growth in beverages and double digit gains in refrigerated salad dressings.","Carrot sales were down slightly, although we grew share. We continued to drive growth in the faster growing organic segment of the carrot market and we're taking steps to increase our presence there. As a reminder, one of the key roles of our market leading carrot business is to provide the refrigerated logistics system and scale in the perimeter that we can leverage for distribution and merchandising of our CPG business.","Our carrot ingredients business remains challenged with a significant decline in the quarter related to reduced export demand from Japan. As expected, the rate of decline moderated in the quarter and we expect that trend to continue in the back half of the year.","We're happy with the margin expansion in C-Fresh, and the increased operating profit. We've invested in capacity, enabling us to increase our in-house production. We rationalized unproductive beverage SKUs, we've increased our supply chain productivity, and we've managed SG&A. However, C-Fresh's portfolio role is full force growth and we expect stronger top line performance from the CPG portion of this business.","Looking ahead, we expect improved sales growth in C-Fresh in the second half of the year to be driven by stronger performance in the CPG business and moderating declines in carrot ingredients. We have one of the strongest spring innovation efforts in several years. We'll add 14 new items across beverages and salad dressings, including six new varieties of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our ultra-premium cold-pressed organic juice line.","With our increased capacity coming online this month, we expect to expand our ACV distribution of 1915 to 50% this year, largely in line with the category. The integration of Garden Fresh Gourmet and our retail perimeter soup business into C-Fresh is progressing well. Sales of retail soup were up modestly in the quarter and Garden Fresh Gourmet is tracking to deliver the sales we expected through increased distribution and increased market penetration.","We've accomplished a great deal over the last 12 months as we've aligned our enterprise structure with our strategy, created three new divisions with strong leadership, defined clear portfolio roles and implemented a major cost savings initiative. We're now better positioned to execute our strategies and to invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest growth potential, including several investments in the second half of this year.","Against this backdrop, I'm encouraged by our performance this quarter. Our enterprise redesign and cost savings efforts are delivering better than expected results and our new divisions are beginning to perform in line with their portfolio roles. But we remain unsatisfied with our top line growth and I know we can do better. We expect to improve our growth profile in the second half and we continue to stay focused on driving long-term sustainable profitable net sales growth.","I look forward to answering your questions, but now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the second quarter. At the top line, organic sales, which were comparable to last year, were below our expectations, reflecting the sales performance of U.S. soup. We made outstanding progress in gross margins, up 4 percentage points on an adjusted basis, benefiting from our price realization actions and supply chain performance.","Our cost savings initiatives are delivering significant benefits, $50 million in the second quarter, and as we shared at CAGNY last week, we've raised our three-year savings target to $300 million, with these savings impacting multiple P&L lines. Based on our gross margin performance and incremental cost savings, we also raised our full year earnings guidance last week, and I'll provide more detail in a moment.","Now I'll take you through the detailed results in our 2016 guidance. For the second quarter, net sales on an as reported basis declined 1% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks were offset by declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages.","Reflecting a four point increase in operating margin, adjusted EBIT increased 26% to $423 million, benefiting from a higher gross margin percentage and savings from our cost reduction initiatives. These positive drivers were partly offset by higher incentive compensation cost, currency translation, which had a 3 point negative impact and lower volumes. Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $0.87.","For the first half, net sales on an as reported basis were down 2%, while organic sales were comparable to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT increased 24% and adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 21%.","Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, reported sales declined 1% with organic sales comparable to the prior year. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by U.S. soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment. Higher selling prices contributed 1 point, while lower promotional spending also added a point, both driven by our net price realization efforts in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and in Global Biscuits and Snacks.","Currency translation had an adverse impact of 2 points on the top line, as our two primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, weakened against the U.S. dollar. To complete the bridge, the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet contributed 1 point to net sales in the quarter.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 4 points to 37.3%, exceeding our expectations on lower than an anticipated cost inflation and better than anticipated supply chain performance. Compared to the year-ago period, within inflation and other, we experienced improved supply chain performance, primarily from transportation cost savings initiatives as well as lower losses on open commodity contracts. In aggregate, inflation on input cost was close to zero. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 20 basis points. Our net price realization actions contributed 1.4 points of margin expansion, with 50 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in U.S. soup and Pepperidge Farm and 90 basis points from higher selling prices.","Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our three-year cost savings programs, contributed 180 basis points to margin improvement in the quarter. Recent capacity additions in Bolthouse Farms and U.S. broth, as well as our soup common platform initiative, are contributing to these productivity gains.","Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted marketing and selling expenses declined 5% in the quarter, primarily due to reductions in non-working marketing from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion expense, driven by increases in Kelsen, Pepperidge Farm and U.S. soup. Adjusted administrative expenses increased 6%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs compared to a year ago, partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiatives.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, in aggregate, adjusted EPS increased $0.16 compared with the prior year from $0.71 to $0.87 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT, mostly from the gross margin expansion and benefits from our cost savings initiatives, contributed $0.22 to EPS growth. The impact in share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but had no impact on EPS for the quarter. And while net interest expense increased $2 million, as we extended the maturity on the debt portfolio in fiscal 2015, this also had no impact on EPS for the quarter.","Going the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.6%, up 2.8 points versus the prior year, primarily due to lapping the favorable resolution of an inter-company pricing agreement, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.04. Currency had a $0.03 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.87 per share.","Now, turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 1% to $1.2 billion. U.S. soup sales decreased 4%, driven by declines in ready-to-serve soups, partly offset by gains in broth and condensed soup. Sales of other U.S. Simple Meals increased, driven by gains in Plum, Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces. Sales of U.S. Beverages declined, primarily due to weakness in V8 V-Fusion beverages.","Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales in Canada decreased, driven by declines in soup. Operating earnings increased 22%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization, productivity gains and improved supply chain performance.","Reflecting declines in ready-to-serve soups, total U.S. soup sales declined 4%, driven by category declines from warmer weather, the volume impact from our pricing actions, the timing of our marketing programs, and an issue with an on-label promotion on Chunky, which has since been corrected. Within U.S. soup, RTS declined 20%, which was partly offset by a 7% gain in Swanson broth and a 2% gain in condensed.","We began and ended the quarter with retailer inventory in aggregate comparable to year-ago levels. As we said last quarter, we do not believe subcategory sales performance is a meaningful disclosure. We will continue to provide it through the fiscal year before discontinuing in 2017.","Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending January 31, 2016, the category as a whole declined 1.9%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2.8%, with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 50 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, up 30 basis points, reflecting share gains by smaller brands.","In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2%, with growth in Pepperidge Farm and the Asia Pacific region. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by fresh bakery, frozen products and cookies. Sales of Goldfish crackers were up slightly for the quarter, with modest share gains for the first half of the fiscal year.","In the Asia Pacific region, excluding the impact of currency translation, growth in Australia, driven by Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, was partly offset by declines in Indonesia, as that market continues to face economic challenges. Operating earnings increased 23%, primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization and productivity gains, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation.","In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales were comparable to the prior year, with gains in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, which on a combined basis grew mid-single digits, offset by declines in carrot ingredient export sales and declines in retail carrots, despite gaining share. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment.","Operating earnings grew 62% to $21 million, driven by a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from improved supply chain performance, productivity improvements, and the favorable mix impact from growth in the higher margin refrigerated beverages. This performance resulted in a 2 point improvement in operating margin for the segment compared to a year ago.","We had strong cash flow performance in the first half. Cash from operations increased by $143 million to $727 million, driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements. Capital expenditures increased $10 million to $153 million. We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016.","We paid dividends totaling $197 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $86 million of shares in the first half, $50 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by approximately $150 million, as positive net cash flow generated by the business more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet.","Now, I'll review our 2016 guidance, which is consistent with our news release on February 16. We expect sales to change by minus 1% to 0%, including a 1 point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, and a 2 point negative impact from currency translation, as compared to the previous estimated currency impact of 3 points. This sales guidance implies a reduction in organic sales compared to our previous guidance, reflecting the performance of U.S. soup.","Benefiting from gross margin performance and incremental cost savings, we expect adjusted EBIT to grow by 10% to 13% and adjusted EPS to grow by 9% to 12%. Our full year guidance implies a modest earnings decline in the back half of the year. This reflects investments we are making in new product launches, higher marketing spending, and headwinds from higher incentive compensation and the negative impact of currency on the input costs of our international businesses.","We expect adjusted gross margin to expand by approximate 175 basis points, driven primarily by our first half performance. In the back half, we anticipate headwinds from increased promotional spending to support new products and key brands, the negative impact of currency on the input costs of our international businesses and from modest cost inflation.","Offsetting these headwinds, gross margin will benefit from our cost savings initiatives and productivity gains, but we will be wrapping much of the pricing and improved supply chain performance we experienced in the first half.","Against our cost savings program, we expect to deliver savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016, compared to our previous range of $80 million to $100 million. As announced last week, we have increased our 2018 annual savings target from $250 million to $300 million. Also, we expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 33%.","That concludes my remarks. And now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.","Kenneth Gosnell - Vice President-Finance Strategy and Investor Relations","Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time, out of fairness, if you would, to other callers, please ask only one question at a time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Denise, you talked about your desire to continue growing in emerging markets via M&A, and I think the phrase you used to describe the EM situation was, and correct me if I'm wrong, short-term volatility. I guess my question is how do we know? How are we confident that the issues are not permanent slowdowns over there? Because I'm trying to get a sense of Campbell's willingness maybe to spend on an asset in a geography less attractive than it once was versus your other M&A goal, which is faster growing domestic assets, right? I mean, some of these that have been sold lately, Vega I think is one of them, I would have thought Campbell might have been very interested in.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We expect that the emerging markets that we currently have footholds in, and that is China and in Southeast Asia, will continue to be viable markets for our business, particularly our Global Biscuits and Snacks business, which is growing, despite the fact that their overall growth rates are down, particularly in China. We do think that even though their growth rates have slowed, they're still growing faster than the domestic market. And we also know that 70% of the growth in the food industry is going to come from emerging markets over the next decade. So we believe we need to continue in a smart way to expand our geographic footprint. That said, we'll continue to look for smart M&A, both in emerging markets and also domestically in sync with our strategy.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a question if I could in relation to \u2013 you've got a heavy degree of cost savings coming through and really influencing your gross margin. I guess, maybe two questions related to that. One is do you have, and if I missed this, excuse me, but gross margin guidance for the year? Now it looks like that's running well ahead of your expectations. And then in relation to that, you talked about increasing your marketing investments in the second half of the year. I had planned for you to do that anyway. Are you stepping those up? Are we seeing the investment levels increase from what you had assumed initially for the year?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. So I'll take that one. I'll comment first on the gross margin comment. Yes, we are giving guidance on gross margin, and we expect 175 basis points of gross margin improvement for the year. So that implies about a flattish back half, but let me try to give you some more context on this one. I think if you go back to last fiscal year 2015, it really is a story of two halves. In the first half of last year, gross margin was down about 2 points, and in the second half of last year gross margin was up 1.4 points, as we took some pricing and improved our supply chain performance in the back half. So if you look at it on a two-year basis, both the first and second half of this year are each up just over a point versus two years ago. And the reason we're flat in the back half is a couple of things, there are a couple of headwinds. One is higher promotional spending to support some new product launches and some key brands and, as I mentioned in my comments, the negative impact of currency on costs. So both our Australian business and Canadian business have a significant portion of their inputs that are denominated in U.S. dollars. And we were hedged for a while, but we're closer to market now on those currency impacts. So that's having an increasing impact. And we still had a little bit of cost inflation, although it's more moderate than certainly we had initially expected. And we believe we'll be able to offset all of that impact with continuing productivity gains and the benefits of our cost savings program.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Chris, I'll take the second part of that question. As our cost savings have materialized earlier than expected, we are also accelerating our investments where it's prudent to do so. So it's very choiceful and it's across all three of our divisions. So in C-Fresh, we're going to be supporting our strongest innovation effort in several years with 14 new products, including six new varieties of 1915. In Global Baking and Snacking, we're investing in Goldfish with the launch of organic wheat Goldfish. We're investing in Tim Tam and the relaunch of Shapes in Australia. And then in the Americas, we still have marketing activity that, remember, we staged later in the year to support our soup and our beverage businesses, as well as product launches across Simple Meals and a robust pipeline for Plum Organics. So we have a lot of activity planned in the second half and this does reflect an acceleration.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Hey, I wanted to...","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. I wanted to ask about the declines in ready-to-serve. The first half of the year they were pretty steep, and it's been like that for a couple of years now. And I wanted to know, Denise, how are you going to balance the portfolio strategy kind of mandate to run soup for and to hold share? And also recognize that you might need to put more investment into ready-to-serve to kind of stem those declines. Do you need to fix the product or do you need to change something on the promotional strategy, which ended up causing some elasticities that were bigger than you thought? What do you think?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, first of all, when you step back, the entire wet soup category was down 3% and we were down 4%. And we were up in condensed by 2% and up in broth by 7%. In RTS, particularly in Chunky, is where we experienced our issue. And recall we did take net price realization. So that's a combination of pricing actions and also promotion actions. And that's not an easy one because you've got a marketplace where some of the marketplace is at high-low on promotions and some of it is EDLP. So finding that right rhythm is an important idea. The other thing is the competitive landscape. We have to take that into consideration as well.","In the case of Chunky, we actually had a promotion on pack label that caused consumer confusion. And we are largely out of that right now, so that one is behind us. And then finally, we launched a portfolio campaign, which really helped our condensed soup, but it did not do the job on brand Chunky. And so it wasn't until later in the quarter that we came in with dedicated advertising, and that will continue into quarter three.","And, again, I'm not really one to give the weather report, but it really was, relative to last year, a much warmer winter. So we really expect soup to grow modestly, consistent with other center-store categories. We are continuing to invest in the soup business and we are continuing to invest in the quality of the product. So it's not any one silver bullet. It's a combination of things.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Can I ask a follow-up to that? Did you have a different promotional strategy for condensed than you did for ready-to-serve or maybe more aggressive promotions on condensed?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Each segment of the soup business, we have a different promotion strategy and we work in joint business planning with retailers on the right execution to get the best return for the investment.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","What we had on Chunky was moving up on the promotive price points more so than the other categories inside of soup.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's what I was looking for. Thank you, Anthony.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you for the question. Congratulations again on a solid first half.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You spent a fair amount of time, Denise, in your prepared remarks talking about some of the challenges in terms of finding growth in this portfolio, some of the innovation, and you talked a little bit about M&A. Can you delve a little bit deeper in terms of your appetite for M&A in your efforts to transform this portfolio? Is there an increased sense of urgency, given the organic challenges? And what are you seeing out there in the landscape in terms of quality assets at reasonable prices?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, I'll start and then see where we go here. I think the first point to make is that we are confident that the portfolio today can deliver long-term sales in that 1% to 3% range on a currency neutral basis. And I think if you think about the portfolio roles that we've assigned to each of our divisions, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, moderate growth, in line with the categories. We have a very good portfolio in Global Biscuits and Snacks; that should certainly be able to grow towards the high end of that range. And then C-Fresh, the performance of late has not been that great and there's some reasons for that and we're going to lap some of those reasons, so we do expect much better top line growth out of Campbell Fresh than we've seen to-date. So I think if we just think about the portfolio that we have, we do expect that to grow.","On the other hand, and we pointed this out at CAGNY, we've made some good progress diversifying the portfolio and getting into higher growth spaces. We've done four acquisitions, as you know, over the last few years, and we will continue to look for opportunities to push further into higher growth spaces. That being said, we continue to be disciplined in how we approach M&A. Deals have to be strategically compelling, they have to be financially attractive, and they have to be able to create shareholder value for us. So we'll continue to do that and see how we go.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Any comments on the M&A environment?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I think it's still pretty rich. The multiples are still pretty high. That being said, like I said, we have a pretty diligent effort in the area and group of people looking at it. We have a pipeline. It's not a long, long list of opportunities. It's fairly tight. We continue to build relationships with companies that are perhaps family-owned or private and we'll just continue to work it.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thank you. Good morning.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Denise, I wanted to follow up. I think a couple of people have asked this question a little bit, but I want to try it slightly differently. Americas Simple Meals, what's kind of the volume outlook? I mean, clearly, you talked about the warm weather in the quarter. And then there's a much bigger picture issue here of just how you re-segmented the company and I want to call it kind of manage for cash, meaning that pricing is going to trump volume trends. But I was hoping you could kind of just talk about how, over the course of time, the volumes should trend within this segment? And just what's the strength of this concept that the company would accept better profits and maybe incur some negative volumes? Kind of what's the tolerance to accept an outcome like that? The margin performance in the quarter incredible in that segment and, obviously, you're being rewarded for it in the market today. But I would just like to hear your thoughts longer term.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, I think longer term we expect to strike the right balance of net price realization and volume. And we'd like to grow soup and Simple Meals modestly over time. That's in line with the expectations for those categories. So that portfolio role was thought through very carefully. And what we've learned over the years is, when we expect the categories to grow beyond what their portfolio momentum can do, we wind up spending inefficiently to get there. And so it's really an important idea to make sure that we are investing appropriately to be competitive in those categories and drive modest growth while we keep an eye on our margin expansion.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","The one follow-up on this point, Denise, is simply that \u2013 I think you said yourself that pricing in the soup category, especially in RTS, has just not been there for, I think you said, a decade or some really long period of time. Why would it be natural to assume that the volume growth should be like the rest of the store, if in fact this category should be taking pricing to kind of catch up relative to what it hasn't done in this previous decade?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, I mean, each segment of the category has its competitive set, and we run the soup business as a portfolio. And so when you think about the pricing spectrum in the portfolio, it's all the way from value condensed through higher end Slow Kettle and even into higher than that end refrigerated soup and then mainstream pricing in between. And so actually we think that the price realization on RTS was an important idea in the portfolio management of the category and we saw positive results on the condensed soup line this quarter.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Denise, I would like to come back to the ready-to-serve topic. You called out some of the elasticity impacts there in the quarter, but your price gap relative to your largest branded competitor, I think the widest it's been in a couple of years now. How impactful do you think that gap on the shelf has been to your volumes and might this be a situation where an increase in promo may end up being necessary to stabilize things? Thanks.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I do think that when we planned our net price realization for the year, we did not expect competition necessarily to follow. However, we did notice more of a gap, particularly on promotions than we had planned for. So we are course correcting accordingly.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I mean, is this a situation that we should think that it continues to weigh on (48:21) volume in the back half of the year as well?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, we have a pretty robust plan starting in the latter part of quarter two in January and all through quarter three and we were very pleased with the results in January.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, Denise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Can I ask about the sales investment that I think looking at the press release it looks as though there might have been some cutbacks on the selling side of things, if marketing spending was up a bit? What are you doing there? I know that a few years ago you outsourced merchandising to Acosta. Do you have people in the source merchandising? What is your strategy? Pruning that, where are you heading? And maybe also just generally on the promotional spending. I know it's already come up, but are you in general trying to pull back on the trade promotion spending where it's inefficient and where is that likely to head over time? Thank you.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. We did have higher advertising spending in the quarter and we continue to invest in advertising and brand building, and you'll see that continue into the second half. In terms of trade investment, again, we've focused on net price realization, which is the combination of pricing actions and promotion spending. We've created a Revenue Management group, which is working with Advanced Analytics to improve our effectiveness and make sure we take into consideration those programs that are working and not repeat those that aren't. So that's a change for us.","And finally, we always are looking to invest our promotion investment with customers for a better return, so a better return for them and a better return for us. So, we are focused more on how we increase the quality of our spending. And basically, it's the combination of the ACT that we expect to be between 24% and 25% of sales. That hasn't changed.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And the first part of your question on selling expense, selling expense is down, and we went through a pretty significant reorganization. As we redesigned the divisions, we also reduced some of the staffing levels in some of our sales organizations, which is coming through as well.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much, I will pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, thanks.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. I wanted to follow up on the gross margin expansion, from sort of a bigger picture standpoint. Given how significantly the magnitude of the upside has exceeded your original expectations this year, is it possible to talk a little bit more broadly about where you think gross margins can go over the next two to three years, given the continued flow through of cost savings and the mix impact between the segments? And is this accelerated growth in 2016 in any way a pull forward of some of the gross margin expansion, or I guess a reset that you hope to achieve over a multiyear period?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I can take that one. I mean, certainly we are very pleased with the cost savings we have been able to achieve and our gross margin performance. And I think one way to look at that is we are planning to invest some of those savings, and we're going to start to see that in the second half in new product launches and key brands and longer term innovation ideas, capability building in areas like digital and e-commerce.","That being said, we raised our savings target, so we think there's more savings to capture. That should benefit gross margin as well as our overhead costs, and I think that together with the role of Americas Simple Meals and Beverage targeting margin expansions, that we think there's enough funding there to do a couple of things. One is to make these investments in the business and to continue to target achieving our long-term growth objectives of 1% to 3% sales, 4% to 6% EBIT and 5% to 7% EPS. So I think we feel good about where we are, and continue to grow from \u2013 plan to grow from there.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And can I ask one follow-up, I guess just with respect to the long-term targets? You're now targeting 10% to 13% EBIT growth this year. Given all the investments that you're planning to make, I'm just curious why perhaps you didn't choose to reinvest more aggressively during the second half to facilitate even higher visibility toward those targets over the next year or two. Is that just an issue of near term constraints and how quickly you can implement the types of things you would like to do?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, that's exactly right.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We have a pretty disciplined process for making these types of investments, and the cost savings came in faster than we expected and we couldn't turn on a dime that quickly to reinvest. So we're starting to see some of it in the back half, and we'll continue to see that into fiscal 2017. But it really is those \u2013 it's just difficult to move that quickly on the investment side.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, Anthony.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just to clarify on the pacing of these cost savings, can you repeat where we are year-to-date against the $110 million to $120 million target and what sort of run rate you think you're on right now as far as achieving those in the second half of the year? And also a detail around that if you wouldn't mind. Could you give me a sense of how those split between cost of goods sold and what \u2013 marketing and selling and G&A and other expenses? Thanks.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll take that one. So against the now $300 million target, we did $85 million last year, we did $30 million in the first quarter, and we did $50 million in the second quarter. So year-to-date, first half we're at $80 million against our incremental savings target this year of now $120 million to $140 million. So we're kind of two-thirds of the way into that. That $80 million comes from a combination of head count and non-head count, and that splits about evenly.","In terms of P&L, it's about a third cost, two-thirds non-cost, and within the non-head count, it's \u2013 couple of examples of some of the big drivers would be travel and entertainment, non-working marketing, and on the cost side, some of our transportation cost savings initiative. We kind of redid our entire freight lane structure, and at the end of last year, we're seeing better rates. We're seeing almost no usage of the spot market. We're seeing better truck weights. We're seeing less miles. We're seeing less inter-plant shipments. So we're really seeing a lot of nice benefit on the transportation and warehousing side coming through too.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Would you say that was the biggest area that came in ahead of your plan?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, it's across the board. Each area is well ahead of what we initially or previously thought.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Okay. Thanks very much.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. A follow-up on the issue of reinvestment. You heard the surprise and kudos on the cost reduction at CAGNY, and there was also some curiosity in the crowd about what if reinvestment would work longer term? Today you're talking about marketing tactics with Chunky and the ramp up in marketing and promotion spending into the second half of the year. But, as you think long term, what are the things that you think will \u2013 what areas of reinvestment do you think you'll make in the core to change the trajectory of the core soup and other? Thanks.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's a great question and it's always been our intention to spend back a portion of the cost savings that we're realizing for the long term health of the business. Let me give you some examples. In the Americas, even though we're managing Americas for modest growth and margin expansion, the Americas still has some pockets of full force growth businesses. And we will continue to invest, first of all, in the quality of our products and making sure that we are looking at ingredients and the quality against our purpose of real food that matters for life's moments.","Second of all, we continue to invest in our sauces business, which is really healthy, and our broth business. And then finally, having made the acquisition of Plum Organics, we're incredibly pleased with the performance of that business, and see a lot of runway in the innovation pipeline to make smart investments and continue to cultivate relationships with Millennial parents.","In the Global Biscuits and Snacks front, we are very committed to expanding the Kelsen business in China and beyond. We have plans for increasing our footprint of the Tim Tam brands, and as I mentioned, we are continuously working on product quality, for example, the investment we're making back in our shapes business. We are in the United States continuing to work on our Goldfish brand, and we believe there's more growth in that brand, particularly as we move into products in the health and well-being space.","And then finally, C-Fresh is our full force growth, and we've been very pleased with the portfolio of brands and categories in the produce area and in the deli part of the perimeter, inclusive of our refrigerated soup, that between the beverages, the salad dressings, the hummus, the salsas and the soup, we have a lot to work with, and we have capabilities in each one of those categories in shelf stable that we can actually bring into the fresh space, and we have a very energized team across all three of these divisions to do so.","So I think based on five years ago, we have a lot more to work with, and so making sure that we make smart investments and have a discipline about it is important, but we have a lot of places where we can put our dollars.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with CLSA. Your line is open.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","I was wondering if you could just help me understand some of the cost savings breakdown a little bit further. You have your administrative expenses actually up 6% in the quarter and marketing down 5%, R&D it looks like down about 9%. I would have thought that with ZBB, maybe you would see something closer to the reverse. And so what's the right way to think about that? And then how do you also reconcile the savings on the cost of goods sold side? How much of that is coming from input costs versus cost savings?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, first on the admin expense. The primary driver of the increase is incentive compensation cost. Last year below target, this year above target. Ex-that, the admin would be down as a result of our cost savings initiative, so that's what you see on the P&L.","Inside of costs, the inflation on input cost was about flat compared to year ago. So it was neither a help nor a hindrance on gross margin, but it's certainly been more modest than it's been. And in costs, what you're seeing is a few different things coming out of the supply chain and kind of breaking down into three chunks. One is it's just better supply chain performance. And what we mean by that is that the plants are operating at higher efficiency levels, our customer service levels are back above our targets, and as a result, we see lower inter-plant shipments. We see fewer less-than-truckload shipments, so we have better weights. We actually have less miles. So that's all kind of within how we're operating.","And then we have a portion of our cost savings initiative that's coming through, and this is primarily in the area of transportation and the fact that we reworked our entire transportation network last year. So we re-contracted it, we have increased the committed carrier capacity. At the same time, we've achieved lower rates, and as a result of our service levels being where they are, we really had almost zero use of the spot market so that that's a premium cost we had last year, we don't have this year.","And the third bucket is what we call productivity, where we have specific action supply chain is taking to generate cost savings. And couple of examples within that would be the capacity additions in Bolthouse Farms and in our U.S. broth business have allowed us to repatriate production from co-packers, so we're seeing that benefit come through. The other one is our soup common platform initiative, which we're also seeing benefit on the P&L. And lastly, warehousing capacity, we've made some investments in our own internal warehousing so we've reduced several lines on third-party warehouses and some of those cost reductions are coming through as well.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","That's helpful. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on the marketing and R&D. How much of the change is pacing versus how much is driven by head count or more permanent reductions?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't have that number off the top of my head here. I mean, certainly we are seeing fairly significant savings in nonworking marketing coming through that line. And as Denise said, advertising and consumer spending is actually up in the quarter, but you see marketing expense on the P&L and we don't see it's (1:03:41) within selling and marketing is down, and that's primarily driven by all the work we've done on the cost savings side, both head count and some of our other nonworking marketing expenses.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And on the subject of R&D, because we continue to emphasize improving our innovation, we have brought in strong leadership. In our redesign, our product development is embedded in the business divisions with strong support from the center, so we believe we have a very aligned organization to be more agile and more responsive in the marketplace.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Our final question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Your line is open.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Erin.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi, thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could just provide a little bit more detail surrounding the relationship with retailers and how those conversations are going as you're working to improve the efficiency of your trade and marketing spending. Obviously, retailers are dependent on leading brands to drive store traffic and so \u2013 and obviously, you highlighted the competitive dynamics being extremely intense over the course of the call, so I was just kind of wondering how those discussions are kind of progressing and trending?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. We engage with our retailers on joint business planning where we will work with them on understanding their goals and working on plans that deliver on their goals and our goals, and then set expectations and the appropriate spending to achieve those expectations. And then there's a very rigorous process along the way to engage them with what's working and what isn't working, so there's course correcting, et cetera. So we're really positive about the relationships that we have in order to plan and execute the business.","We're very engaged with retailers on revitalizing the center-store. It has been sluggish and it is a major source of profit for retailers, and we believe that we've got the portfolio that not only can jazz the center-store, but it also toggles into the perimeter as well, because many of our brands in the center-store are used in conjunction with products that consumers will buy in the perimeter as well. So we continue to work with them on those kinds of goals. And they are mutual goals. So the way we look at our trade is as an investment where we hope to continue to build a return on that investment by good planning with retailers.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ken Gosnell, Vice President Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ken Gosnell","Thank you, Candice. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup\u2019s fiscal 2018.","With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO. As usual, we\u2019ve created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in a listen-only mode.","Today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risks. Please refer to slide two or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.","In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that changes the presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic post retirement benefit costs. Certain amounts in the prior year were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassifications did not impact EBIT. Also beginning in fiscal 2018, the business in Latin America is managed as part of the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment rather than the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment as in prior years. Prior period segment results have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change. An 8-K will be filed on December 8th along with our 10-Quarter, which will recast historical quarterly and annual financial information, reflecting both of these changes.","With that, let me turn the call over to Denise.","Denise Morrison","Thanks, Ken. Good morning and welcome everyone to our first quarter call. Today, we\u2019ll discuss our results in the quarter, our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and the actions we\u2019re taking to improve our performance and to position Campbell for long-term growth.","When we last spoke in September, we outlined our expectations for fiscal 2018 and indicated that we anticipated a challenging first half. However, the first quarter was weaker than we expected, particularly for our U.S. soup business. In the quarter, our organic sales declined 2%, driven primarily by declines in U.S. soup. Adjusted EBIT declined 14%. There were several factors that contributed to this performance.","First, in September, we discussed how a key customer\u2019s different promotional approach to the soup category would negatively impact our U.S. soup business in fiscal 2018. This had a larger impact on sales than originally anticipated, primarily due to a lower seasonal inventory build compared to a year ago. The dialogue with this key customer remains open, and I\u2019m very optimistic that we will reach a positive resolution. Second, unfavorable weather negatively impacted carrot crop yields and led to supply constraints and higher than expected cost. As a result, we placed customers on allocation in the quarter. We expect to be off allocation by December. And finally, the hurricane recovery efforts in Florida and Texas resulted in higher than expected supply chain costs, due to the surge in demand for transportation and logistics. We\u2019ll be impacted by this in the near-term but the cost impact will moderate over time.","As a result of the factors that impacted gross margin and our commitment to maintain investments in the business, we updated our fiscal 2018 guidance, this morning. For fiscal 2018, our outlook for sales remains unchanged. We continue to expect net sales to be in the range of minus 2 to flat for the year. However, we have lowered our earnings outlook, reflecting our gross margin performance in the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We now expect adjusted EBIT to change by minus 4% to minus 2%, previously minus 1 to plus 1%, and adjusted EPS to change by minus 3 to minus 1%, previously flat to plus 2%.","The operating environment remains challenging for the many reasons we\u2019ve cited over the past year, but we continue to believe that it\u2019s imperative to invest back in our business to differentiate our brands, to drive innovation, particularly in health and wellbeing, and snacking to accelerate our e-commerce capabilities and to diversify our portfolio. That\u2019s why we remain committed to reinvest a portion of our ongoing cost savings into the areas that hold the greatest prospects for growth. In Q1, we continued to invest back in our core business and in the pursuit of new growth opportunities including support for our product innovations, our real food efforts, building our e-commerce unit as well as funding longer term innovation efforts.","First, we\u2019re supporting our new product innovations such as Well Yes! soup and Chunky Maxx soups, Pepperidge Farm farmhouse cookies and Bolthouse Farms plant protein milk, a dairy alternative with 10 grams of protein. Second, in real food, we completed the transition out of BPA in our can linings in the United States and Canada, and continue to convert our soups to chicken with no antibiotics. Third, our newly formed e-commerce unit in North America has been very active. While small, our e-commerce sales increased significantly in the quarter. We launched several meal kits through our strategic partnership with Chef\u2019d. We also made progress on enhancing our distribution capabilities in partnership with DHL, opening a facility in Fort Worth and breaking ground on another in Ohio. This will help meet the growing demand for customization from both traditional and e-commerce customers.","In health and well-being space, we continue to fund Habit, a personalized nutrition start-up. Habit is an example of how we\u2019re investing in new models of innovation. Over time, we expect multiple business models to emerge. Following the national launch of its nutrition test kits in August, the Habit team is expanding rapidly and adding top talent. And we also continued our venture capital activities as the single limited partner in Acre Venture Partners. However, these efforts are not enough.","While we\u2019re moving in the right direction and positioning the Company for long-term success, our Q1 results are clear indication that we have more to do to complete our strategic transition, including more innovation, focused on health and wellbeing, and snacking, gaining a larger share of e-commerce revenue and a greater presence in growth channels, increased expansion in developing markets and continued focus on external development.","Speaking of external development, as you know, on September 27th, we delayed the closing of our acquisition of Pacific Foods of Oregon, pending their resolution of some recently filed litigation unrelated to Campbell. While the timing is not yet definite, we have reason to believe that conditions will be met that will allow us to complete the transaction by the end of 2017.","With that as context, I\u2019ll review our performance across our divisions. Let\u2019s start with Americas Simple Meals and Beverages where sales and operating earnings, both declined. The decline in the topline was driven primarily by U.S. soup and V8 beverages. U.S. soup sales declined 9%. As I stated earlier, a lower seasonal inventory build versus year ago at a key customer accounted for 7 points of the decline and 2 points were due to reduced consumer takeaway. There is positive performance in the balance of the marketplace, where our soup program has been well received and consumer takeaway is up slightly. We have strong business plans with our key customers; we\u2019re driving trial of our new products, Well Yes!, Chunky Maxx and Swanson soup kits. And we continue to support our brands with competitive levels of advertising and consumer promotion.","While we\u2019re experiencing private label competition in our broth business, private label market share in soup is below average for center store food categories and up slightly. We constantly innovate and test our products to ensure they meet or exceed consumer taste preferences. We believe that innovation and brand differentiation are critically important in the soup category, which is why we\u2019re continuing to invest in our brands.","The shelf-stable beverage category remained challenged, and sales of V8 products declined. Despite this decline, we\u2019re seeing positive consumption trends on V8 Vegetable Juice and V8 +Energy. We\u2019re pleased with the sales gains of our Simple Meal products, driven by Prego as well as sales growth in Canada in food service.","Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain challenging. And therefore, we\u2019re taking additional actions to improve our performance. We started to shift our soup marketing spending from equity building campaigns to a sharper focus on product attributes that differentiate Campbell brands. We\u2019re increasing in-store presence with stronger messaging and we\u2019re aggressively ramping up our ecommerce plans.","Now, shifting to our Global Biscuits and Snacks division.","Overall, I feel good about our performance in Global Biscuits and Snacks to start the year. This division delivered growth on both the top and bottom lines. Sales gains were primarily driven by the continued solid performance of Pepperidge Farm. This sales growth was fueled by our snacks business with one-two punch from crackers and cookies. Our Goldfish crackers continued to outperform the category in a meaningful way. In fact, Goldfish became the number one snack cracker in the category over the last quarter. The brand\u2019s continued growth was fueled by our increasing ounces into houses approach. This is all about providing wholesome delicious snacks that can be enjoyed in a variety of new packaging formats including single-serve multipacks.","The second driver of our sales growth was our cookie business behind the successful launch of the Farmhouse brand, Milano cookies and the rejuvenated Pepperidge Farm chunk cookie line. The Farmhouse launch is one of Pepperidge Farm\u2019s best product introductions in over a decade with strong trial and repeat. Made with simple ingredients, this thin, crispy cookie is the type of snack consumers are seeking and has been incremental to the category. We employed a similar approach with our Pepperidge Farm chunk cookies. We improved our recipes using larger chocolate chunks and cage-free eggs, while also updating and simplifying our packaging. It\u2019s satisfying to see our real food philosophy resonating with consumers in our cookie portfolio.","Outside the U.S., Asia-Pacific sales were mixed. Sales declines in Australia were partly offset by gains in Indonesia. We faced increased competitive activity in Australia\u2019s chocolate biscuits but delivered solid results in savory crackers behind the reintroduction of original shapes crackers where we gained share.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Campbell Fresh. In Campbell Fresh, sales were comparable to a year ago. We\u2019re encouraged that our CPG products grew for the second consecutive quarter behind Garden Fresh Gourmet and Bolthouse Farms salad dressing. Sales of Bolthouse Farms beverages were comparable to year ago. We are now back to normal beverage capacity. Our new co-packer was fully operational midway through the quarter. And our service levels steadily improved, helping us instill confidence with customers. As a result, we started to return to more normal levels of promotional activity, late in the quarter and expect that trend to continue in the second quarter.","Looking ahead, we have strong innovation plans in place with the continued rollout of Bolthouse Farms plant protein milk, new Garden Fresh Gourmet\u2019s fresh soup and salsa products in the first half and a range of Bolthouse Farms dressing and beverages in the back half.","Turning to farms. Sales of carrots declined in the quarter. Our carrot crops were negatively impacted by adverse weather. Due to these low yields, we placed customers on allocation in the quarter. Learning our lesson from a similar experience in 2016, the new Campbell Fresh team did not compromise the quality of carrots we delivered to customers. As stated earlier, we expect that we\u2019ll be off allocation by December. We continue to expect Campbell Fresh to return to profitable growth this fiscal year.","While I\u2019m not satisfied with our results this quarter, I\u2019m also not deterred. Despite challenges within U.S. soup, V8 and carrots, other parts of the business are growing. The Global Biscuits and Snacks division remained a bright spot, especially Pepperidge Farm. Simple Meals, Canada and food service performed well and the Campbell Fresh turnaround is progressing.","We\u2019re taking the appropriate steps to address our immediate issues and remain focused on the actions that will position Campbell for long-term growth. We will continue to invest to differentiate our brands, enhance our real food credentials, drive innovation, particularly in health and wellbeing and snacking, build our e-commerce organization, and pursue smart external development.","Thank you. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and revise 2018 guidance.","Our first quarter results were below our expectations, largely for three reasons. First, while we anticipated that U.S. soup sales would be negatively impacted by reduced support levels with a key customer, the sales decline in the quarter was more than anticipated, primarily due to a lower seasonal inventory build with this same customer, which accounted for 7 points of the soup sales decline. Given the seasonality of our soup business, quarterly fluctuations in retailer inventory levels are mostly timing related. Second, as a result of unfavorable weather, we experienced lower crop yields on carrots, which had a negative impact on our gross margin performance. And third, also impacting our gross margin, we experienced higher transportation and logistics costs, reflecting the impact of industry-wide carrier capacity issues.","On a positive note, we continued to make progress against our cost savings target of $450 million by the end of fiscal 2020, delivering another $20 million of savings in the quarter. This brings the program-to-date total to $345 million. And as Denise highlighted, we will continue to reinvest a portion of the savings back into the business to drive growth over the long term.","As you\u2019ve seen in the release, we are revising our full year guidance. While we are not changing our range for sales, we are lowering the ranges for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS by 3 percentage points, which equates to about $45 million in EBIT. This change primarily reflects the impact of carrier shortages on our transportation and logistics costs and the unanticipated impact of the weather-related carrot yield issue.","Now, I\u2019ll review our results in more detail.","For the first quarter, as reported and organic sales declined by 2%. The decline in organic sales was driven by lower sales in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, partly offset by growth in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Adjusted EBIT decreased 14% to $417 million, reflecting a lower adjusted gross margin, lower sales, and higher administrative expenses, partly offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Reflecting a reduction in the tax rate and a lower share count, adjusted EPS decreased 8% or $0.08 to $0.92 per share.","Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Organic net sales declined 2%, all driven by lower volume. Volume declined in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, reflecting declines in U.S. soup and V8 beverages, partly offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces. Volumes also declined in Campbell Fresh, which was entirely attributable to the decline of carrot, a direct result of placing customers on allocation, as Denise mentioned earlier. This was partly offset by volume gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks, reflecting continued momentum on Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookie.","Overall, promotional spending rates were comparable to the prior year. And although it rounds to zero on the chart, we did have a slightly positive impact from currency translation, principally the Canadian and Australian dollar, bringing the change in our as reported sales to minus 2%.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased 210 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 250 basis points. Almost two-thirds of this was cost inflation, which on a rate basis increased about 2.5%, reflecting higher prices on meat, steel cans, aluminum and dairy. The remaining third was driven by several factors. As I mentioned, we had higher carrot costs and higher transportation and logistics costs. In addition, we incurred losses on open commodity hedges as compared to gains in the prior year quarter, and we had higher costs associated with investments in our real food initiative. These negative drivers were partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiative. Mix had a negative impact of 80 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower U.S. soup sales. Pricing and promotional spending had little to know impact on the quarter. Lastly, our supply chain productivity program, which is incremental to our cost savings program, contributed 130 basis points of margin improvement. All-in, our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased 210 basis points to 36.5%.","Marketing and selling expenses declined 5% in the quarter, reflecting lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, and benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Adjusted administrative expenses increased 17%, primarily due to higher information technology costs, expenses related to the pending acquisition of Pacific Foods, inflation and investments in long-term innovation. Looking ahead, we do not expect this rate of increase in administrative expenses for the balance of the year.","For additional perspective on our performance. This chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.08 from $1 in the prior year quarter to $0.92 per share in the current quarter. On a currency neutral basis, the decline in adjusted EBIT had a negative $0.16 impact on EPS, two-thirds of which was driven by our gross margin performance. Net interest expense was up $2 million, reflecting higher rates and had no impact on EPS.","Currency translation from both a stronger Canadian and Australian dollar added a penny EPS benefit. Using access cash flow to repurchase shares reduced our share count, adding a $0.03 EPS benefit. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter declined by about 4 percentage points to 28.2%. The lower adjusted tax rate in the current quarter was driven by favorable settlement of certain U.S. state tax matters. The lower tax rate increased adjusted EPS by $0.05, completing the bridge to $0.92 per share.","Now, turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales declined 5%, driven primarily by declines in U.S. soup and V8 beverages, partly offset by gains in Simple Meals driven by Prego pasta sauces and excluding the favorable impact of current translation, gains in our retail business in Canada and our North America food service business. Sales of U.S. soup decreased 9%, driven primarily by declines in condensed and broth. The lower sales reflect a 7-point decrease due to a lower seasonal build of retailer inventory. Consumer takeaway measured channels declined by 2% in the quarter. Both the inventory-driven decline and reduction in consumer takeaways reflect our performance with a key customer we\u2019ve referenced.","Operating earnings decrease 14% in the quarter to $328 million. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales volume and a lower gross margin percentage, partly offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Segment gross margin performance was impacted by higher transportation and logistics costs and negative mix.","Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending October 29, 2017, the category as a whole increased 10 basis points. Our sales in measured channels declined 40 basis points. We had a 58.5% market share for the 52-week period with a share loss of 30 basis points. Private label grew share by 130 basis points, primarily reflecting gains in broth, finishing at 14.3%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 27.2%, declining 100 basis points.","In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2%, driven by continued gains in Goldfish crackers, which benefitted from promotional activity and new items and gains in Pepperidge Farm cookies, benefitting from the launch of farmhouse cookies as well as growth of Milano and chunk cookies.","Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, biscuit sales in the Asia Pacific region were down slightly as lower sales in Arnott\u2019s Australia were partly offset by growth in Indonesia. Operating earnings increased 4% to $120 million, primarily driven by higher sales volumes.","In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales were comparable to the prior year at $234 million as sales gains of carrot ingredient, Garden Fresh Gourmet and Bolthouse Farms salad dressings were offset by declines in carrots. Sales of Bolthouse Farm beverages were comparable to the prior year. With our new beverage co-packer now up and running, we expect to have sufficient product supply to support our promotional program going forward. As a result of the crop yield issue, carrot sales were on allocation for part of the quarter, resulting in the sales decline.","The segment generated a $6 million operating loss for the quarter as compared to $1 million of earnings a year ago. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the cost impact of lower carrot yield.","Cash from operations was $188 million compared to $221 million in 2017. The decline reflects higher payments on hedging activities and higher seasonal working capital requirements, partly offset by higher cash earnings. For the full year, we expect to generate strong cash flow from operations of approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $58 million, $10 million higher than the prior year. We paid dividends, totaling $111 million compared to $100 million in 2017. The increase reflects our 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, as announced in September of fiscal 2017. In aggregate, we repurchased $86 million of shares in the quarter, $75 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balances of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt of $3.3 billion was comparable to last year.","Now, I\u2019ll review our revised 2018 outlook. As I said earlier, we continue to expect sales to change by minus 2% to 0%. Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect sales declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, driven primarily by U.S .soup will be partly offset by growth in Global Biscuits and Snacks and in Campbell Fresh.","We now expect our adjusted gross margin percentage to be comparable to last year, lower than previously anticipated, primarily due to higher transportation and logistics costs and the cost impact of lower carrot yields. Reflecting the reduced expectation on gross margin, we now expect adjusted EBIT to decline by minus 4% to minus 2%, and adjusted EPS to decline by minus 3% to minus 1%. Both earnings ranges are 3 percentage points below our previous expectation.","We continue to expect our cost savings program which is incremental to our ongoing supply chain productivity gains to deliver $60 million to $70 million of savings, most of which will impact costs. This guidance assumes that the impact of currency translation will be nominal and that the adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 32%. Given the seasonality of our business and the timing of these unforeseen cost issues, we expect to see significantly weaker performance in the second quarter followed by improvement in the second half.","That concludes my remarks. And now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time, out of fairness to the other callers, please ask only one question at a time. Okay, Candice?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Thank you very much. One of the questions I get on Campbell, Denise, is, what is the Board\u2019s thought on the carrot business at this point? Because obviously, the carrot business, I think has underperformed expectations, it\u2019s fair to say. And at this point, it\u2019s volatile and unpredictable. And from an investor perspective, that leads to uncertainty which leads to lower multiples. So, I\u2019m just curious how committed the Board is to sort of keeping the carrot business itself as opposed to the rest of Bolthouse, which obviously still has some upside from a packaged food perspective?","Denise Morrison","There is no question, Ken, that we have experienced volatility in the carrot business due primarily to weather issues in California dealing with extremes in rain and heat, which has affected the crop. While we can\u2019t control the weather, we can control what we do about it. And I believe that we did the right thing this time around by putting customers on allocation, not harvesting early, and keeping the quality of our carrot. Understand that the role of carrots in this business is it\u2019s the scale of distribution for the CPG products. And one of the reasons why we acquired the business was to grow the CPG portion and recognize that the carrots are the chassis for distribution at best pricing. So, we\u2019ll continue to take this into consideration going forward. We\u2019d like to get to the point of stability in carrots and growth in CPG, and that\u2019s our strategy.","Ken Goldman","Okay. Thank you for that. My follow-up is, Denise, you talked about getting a little bit optimistic or maybe you are optimistic about conversations with the key customer that the promotion has maybe been lost early with. Can you give us a little more color where that optimism comes from and when the earliest it might be that you might get that promotion back in some form?","Denise Morrison","Well, I can\u2019t talk about any specifics. I can say that the dialogue remains open and it\u2019s very positive.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Grainger","I wanted to ask another follow-up on the soup issue. Most of your competitors have characterized this specific circumstance in soup with this one retailer as a very isolated case. And I think what we\u2019re hearing from others is that there is just a need for greater levels of innovation, and that\u2019s going to be sufficient to protect relationships with key retailers, provide value for all stakeholders and avoid having others run into similar situation. So, I guess, do you agree with that characterization of soup being an isolated pressure point in the industry? And if that\u2019s true, what could you have done differently or do you need to do differently to avoid this, going forward? To the extent that this perhaps is an issue that\u2019s disproportionally affecting the condensed business, is there a need to try and bring some type of innovation to that area or the business that\u2019s been a little bit more static from a product standpoint in recent years?","Denise Morrison","I\u2019ll answer that question from a couple of perspectives. First of all, in the rest of the market, soup program has been very strong. New products have been well-received, new Well Yes! is at 83% ACV distributions, we're supporting the brands, new Chunky Maxx has hit the market now with 40% more protein, and protein is really on trend. So, we\u2019re pretty pleased with the performance in the rest of the market with consumption up slightly. So that -- and we believe we\u2019ll continue to see that momentum into the second quarter. The other fact is that our other businesses in this key retailer are incredibly robust. So, I would say that I do agree that the soup situation is isolated.","Matthew Grainger","And I know it\u2019s going to be difficult to comment on this and you might just defer. But, given -- obviously, you ran the numbers and didn\u2019t want to meet their demands on this particular category or in the soup category. And you\u2019re seeing solid consumption or modest growth in other customers in the category. Given that dynamic, I mean, do you have a sense of how they view the return profile of their approach to the soup category this year, given that they\u2019re losing a fair amount of share in a relatively high margin category and what the implications of that might be for the likelihood of seeing similar situations going forward?","Denise Morrison","You\u2019re right. I\u2019ll defer.","Matthew Grainger","All right. I had to try. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Andrew Lazar","Just one last one on that particular issue. When you talk about the dialogue being positive and open, would this be something that potentially could impact positively this fiscal year or are we at a point where plans are in place such that -- and you\u2019ve done things that obviously other retailers seem to be effective. Is it really more of an FY19 scenario, or is there some way to salvage some of this year? And then, Anthony, I think at the last call, you mentioned that this promotional issue would probably be about a 1% top-line drag for the full year for the Company as a whole. Is that still around where you think we are or has the first quarter led that to be somewhat different then? Thank you.","Denise Morrison","I\u2019ll take the first part, Andrew. We said this in September, but we expect that the first half on soup will be weaker than a year ago, and we expect some more momentum in the second half.","Anthony DiSilvestro","On your other question, yes, we did say that the soup performance would have about a point impact on total Company. I would say it still rounds to 1 but probably a little bit higher.","Andrew Lazar","Okay. And then, the last thing would just be, I think you mentioned, obviously a big part of what we saw in the fiscal first quarter was the lower year-over-year inventory builds. In fiscal 2Q, was there also an inventory build seasonally last year that we wouldn\u2019t get this year or would soup shipments look a little bit like consumption this time around as we go into the 2Q?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. The seasonal build goes through the second quarter, I mean, it\u2019s kind of hard to say. Obviously, we didn\u2019t build as much in Q1. But, given where we sit today and given our outlook for consumption, it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s going to happen relative to inventory moves going forward. But, I would expect them to be significantly more muted than the Q1 impact.","Andrew Lazar","Got it, okay. Thanks everybody, have a nice holiday.","Denise Morrison","Okay. Thank you. You too.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Moskow","Hi. I wanted to make sure that I understood that comment too, Anthony. So, you are saying that -- is there still deloading that you expect in second quarter; in other words that your shipments will trail soup consumption in second quarter as well? And also, is that just at this one retailer or is that across multiple retailers that you\u2019re seeing the deloading?","Anthony DiSilvestro","So, I\u2019d be careful with the term deloading. Yes, the impact is all one customer. And basically, you have a curve that builds kind of steeply in Q1 and less steeply in Q2, and certainly, the seasonal build through Q1 was significantly below last year. And that curve starts to kind of come down a little bit or increase at a slower rate in the second quarter. And it\u2019s really difficult to predict shipments vis-\u00e0-vis consumption, but I would expect to have a much more tighter delta between shipments and consumption in the second quarter than the first.","Robert Moskow","Okay, I think I get it. And in one of your slides, you show that private label soup has expanded market share by over a 100 basis points. Has this retailer really pushed private label as a substitute for your brand in the category or is that private label gain happening across multiple retailers?","Denise Morrison","I don\u2019t think private label is a new phenomenon. Private label is pretty prevalent. And what we have seen is more of a push on private label in the broth business in the market at large. Actually, our -- the share that private label has of condensed soup and RTS soup is significantly below the average in center store categories and only up slightly. But broth has definitely been impacted.","Robert Moskow","And how would you expect that to impact the Pacific Foods business? I think Pacific is largely broth, isn\u2019t it?","Denise Morrison","The Pacific Foods brand is highly differentiated, being organic and natural. So, we believe that will be a good add to our line.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bryan Spillane","I just wanted to follow up on gross margin. I just wanted to make sure I heard this right. Are you expecting that gross margin will be under worse pressure or more pressure in 2Q versus 1Q and then sort of get better in the second half? And I guess just a follow-up on that is are you doing -- what are the remedial actions to improve gross margins? Are you raising prices or pulling through more productivity? Just trying to understand sort of what will get the gross margins to improve as we go through the year.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I think the first part of that question is understanding what happened in the first quarter. I mean, we were down couple of hundred basis points, primarily due to three things, two of which we\u2019re going to stay on the year and one of which is going to turn. The higher transportation and logistics costs certainly had a negative impact on Q1 that\u2019s going to impact the year. The second is the carrot. A cost issue related to yield that impacted the first quarter and will also stick on the year. The third, and this one is primarily timing, we took down 9% in the first quarter. There is a pretty significant negative mix impact from that and most of that should turn. So, as we look at the full year now, we would say, we expect gross margin to be about flat. And I think the way to decompose that is to think about our productivity savings. So, we\u2019re targeting 3% of costs. And that will just about offset cost inflation as well as some of the investments we\u2019re making in real food. Denise mentioned what they were. And then, the other two components, we had previously expected and still expect to deliver cost savings of $60 million to $70 million, most of which will impact costs and to a largest extent, that\u2019s largely offset now by these unanticipated cost issues, both transportation and logistics, as well as the carrot yield. Now, in terms of phasing, given the seasonality of the soup business, certainly the consumption expectation will have a more significant impact on Q2. The timing of those two cost issues, transportation and logistics and carrots, more impactful on Q2, and then, we would expect to see improvement in the back half.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. So, -- but 2Q isn\u2019t [ph] more pressure than 1Q. I guess, in 1Q, you also had a pretty difficult gross margin for carrot compared to last year...","Anthony DiSilvestro","No. But relative to second half, yes, but not relative to 2Q.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Strycula of UBS. Your line is now open.","Steve Strycula","Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on Bryan\u2019s question. Does this imply that gross margin in the back half of the year going to be up about 150 basis points or greater? Just want to make sure I am thinking about that correctly. And I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, we would expect to be up in the second half, for sure.","Steve Strycula","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Denise, can you comment a little bit about the overall category right now? Are you seeing any shrinkage in total points of distribution at retail across the U.S. channel place right now or are you just seeing a little bit of rotation between the little bit of private label and branded mix here and there? Thanks.","Denise Morrison","Just for clarification, because we\u2019re in the snacks category and many fresh categories, are you referring to the soup category?","Steve Strycula","Yes, specifically. But while, you\u2019re at it, if you want to comment on snacking, given what we\u2019re seeing with Kellogg\u2019s DSD transition that would be helpful too. Thanks.","Denise Morrison","Okay. Let me star there. In our Pepperidge Farm business, we\u2019ve seen a lot of robust consumption, particularly on Goldfish and cookies as I stated before. We continue to increase our shelf space merchandising. So, they are really doing a great job. In Campbell Fresh, again, the CPG part of the business has returned to growth, up a couple of points for the second consecutive quarter. And we didn\u2019t start promoting beverages until October. So, we will now return to a normal promotion schedule in quarter two and we have a huge innovation suite coming to market in quarter three. So, we believe that the CPG part of Campbell Fresh will have momentum. In the soup category and the rest of the market, we continue to see robust plans. We do audit shelf every year, but we have not gotten results of that. We\u2019ll let you know when we do. And so, we\u2019re just running our play.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Chris Growe","Just a question for you to follow-up on an early question in relation to the change in promotional program at this key customer. If you were to effect some sort of plan now or soon, given the seasonality of this business, could it be in place by the end of the soup season? Could you guys be promoting relatively quickly if something got worked out there?","Denise Morrison","Yes. I\u2019m not going to comment on the specifics of customer programs.","Chris Growe","Okay. Even the timing of what you could if effect the promotion?","Denise Morrison","Yes. I mean, all I\u2019m willing to say is that we are in open discussion and positive about it.","Chris Growe","And then, if I could just ask a quick question on the margin recovery in the C-Fresh division. You are back to promoting more heavily. I think you mentioned that Anthony, and you do have some easy comps. And I know carrot costs will be an ongoing issue. But, it seems like that should get back to generating operating profit. Does that happen as quickly as Q2 or is there an upfront investment that may kind of slow that rebuild in profitability of division?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Couple of things, I would say, if we didn\u2019t have this yield issue in Q1, Campbell Fresh division would generated a profit. So, yes, it can turn around pretty quickly. We\u2019ll have a little bit of lingering impact of the carrot yield issue into the second quarter. Denise mentioned, we\u2019re on allocation; that should be behind us by December. So, we would expect to see profitability pretty quick in Campbell Fresh. And as we\u2019ve said before on a full year basis, we would expect to deliver both top and bottom-line growth.","Denise Morrison","Chris, in addition, we have a very robust supply chain productivity program. Since we\u2019ve integrated the supply chain into Campbell\u2019s and put them on our productivity program, we have a very good line of sight to some significant cost savings, which will enhance the profitability of the business.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","David Palmer","Good morning. Just a follow-up question, just broadly on soup. And what -- is there any auditing that you\u2019ve done about how you\u2019ve gotten here with the retailer issues in soup, and particularly with regard to price gap to private label and the push behind private label? One theory is that the price gaps have widened over recent years. And I think a natural concern was that these issues wouldn\u2019t just be local to one retailer in the future that we would see broader private label pushes by other retailers. So, any comments on that would be helpful. Thank you.","Denise Morrison","We do very robust analytics on our price gaps and thresholds of the brands versus private label. So, we have a good indication of what that looks like, both from the regular retail pricing and also the merchandising pricing with the frequency that we merchandise. So, that\u2019s under constant watch. And that\u2019s not different. We\u2019ve been doing that forever. So, I would just say that in the broth business, what we have done to address private label, and that\u2019s where we have experienced the competition, is, we\u2019ve changed our advertising messaging more to house once and is differentiated versus private label, starting with the fact that the first ingredient in Swanson is chicken stack whereas the first ingredient in most private labels is water. And so, we\u2019re calling attention to some of the attributes that distinguish the Swanson brand from private label. And then, of course, the pending acquisition of Pacific, as I mentioned, we\u2019re pretty enthusiastic about what differentiation that brand brings to the line. In RTS and condensed, private label is a factor but it\u2019s really under average, and we haven\u2019t seen an increase. I mean, it\u2019s been up slightly. But, we continue to watch it and we\u2019ll make sure we continue to be competitive.","David Palmer","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi Research. Your line is now open.","David Driscoll","So apologies for some more soup questions that keep coming. Soup inventory, Anthony, could you just talk about why this doesn\u2019t impact guidance? I think you called out the carrot issue and the supply chain, the freight issue as the big changes to the guidance. But, I\u2019m not a 100% clear why the soup inventory issues in Q1 don\u2019t also impact the guidance? And the simple question would be, if the big retailer is not ordering product, why doesn\u2019t this have some kind of impact on upcoming sales?","Anthony DiSilvestro","So, it\u2019s probably the end of that question. I think it\u2019s likely that lower inventory would build -- will have -- is an indicator of near-term consumption. So, I think we would expect to see some consumption decline. And then, the other question, yes, both the carrot issue and the freight issues are both unanticipated in impacting the year. But, I think the way to think about retailer inventory, they start our fiscal year at relatively low level; they go through a significant increase in Q1 and Q2 and then come back down in the back half. So, it really is volatility amongst the quarters as opposed to an impact for us on our fiscal year, given our fiscal year is about when those inventories are at their lowest point. So that one is more about timing, which is why we didn\u2019t talk about it in terms of our full year guidance.","David Driscoll","And then, related to that, soup takeaway is down 2% and this isn\u2019t -- and soup is not really a factor in the guidance change. Is it you fair to say that your full-year expectation for the soup season is down about 2%?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I don\u2019t want to give you a specific number, but probably a little south of that.","David Driscoll","Lastly for me is just on freight. Can you just talk about how this plays out over time? I am a little confused about the factors here. We\u2019ve got a Hurricane truck availability issue that should improve. That feels like it\u2019s going to be good as time progresses. I believe there are some new rules coming that are negative. So, this freight issue, is the cost -- is this going to get better or is it going to get worse as times progresses?","Anthony DiSilvestro","This one is hard to say. I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve experienced the impact of the Hurricanes and the shortages. And it just pushed us out into the spot market. And when that happens, it certainly drives up cost. We\u2019ve had to do some more inner plant and some -- experienced some more warehousing costs as we\u2019ve tried to rebalance kind of the network to get around some of that. It is our expectation for this impact to moderate as we go through the rest of our fiscal year. But, it\u2019s taken a while. And as we sit here today, if you look at any kind of capacity report, it\u2019s still well above where it\u2019s been over the last six or seven years. So, I can\u2019t tell you exactly when that\u2019s going to moderate, but we\u2019re assuming that\u2019s going to take a little while.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jason English","Thank you guys for taking the question. I am going to cramp two questions in, if I may. First, in terms of topline drivers, can you help us understand why you are not seeing any sort of promo price mix benefit as you suffer so much volume loss related to subsidized promoted sales?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I can take that one. What\u2019s happening, and the reason you don\u2019t see a promotional lift in terms of sales is there is a couple of offsets. One is, if you look at the dollar spend for promo on soup, for example, it is down double digit in the first quarter. But what\u2019s happening is, we\u2019re thinning back a little bit on broth; we\u2019re spending back a little bit on both the Prego business and on V8. And the other reason you don\u2019t see as much as with soup volumes being down as part of mostly related to that inventory issue, we calculate trade rates on a rate basis. So, the volume decline is muting the promotional rate a little bit. But, I think the better indicator is on a dollar basis, our trade is down significantly on soup.","Jason English","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, the second question, I think it comes back to a lot of the questions you\u2019ve gotten today. But also to tether back to the believability of your ability to get the acceleration you are talking about on the back half. Denise, I think you kind of vaguely implied that that maybe soup could -- you are expecting to grow in the back half. And Steve asked a question about gross margin. I mean, minimum, it sounds like your guidance applies a 150 basis points of expansion, minimum in the back half of the year. Can you give us a little more teeth or a little more meat on the bone in terms of the drivers of those dynamics to help restore some creditability in that path of acceleration?","Denise Morrison","Yes. We said in September and continue to believe that we will have a weaker first half than second half in soup, based on what we know at this point. And in terms of the gross margin, Anthony, do you want to handle that one?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I\u2019d say, typically, our cost productivity program is more kind of, I would say, backend weighted as opposed to frontend, given the seasonality of the business and our ability to getting into some of the plans, when there is some downtime. So, that\u2019s certainly more back half than front half. The other thing is, this mix issue of soup in the first quarter in effect should turn as we go through the balance of the year. So, that\u2019s a positive. And the third, as I said before, on our cost savings program, which is in addition to the productivity program, a lot of that should be coming in the back half as well. So, we do expect to see improved gross margin performance in the back half.","Denise Morrison","Yes. In the back half, we have a greater mix in our Global Biscuits and Snacks business in Campbell Fresh.","Operator","And our final question comes from line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Michael Lavery","I just want to understand this, Anthony, something you just said is, if I\u2019m hearing right, it sounds like you\u2019re expecting the 7 points of lost inventory build to come back over the course of the year. And if that\u2019s correct, can you explain why you think that\u2019s the case?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I\u2019ll go back to something I said a little earlier. And you need to understand the seasonality of the soup business and what happens to retailer inventory levels. I think the easiest way to explain it is that our fiscal year is essentially the lowest point of retailer inventory. And then, they build -- and we\u2019re talking about significant build in the first and second quarters. So, where you strike that line on that inventory build between Q1 and Q2, just introduces volatility amongst the quarters. By the time we get to the end of the fiscal year, those inventory levels would -- will come out. So, any kind of lower seasonal build here means less of a seasonal decline on the back half. So, it kind of nets itself out a little bit.","Denise Morrison","Okay. The main thing to focus on is the consumption; in the quarter, soup consumption was down 2.3%.","Michael Lavery","Can you help me understand a little bit of the dynamics with this promotional change? Because that\u2019s how you\u2019ve typically characterized it. But, it also sounds like if it\u2019s simply were a question of spending more money and adding promotional dollars and that would benefit you, then, you would have probably simply just done it. So, how many pieces of the puzzle are there, beyond that? Because it sounds like there is potentially or maybe even probably some shelf space changes. Is that a fair assumption? And if so, then, wouldn\u2019t that perhaps have a lasting impact on the inventory level through the course of the year?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I would say, we really haven\u2019t seen any shelf space changes. When we deal with our customers, we agree around a promotional program that includes new items; it includes merchandising amongst other things, and promotional programming. And so, it isn\u2019t just a dollars and cents kind of thing. I think the thing that impacts the inventory build is what is the merchandising program on a go forward basis? And that\u2019s why I said earlier that this lower retailer inventory build could be indication of what\u2019s going to happen to consumption, in say for example, the second quarter.","Michael Lavery","Okay, thanks. And just one last unrelated one. You touched on significant growth on your e-commerce business. Can you just give a sense across your portfolio of what types of products lend itself to good performance online? I would assume it probably varies a bit. Are there some that tend to do much better than others and what would those be?","Denise Morrison","Yes. We have a couple of things going on there. And our e-commerce business is still small and for the industry, it\u2019s small. But, we\u2019re focused on building capabilities in terms of really understanding the consumers\u2019 path to purchase in that space. We are working predominantly with pure play e-tailers and also omni, and we\u2019re working with Chef\u2019d on meal kits in that space. So, we\u2019re trying some different things. We\u2019re working literally across all of our brands and bundling brands based on what the customer wants to do in that space. So, I think we\u2019re trying a lot of things. One of the things that\u2019s very encouraging though is we\u2019ve brought in some top talent. And we believe that as more consumers shift to e-commerce, whether it\u2019s order online pick up at store or order online and deliver to home, will be well-poised to participate and lead in that space.","Operator","Thank you.

And welcome to the Campbell Soup Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in the listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ken Gosnell, Vice President, Finance Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. ","Ken Gosnell","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Campbell\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. As usual, we\u2019ve created slides that accompany our earnings presentation. You will find these slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who will participate in a listen-only mode.","Turning to Slide 2, today we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide two or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in the appendix of this presentation.","Additionally, we filed an 8-K this morning, which recaps historical quarterly and year-to-date unaudited financial information, reflecting the discontinued operation and changes in our segment reporting, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the GAAP presentation.","On Slide three, you can see the agenda we will cover today. With us on the call today are Mark Clouse, Campbell\u2019s President and CEO and Anthony DiSilvestro, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will share his perspective on our performance in the quarter and then progress we have made against our strategic initiatives. Then Anthony will walk through the financial details of the quarter, as well as our fiscal 2019 financial guidance.","One final item before we open our discussion for the quarter, we would like to remind analysts and institutional investors that we will hold our 2019 investor Day at Campbell's world headquarters in Camden on Thursday, June the 13th.","With that, let me turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Clouse","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. For clarity, this morning I will make high level comments about our total company performance, described as total combined results in our press release, as it reflects how we manage the business during the quarter and enables an apples-to-apples comparison against our past performance. Anthony will bridge the various components of our results, including both continuing and discontinued operations given the announced sale of Campbell Fresh.","At a high level, much like last quarter, we are doing what we said we would. Throughout the third quarter, we continue to make steady progress against the key priorities we outlined last August in our strategic and portfolio review, including stabilizing our in-market performance, integrating the Snyder's Lance business and accelerating growth in our U.S. snacks portfolio. We also continue to deliver our enterprise cost savings program, while focusing and optimizing our portfolio through divestitures.","I'm even more encouraged that in this quarter, we delivered results that were ahead of our expectations. This marks the third consecutive quarter this year, where we have met or exceeded our goals, which is a necessary first step in our journey to deliver steady and dependable results.","Based on our performance through three quarters and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect adjusted net EPS to increase from our previous guidance range of $2.45 to $2.53 per share to $2.50 to $2.55 per share, reflecting improvements in our business, as well as the expected impact of the Campbell Fresh divestiture.","Looking at our total combined results in the quarter. Sales increased 12% and organic sales within continuing operations were comparable to the prior year. We had stable top line performance with organic sales trends improving in the quarter relative to the first half.","Performance in the quarter reflected strength within global biscuits and snacks, driven by the continued growth of the U.S. snacks portfolio. Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's Lance grew share in the majority of their core brands. Meanwhile, the meals and beverage business is beginning to show signs of stabilization. This is clearly a work in progress, but I'm encouraged by the improved trends.","We also made progress on gross margin in the quarter, an important proof point in our turnaround. Adjusted combined gross margin declined 40 basis points in the quarter, a material improvement versus the first half, which was down 460 basis points. The Q3 decline was driven by the negative mix impact of the Snyder's Lance acquisition and cost inflation.","However, ongoing productivity improvements continued strong execution on our base cost savings programs, including the value capture of the Snyder's Lance synergies, we're able to mitigate a significant amount of the headwinds. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share declining compared to a year ago, but stronger than our expectations.","The team has continued to successfully execute our multi-year enterprise cost savings program. This quarter, we delivered $55 million in savings including the Snyder's Lance synergies. That brings year-to-date savings to $150 million, which is ahead of our original plan of $120 million.","We now expect to deliver $180 million in cost savings in fiscal 2019, including savings from Campbell Fresh. This will help offset costs headwinds we\u2019re managing, while still delivering our commitments. And going forward, will serve as fuel for investing back in the business for growth.","Another area of emphasis for the company is cash flow from operations, which year-to-date increased to $1.1 billion, reflecting major improvements in working capital. We continue to demonstrate increased discipline and effectiveness in optimizing our working capital and capital spending.","Turning to a discussion of our segments on Slide 9, let's start with our meals and beverages segment. Performance continues to be mixed across our brands, but our results were ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year compared to declines of 3% in the first half of fiscal 2019. The meals and beverage business is showing signs of stabilization, particularly from a profitability perspective.","Declines in operating earnings moderated in the quarter as we continued to deliver base enablers, decreased inefficient promotional spending and benefited from our recent pricing actions. While we are encouraged by the improved sales and profit trends, there is much work ahead.","On the U.S. soup business, sales were comparable to a year ago. In market consumption declined 2.6% in the quarter, a noticeable improvement in trend versus the first half of the year, which was down 5.5%. The difference between sales and in market consumption was driven by favorable timing on new revenue recognition accounting, which offset the consumption decline and some expected inventory reduction to start the quarter.","We are successfully executing our fiscal '19 soup plans, which are focused on improving the fundamentals of the business, including pricing and promotion, marketing and innovation. This will establish a solid foundation that we can build upon in the future.","In particular, I'm encouraged with the progress the team is making in stabilizing the condensed soup portfolio, and improving trends with key retail partners. In fact, over the latest four weeks, condensed soup consumption was positive.","While we have started to chip away at the challenges, we still have much to do to position this business for improved and sustainable results. At our Investor Day next week, we will provide an overview of our go forward plans for how we will win in soup.","As I stated last quarter, changing the trajectory of this important business will require a holistic approach to building consumer relevance through strengthening the product, the packaging and the pricing structure. Additionally, we will need to improve investment levels to support the brands, and we'll also need to optimize the network to establish a profitable and sustainable business model going forward. Change will not happen overnight, but we are building confidence that we can win in soup again.","Turning to our global biscuits and snacks segment. Excluding the benefits of the acquisition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance and the negative impact of currency, organic sales increased 1%, driven by the continued strong performance of Pepperidge Farm, fueled by fresh bakery and Goldfish crackers. This growth was partially offset by softness in our international snacks business.","A year after completing the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, we are making steady progress on the integration of our U.S. snacks businesses, building upon the complementary strengths of Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance. The combined U.S. snacks business delivered strong sales growth across the portfolio with organic sales growing by low to mid-single digits. In the quarter, seven out of our 10 core brands grew or held share.","I continue to be impressed with the proven snacks growth model at Pepperidge Farm. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of organic growth with sales increasing mid single-digit behind strong marketplace performance across all major brands.","A strong proof point to the capability of the team is the turnaround of a tough fresh bakery business as it continued to generate strong growth behind rolls and buns, the Farmhouse brand and the recent restage of our Swirl line where we improved both the product and the packaging. Our cracker business also gained momentum in the quarter, fueled by our largest brand Goldfish. We continue to gain share, driven by base sales growth and the introduction of the new epic crunch line.","Now let's turn to the other half of the U.S. snacks business, the Snyder's-Lance portfolio. Marketplace performance was mixed in the quarter, but is trending upward in the last four weeks, following the activation and increased advertising investments in three of our core brands, Snyder's of Hanover, Kettle and Cape Cod.","We continue to deliver strong performance on late July with consumption increasing by double digits. The snacks team has put in significant work to position these brands for long-term success, including building relevant consumer insights, accelerating ownable renovation, and innovation and increasing brand investments.","The early signs are encouraging as we activated against these Snyder's-Lance brands. We expect performance trends on these brands to continue to improve in the fourth quarter as we deploy needed investment and leverage the best of both playbooks from Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance. We expect to over deliver Snyder's-Lance value capture plans in fiscal 2019 and were on track to deliver against the expected savings of $295 million by the end of fiscal 2022.","The over delivery rate in fiscal '19 is the result of capturing synergies and procurement, specifically in packaging, the consolidation of the sales headquarters and related operations and manufacturing efficiencies.","Beyond the synergies I continue to be pleased with the progress and the pace of the overall integration. The snacks leadership team is created new ways of working, and instilled greater discipline across the combined division. The team is focused on achieving our savings targets, while also accelerating the growth of this key business. We look forward to sharing more details next week on our plans to fully unlock the growth of this advantage and unique snacking portfolio.","Next, on Slide 11, I want to provide a quick update on divestitures. In April, we announced the agreement to divest the Bolthouse Farms business, which is the largest and the final business to be sold of the Campbell fresh segment. We expect the sale to be completed by the end of June. The divestiture process for Campbell international continues to progress, and we are evaluating multiple options with strategic and financial buyers. We remain fully committed to this process. Of course, as we consider all of our options, we will continue to remain disciplined to ensure that we achieve the appropriate value for this iconic business.","With that, let me turn it over to Anthony for a detailed discussion of our financial results.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks Mark. Before getting into the details, I'll make a few comments in our performance this quarter. Overall, we had a good quarter as results exceeded our expectations. We are very pleased with improving trends in our gross margin performance as we benefited from net price realization, continuing productivity improvements and benefits from our cost savings program.","On our cost savings program, we achieved $55 million of savings in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $150 million and the program to-date totaled to $605 million. Cost savings, which are benefiting both continuing and discontinued operations are ahead of our expectations, helping to offset higher transportation and warehousing costs and are one of the factors contributing to the increase in our EPS guidance.","As previously announced, we have an agreement to divest the Bolthouse farms business for $510 million, which we expect to close this month. Together with the completed divestitures of Garden Fresh Gourmet and our U.S. refrigerated soup business, we will have completed the divestiture of our Campbell Fresh segment with anticipated proceeds totaling $565 million. Given this progress, we are now reporting the results of the Campbell Fresh segment as discontinued operations.","Lastly, as we announced this morning, we are updating our 2019 guidance to reflect the classification of Campbell Fresh as a discontinued operation, and raising our full year EPS outlook given our third quarter performance and outlook for the fourth quarter.","I\u2019ll now review our detailed results. I'll primarily discuss the results for continuing operations. However, as we make the reporting transition, we will provide certain metrics combining continuing and discontinued operations to assist many of you who have modeled the business on that basis.","I'll start with continuing operations. For the third quarter, net sales on an as reported basis increased 16% to approximately $2.2 billion, reflecting the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in the global biscuits and snacks segment were offset by a slight decline in meals and beverages.","As previously discussed, we adopted new rules for revenue recognition in the first quarter. While overall, the impact of the accounting change was nominal, it was more impactful within meals and beverages. As we've previously stated, the full year impact of revenue recognition is not expected to be material.","Adjusted EBIT of $316 million declined 2% as a currency neutral 8% decline on the base business was mostly offset by the incremental earnings from the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations declined by 5% or $0.03 to $0.56 per share, primarily due to adjusted EBIT declines in the base business, partly offset by lower adjusted tax rates. In the quarter, the change in revenue recognition had a positive impact of $0.01 per share.","For the first nine months, net sales from continuing operations on an as reported basis increased 24% to $7.1 billion, benefiting from acquisitions, while organic net sales declined 1% compared to the prior year, due primarily to decline in the meals and beverages segment, partly offset by gains in global biscuits and snacks. Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations decreased 1% to $1,134 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.14 was down 13%.","And now on a total combined basis, which includes amount recorded in discontinued operations. Net sales for the quarter increased 12% to 2.4 billion. Adjusted EBIT of $323 million increased 5% and adjusted net EPS declined by 20% or $0.14 to $0.56 per share. For the first nine months, combined net sales increased 21% to $7.8 billion, adjusted EBIT increased 1% to $1,134 billion and adjusted net EPS, which exceeded our expectations of $2.13, was down 19%.","Breaking down our net sales performance from continuing operations for the quarter. Organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as lower volume, primarily in the meals and beverages segment was offset by lower promotional spending. The reduction in promotional spending benefitted net sales by 1 point, reflecting reduce spending in meals and beverages and 30 basis points positive impact from the accounting change on revenue recognition.","There was a 1 point negative impact on net sales from currency translation this quarter. And the addition of Snyder's-Lance to the portfolio added 17 percentage points, bringing our as reported net sales increase to 16%. We've now wrapped the Snyder's-Lance acquisition as of March 26th. And beginning in the fourth quarter, Snyder's-Lance results will be included in our organic results for the full quarter.","As I mentioned, we are pleased with our gross margin progress in the quarter. In continuing operations, while our adjusted gross margin percentage declined 2.1 percentage points in total that includes 1.7 point negative mix impact from the Snyder's lands acquisition. Excluding the diluted impact from the acquisition, our adjusted gross margin percentages declined just 40 basis points. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 350 basis points.","On a rate basis, input prices increased approximately 4%, reflecting higher prices on steel can, vegetables, aluminum and wheat. Going the other way, our ongoing supply chain productivity programs contributed 150 basis points and our cost savings program added an additional 60 basis points of gross margin expansion.","Net pricing contributed 110 basis points as we benefited from reduced trade spending, primarily to meals and beverages and list pricing actions across several key categories. Mix was slightly negative, bringing the gross margin percentage for continuing operations to 33.4%.","At the bottom of the chart, we provided a gross margin bridge for continuing and discontinued operations on a combined basis. Our combined adjusted gross margin, excluding the acquisition impact, expanded by 90 basis points and in aggregate declined just 40 basis points to 31.6%.","Moving on to other operating items. Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 11% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, marketing and selling expenses decreased, driven primarily by lower marketing overhead and selling expenses, including the benefits from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by higher incentive compensation.","Adjusted administrative expenses increased 28% to $151 million, due primarily to higher incentive compensation and the inclusion of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. The incentive compensation headwinds were due to lapping below target accruals in the prior year quarter and improved performance in fiscal 2019.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change from continuing operations between our operating performance and below the line items. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.03 from $0.59 in the prior quarter to $0.56 per share in the current quarter.","On a currency neutral basis, adjusted EBIT had no impact on EPS as an 8% EBIT decline on the base business was offset by the addition of Snyder's-Lance to the portfolio. Adjusted net interest expense increased by $31 million, a $0.07 negative impact to EPS, driven by the increase in the debt level to fund our recent acquisitions and reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates.","Our adjusted EPS benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate, adding $0.05 to EPS. Our adjusted effective tax rate declined 6.5 points to 24.9%, benefiting from lower U.S. federal rate. And lastly, there was a 1% negative impact in EPS from currency translation this quarter, completing the bridge to $0.56 per share.","On this chart, we've also shown the EPS bridge for continuing and discontinued operations combined. On this basis EPS declined from $0.70 to $0.56 as the additional EBIT gains in C-Fresh were more than offset by a significant negative tax impact as the prior year within discontinued operations benefited from an unusually low rate. With adjusted EPS of zero from discontinued operations this quarter, EPS for continuing operations and the combined net EPS are both $0.56.","Now, turning to our segment results. In meals and beverages, organic sales were comparable to the prior year, reflecting mixed results as gains in Canada were offset by declines in the beverages and Prego pasta sauce in the U.S. Segment sales benefited by 1 percentage point from the adoption of new accounting guidance for revenue recognition.","Sales of U.S. soup were comparable to the prior year as gains in broth were offset by declines in condensed and ready to serve soups. Segment operating earnings decline 5% to $207 million. The decline was driven primarily by cost inflation and increased administrative expenses, partly offset by supply-chain productivity gains, lower promotional spending and the benefit of recent list pricing actions.","Here is a look at U.S. veg soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52 week period ending April 28, 2019, the category declined by 2.7%. Our sales in measured channels, including Pacific, declined 5.4%. We had 57.8% market share for the 52 week period, down 160 basis points from the year ago period. Private-label grew share, increasing 130 basis points, primarily reflecting gains in broth brought finishing at 16.6%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 25.6%, increasing 30 basis points.","Although, our share is down for the last 52 weeks, our share trends are improving as shown on the right side of this chart. In global biscuits and snacks, sales were $1,154 billion in the quarter, including an incremental $318 million from Snyder's-Lance through the anniversary of the acquisitions at the end of March.","Excluding the benefit from the acquisition and the negative impact from currency translation, organic sales increased 1%. This performance reflects continued growth in Pepperidge Farm, driven by solid consumption gains in fresh bakery products and Goldfish crackers, partly offset by declines in the international biscuits' and snacks' operating segment.","Overall, sales performance of the Snyder\u2019s-Lance portfolio was in line with our expectations with solid consumption and market share gains for the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Segment operating earnings increased 15% to $139 million, reflecting 21 point benefit from the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, segment operating earnings declined as cost inflation and higher administrative expenses were partly offset by supply chain productivity gains.","Cash from operations for the nine months increased by $124 million to $1,148 billion, reflecting significant improvements in working capital performance, partly offset or lower cash earnings. The cash outlay for capital expenditures was $274 million, $51 million higher than the prior year, reflecting investments to support our cost savings initiatives and the addition of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods to the portfolio. We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $400 million for fiscal 2019.","We paid dividends totaling $318 million compared to $321 million in 2018, reflecting our current quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. Net debt of $9.78 billion declined $570 million compared to the prior year, as positive cash flow generated by the business has been used to reduce debt. We expect to close the divestiture of Bolthouse Farms this month and we'll use the proceeds to further reduce our debt level. And as mentioned, the divestiture process of our international business is ongoing.","I wanted to provide an update on our cost savings program and the impact of the divestiture of Campbell Fresh. We achieved $55 million of incremental savings in the quarter, bringing the program to-date total to $605 million. Campbell Fresh has been a meaningful contributor to our cost savings program, having achieved $70 million to-date and together with future plans for an additional $25 million, comprised $95 million of our previously discussed total program target of $945 million.","Adjusting for Campbell Fresh, our continuing operations have achieved $535 million of savings to-date, and we expect to deliver annualized savings of $850 million by 2022. Going forward, we will present the program for our continuing operations.","We are updating our guidance to reflect our performance, which has exceeded our expectations, as well as a classification of Campbell Fresh as a discontinued operation. For net sales and off an adjusted 2018 base of $7,735 billion, which exclude C-Fresh, sales are now expected to be in the range of $9.75 billion to $9.125 billion. The expected growth rate on sales is slightly higher than the previous guidance as we've removed the diluted sales impact of Campbell Fresh.","For adjusted EBIT, our 2018 base increases from $1,408 billion to $1,433 billion as we now exclude the EBIT loss in discontinued operations. From the new base of $1.433 billion, we expect 2019 adjusted EBIT to be in the range of $1,390 billion to $1,410 billion. As was the case in our previous guidance, this reflects anticipated EBIT declines on our base business, mostly offset by acquisitions.","As shown in the last row, off the unchanged base of $2.87, we now expect adjusted net EPS in the range of $2.50 to $2.55, an increase from our previous range of $2.45 to $2.53. The increased EPS guidance reflects improved operating performance, as well as lower than expected interest costs. The adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.50 to $2.55 also applies to continuing operations as the current year outlook for discontinued operations is nominal.","That completes my review. And now I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Clouse","Thanks, Anthony. After nearly five months at Campbell, I am encouraged by the sequential improvements in our performance, energized about the potential of our great people and brands and confident in the plans we are developing to return this company to profitable sustainable growth over time.","We are already taking tangible actions, but know that we have more work ahead. Our increased focus and discipline is translating into improved results. We will remain pragmatic and transparent about our plans and our progress against our key priorities. We look forward to sharing more of these plans at next week's Investor Day.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken for Q&A.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Mark will be happy to take your questions. Krystal, let's open the lines and take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. The line is open. ","Andrew Lazar","One quick one on organic sales for Anthony and then just a broader one for you, Mark. Anthony, even excluding the revenue recognition benefit in meals and beverages and soup, it still seems that shipments were again ahead of consumption. And I guess thinking ahead to the next quarter, do we expect a reversal of that in fiscal 4Q? Or would you expect soup sales to maybe better correlate with consumption in the quarter? And then more importantly, Mark, I guess I was hoping to ask you to maybe like take stock, if you will, or I guess no pun intended, but in soup season as a whole this past year versus the year before and really how that informs your thinking on this business, going forward, understanding that you're going to give a lot more of the details next week? Thank you.","Mark Clouse","Let me answer that tag team the first part of the question. And I think it\u2019s a little bit varied by category and business. I think relative to inventory position, and as Anthony pointed out in the beginning, the majority of the revenue recognition does land more squarely within the meals and beverage. So there is a distortion there that\u2019s a little bit bigger than the overall 1 point or so that the company experienced.","I do think underpinning that, there is probably about points of inventory as we finished through the month of April and through Easter where the sequence of the timing was really very close to the end of the quarter. As we look tough, the good news is we see May, and I think the latest four-week information will come after shortly. We're seeing very strong performance across the meals and beverages business as we kind get back into good relationships with several of our retailers we are starting to support the business.","And so I'm feeling pretty good that as we think about the fourth quarter for that business that it will be more or less in line with consumption. It's possible as we watch inventory fluctuations that there may be a point in there that could be a negative headwind as we go through the quarter. But I think if we can continue to maintain some momentum on the businesses that will serve us well going through the quarter and then starting 2020 in a strong position. Did I miss anything, Anthony?","Anthony DiSilvestro","No, I would just add, overall, when you guys do the math for the implied Q4 sales performance and back out the impact of the acquisition, you'll see the base business is expected to decline for the full year minus 2% to minus 1%. And that includes a 1 point negative impact due to currency. So the organic performance for the full year minus 1 to flat and that implies fourth quarter of minus 1% to plus 1%. So something around neutral is our expectation overall for the fourth quarter.","And then on the soup season, I guess what I would say is, I call it a healthy education, on both some positive and some probably further realization of what it's going to take to really support the business properly, going forward. I think on the good news side of it, we definitely did see improvement in areas where we were deploying support.","So if you think about the support on condensed, specifically around cooking, if you think about the support that was in place around the launch of some of the sipping soups around the Well Yes! brand and also some of the return to advertising support of Chunky, all of those businesses moderated their trends, but they didn\u2019t swing to the positive or neutral area. And certainly, continuing to lose share is not the objective going forward for those businesses.","So although, I think we were able to moderate and see some impact, I do think it continues to speak to the need for a broader, more holistic strategy, as I've talked about before, with perhaps stronger calls to action on differentiation beyond just the pricing and promotion. But I would say we did do a good job of level-setting through the season.","So I think I would describe it as some encouragement in that there is a response to the support we're doing, but also reinforcement that as we talk about the soup plan next week, the comprehensive nature of it and the need to do a variety of different things across both products, packaging, pricing and support ongoing, along with a complimentary funnel of innovation is going to be I think the key to really repositioning or changing the trajectory of the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","So just two from me, one, Anthony, I might have missed it. But I just wanted to touch on whether you've updated all the outlook for commodity costs, or cost of goods inflation for this year? And if there's anything we should think about in context to what's happened with tariffs, or potential tariffs with Mexico? And then, Mark, just a broader one from me on snacking. There's been some, I guess some stories suggesting maybe you\u2019re thinking a little bit more about portfolio within the snacks business domestically, the potential to maybe divest a brand or two. So I just wanted to see if there's any comment or update on just your thoughts about the domestic portfolio.","Anthony DiSilvestro","So in terms of the commodity inflation, as I said in my comments, cost inflation was about 4% for the third quarter, which is a little less than the first half and, and probably should run through about that rate for the fourth quarter, although, we're seeing some moderation in several categories. In terms of tariffs, there's some obviously lot of activity on that front. The news with respect to Canada, it's going to help us a little bit. Some of our steel is sourced from Canada, not the majority, the minority, so that have a marginal and favorable impact. And the avoidance of any retaliatory tariffs with respect to Canada will avoid fairly significant cost for us. It's not in our base but would have impacted next year. So that goes away. And then the recent discussions around Mexico could have, I would say, a fairly nominal impact on our cost input.","Mark Clouse","A little bit of a moving target right now on tariffs for sure. Bryan, on the question around the domestic snack portfolio, as you would imagine, other than things we publicly announced, I wouldn't spend a lot of time speculating on M&A activity or talking about that. What I will say is I think the priority for us is clear. We're very focused on the divestitures that we discussed and I'm feeling very good about the progress that we've made to successfully sell the Campbell Fresh portfolio. I also remain very committed to the process on the international side of the business. And I think that's our top priority right now.","Of course, as we continue to look forward, we're going to want to make sure that we continue to understand what brands and what the strongest portfolio is for us as we continue to believe that there's just tremendous potential to compete and to win in snacking with the portfolio that we have. But as always, I want to make sure that we've got the right brands that have the best strategic potential, while also recognizing that just continuing to shrink the business or shrinking our way to greatness is not going to be the right strategy either.","And I think as we move through these, we haven't talked a lot about M&A strategy. We'll talk about that a little bit next week. But I think I would describe it in sequence. Let's take care of the ones that are on the table now. And then we'll move to continuing to think about how do we strengthen the portfolio after.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ken Goldman","Mark, in your prepared remarks, you talked about potential to optimize your network. And it's something you mentioned last quarter as well. I realize you don't want to necessarily get ahead of the Analyst Day. But can you help us understand a little bit what this means from a practical sense? I guess I'm asking if you're considering consolidating some of your DSP routes, and how difficult that might be. And just trying to get a little bit of help in that direction. Thank you.","Mark Clouse","Honestly, when I'm talking about network I\u2019m talking more about the manufacturing footprint. A little bit on warehousing and logistics as well. And I think, it's not an unexpected position to be in after a variety of acquisitions and divestitures over the last several years. For us now take a step back and go okay, we're pretty clear now on what we expect this business to look like. We've got a fairly comprehensive strategic plan that's inclusive of at least the early reads of our pipelines for innovation. And we need to cast that now against the footprint that we have from both a manufacturing and a logistics and warehousing network, and see if there's not opportunities to better optimize that or match that with the combined businesses that we have today.","And I think as we're doing that, we're seeing opportunity to improve that. And again, I think it's a good moment in time for us to tackle it. But as far as the snacks integration go, our focus on that has really been in the DSP headquarters and operations area where there is a significant opportunity that we're now about a quarter and a half of our way through.","And it's going very well and it helps you on a variety of fronts, cost one, but also in bringing the best of both to bear and how we're directing and utilizing our DSP platform, which we continue to believe and see is a very strong competitive advantage within the world of snacking.","Ken Goldman","And then maybe that\u2019s a good lead into my second question, which is you've talked about synergies and packaging and some of the consolidation of the headquarters is really leading up for savings this year so far. There's still a lot left to go in the savings plan. Mark or Anthony, could you walk us through a little bit with some of the bigger buckets are that you see are left and maybe some of the timing of those if you can, right now? I don\u2019t want to, again, get too far ahead of the Analyst Day.","Anthony DiSilvestro","This is something I'm going to talk a lot about next week. But certainly, there's a lot to go within Snyder's-Lance value capture across the areas that Mark talks about, and including manufacturing and administrative costs. And then on our base program, we're also working on some network optimization areas. Now, we previously announced shutdown of our Toronto manufacturing location, that's coming up right now. And we also have some organizational work that we're doing as well. So we're very confident that we have a detailed plan to get to the $315 million of cost savings still to go. And we'll talk a lot more about that next week.","Mark Clouse","I think, Ken, if you think about the integration, in particular, I think the combination of where you would normally see procurements, manufacturing, administrative costs. I think there is also going to be and as we'll talk about more next week. There is an opportunity as these businesses come together to drive, what I would call, some outsized efficiencies in our ability to improve overall operating effectiveness and efficiency of the Snyder\u2019s-Lance business as it comes into the Pepperidge Farm and combines and scales in a very different way than we were before.","So I think you will see a little bit more of that for detail as we go through next week to give you a bit better understanding of contribution of those building blocks, which I think is one of the bigger questions that will help I think people get more comfortable with our ability to deliver on those commitments.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi. Your line is now open.","David Driscoll","Just a couple of follow ups, and then actually all three might be follow ups here. The first one just on your outlook. I\u2019m slightly confused. Did you make changes to your expectations for Simple Meals and Global Snacking? On just my first look on this is looks like C-Fresh is certainly outperforming. But I really want to understand if this critical guidance range is because of more favorable expectations in Simple Meals and Global Snacking.","Anthony DiSilvestro","I think the best way to think about is to look at the EBIT guidance before and now, and think about the midpoint, so the midpoint going from 13.90 after $1.4 billion. All of that improvement fits inside of our continuing operation, both meals and beverages and snacks. And that\u2019s because our outlook for 2019 for C-Fresh is basically neutral. So that entire improvement is the base business. So that\u2019s worth of that $0.02 to $0.03 at EPS. The balance of the improvement is coming from lower than anticipated interest expense. So previously we talked about a range of $3.75 to $3.90. We're now expecting to see around $3.70. So that\u2019s another $0.02 to $0.03 of improvement. And those two things explain the improvement in our EPS outlook, the midpoint going from $2.49 to $2.53.","David Driscoll","And following on the tariff question, you made a reference that you wouldn\u2019t have or you think if you won't have a headwind on the products that you sell in Canada. Can you give few numbers to that so that I can just be clear on what's your trying to get at, numerically? What would you expect -- what was the expected headwind from Canadian tariffs? And I think what you are saying is you now think that you will now experience base Canadian tariff headwinds on your products. Just clean that up slightly. And the last question to you guys is a follow up on these cost savings. As Ken was saying, this is a really big number. So Mark I just like to hear from you on just your confidence in the $315 million in future savings? And then do you still expect half of that to be reinvested? Thanks guys.","A - Anthony DiSilvestro","So I will start with expected tariffs, there are a couple of moving parts. What I was referring to earlier on the Canadian tariffs on steel imports from Canada to the U.S., we source some of our steel that\u2019s used in our cans from Canada. That has gone away. That had a slightly positive impact relative to where we've been. Obviously, it doesn\u2019t elevate all the tariff issue we have inside of our steel can cost but part of it.","The other part is the retaliatory tariffs on soup exports from the U.S. to Canada. If enacted, that would have had approximately about $20 million negative impact. So that's an avoided cost for us. And then the third part I was referring to was we sort some ingredients and packaging items from Mexico for our U.S. business, not a lot. And that could have probably, I would say, $2 million $4 million potential impact.","Mark Clouse","And then on the costs savings, I mean, David, it'll be easier to do this when we're together next week, and be able to give you building blocks as you go. But I do think we have built a very strong bridge relative to where the sources of savings are going to come from. And I also think this is a business that although we certainly would acknowledge that there are a variety of things we've got to improve performance wise, our ability to deliver the savings historically is a pretty strong track record.","And I think we'll try to bring through what were the sources of the savings so far and then where are the big drill sites as we continue to go forward. But we've talked about a couple of them today and certainly, we've talked a bit about the Snyder's-Lance value capture, which is a material component, but also the broader network optimization work that we're doing also, some of the underlining organizational elements that we'll talk a bit more about next week. All of these are contributing factors that will build a bridge to it.","As far as how we're going to utilize it, there's no question that that I know is something that folks would like to understand relative to investment and what's it going to take. When we talk about winning and soup and some of the other areas where we believe we can strengthen our investment model, we're going to try to give a lot more clarity to that as well. But certainly, what I'm pleased about is we've contemplated the savings plan. Certainly, even prior to my arrival, there was a strong understanding and expectation that investment was going to be needed on our businesses.","And so it was contemplated in the algorithm that was put together, of course, pacing is what we'll talk a bit more about next week as well. But I do think there's a meaningful investment that will come from that source of savings. But I believe that also has been contemplated in the financial framework that we've talked about in the past. And so we'll try to give you the building blocks in the sequence to feel better about understanding how those things work together to get to the outcomes that we'll discuss next week.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English","A couple of questions, first real quick housekeeping item. You're showing EBIT for C-Fresh of $25 million loss in the prior year base, I think you had reported $43 million. Is it fair to say that that $18 million delta is the stranded cost, maybe the corporate cost allocation that's falling back into the base business?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, that's correct.","Jason English","And then a question on pricing. The positive price promo in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages was certainly an upside surprise versus our expectation. And I understand there is some revenue recognition noise in there. But even stripping that out its better than we would have expected, you mentioned some fresh price increases in trade promo reduction. Can you give us some context around where and what magnitude the list price increases have been implemented. And just more holistically, your broader thought process around the durability and sustainability of the pricing architecture within Simple Meals and Beverages?","Mark Clouse","So Jason, as you might imagine on that portfolio, there are some puts and takes. And there are some places where we're making -- where we continue to see the need and are investing in price on certain businesses, while also there are places where we've gone in and been able to rationalize what I would call less effective investment and price. If you think back to a year ago in this quarter, we had quite a bit of activity going around retail relationships and some challenges that we had in different places.","And in response to that some investments and some spending promotionally that in hindsight as you look back now on it probably didn't have the ROI that we would expect or at the level that that we would want it to be. So there have been some places where we've been able to rationalize what I'd call less efficient spending, while continuing to deploy some resources in the places where we need it.","As we go forward, I think our approach on this is going to be quite the balanced where we're going to see brands and particular parts of our portfolio, where I think we need to continue to be a bit more aggressive to really manage price gaps strategically, while in other places, I think there are opportunities for us perhaps to strengthen the value side of the equation, either through product, marketing or shifting mix through more margin-accretive innovation as a way to help. Also price-size architecture as a tool for us going forward, I think is going to help us.","I would not expect pricing just in the environment we're in and where the state of the business is to be a substantial contributor to the margin or the business going forward. But I do think as we saw in this quarter, the idea that is able to balance and moderate from where it had been a more substantial headwind in the first part of the year, I do think is not an impractical assumption.","And again I think, we'll talk a little bit about the business in more details on where some of those price gaps are a bit more, I think, in need of support, while a couple of places where I think we need to do more of the job and more of the heavy lifting on really strengthening our product, marketing and support.","Jason English","And the list price increases you enacted, where were they?","Mark Clouse","I mean we were -- it was a very limited list of list prices\u2026","Anthony DiSilvestro","It was some in soup, it was some in\u2026","Mark Clouse","Little bit in soup where we had strong commodity related cost increases is where we took it. So not a broad scale list price increase but some selective pricing, which again I think in this environment being able to even get it on a selective basis in the portfolio is a good positive statement.","Anthony DiSilvestro","In the segment results there are some list pricing actions we took in Canada, as well as in our food service business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Growe","I just had a quick follow-up question to Jason's and then a second question. And again, I'm sure you'll have more to say on this next week at your Investor Meeting. But just understand on soup, the business improved sequentially in the quarter even though it's still down on sales. But can you attribute that to I think one of things you talked about earlier was the response to some of the marketing and promotion programs for the business. Would you attribute to that? In the meantime, we've seen price gaps expand and condensed. Does that get to where areas where you meant to settle it more to try and get price gets adjusted as you were just discussing in that answer?","Mark Clouse","I think, that's right. If you look in the quarter, a couple of things that stand out in soup. So first, let's just set the context, again, first half of the year -- and I'll talk to in-markets, because we've talked a little bit about the noise below consumption that's translating into a little better net sales number in the quarter than the end-market. But we essentially moved from the first half of the year where we were declining in market at about 6%, I think 5.5% in that range to just under [Technical Difficulty] declining about 6% that decline reduced to about 2%.","And again, I think part of this is being driven by the reorientation to some support selectively around the cooking business, and the ability to drive some relevance in occasions beyond just soup eating, but also some of the usage strategy around it. So that's one of the areas that I think is encouraging. I think the second area is the Well Yes! business and the launch of the sippable format. That has been and continues to be strong evidence, albeit a relatively small scale right now, but the opportunity for that to bring new consumers into the brands and into the aisle is very encouraging. And as you might imagine, I think our ability to scale that up going forward is going to be important.","And then I think you have great momentum from the category standpoint on broth. And I think our ability to use our leadership position and strengthen the differentiation, while making sure our price gaps are right, which is probably an area where we've got some work to do is another encouraging baseline but with an opportunity to do more as we go forward. And I already talked a little about chunky, which again I certainly wouldn't call it bright, but decent response to some of the things that we've done. And so I think those were the areas in the quarter that you can bridge, if you will, what changed from the first half to the third quarter.","Now I think we build upon those learnings as we start to fuel what the 2020 soup season will look like and how do we bring to bear all of those learnings, both positively and negatively, to try to get the right plan in place so that we can validate some of this ability to strengthen the trajectory.","Chris Growe","Okay, that was a helpful discussion there. Thank you for that. Just a quick follow-up for Anthony. You gave some initial dilution around, I should say initial EPS dilution, you expected due to divestitures. Has that changed at all this point? You have obviously what you experienced or will experience on Campbell Fresh, you still have international still to go. I think it's like $0.03 to $0.05 dilution factor. Is that still in place then today?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I think we thought it'll be -- given all the changes in the reporting here, a little bit confusing now to do that pro forma, because C-Fresh is already out and the accretion from that C-Fresh divestiture, if you look at 2018 or $0.03 of operations, you could add another $0.04 or the interest benefit, so you get to $0.07, that's a little bit lower in 2019, because of the operating performance of C-Fresh is better. So the EBIT within discontinued operations should be fairly nominal. And then you get the interest benefit coming through. We don't want to get too specific on the international business at this point, given where we are with that process. But as soon as we announce something, we can talk certainly about the dilutive impact of that divestiture.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you again.","Operator","Thank you. And in the interest of time, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's call. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."],"4410":["Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) Q2 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call February 16, 2018  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Ken Gosnell - VP, Finance, Strategy and IR","Denise Morrison - President and CEO","Anthony DiSilvestro - CFO","Analysts","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","David Driscoll - Citi Research","Ken Goldman - JP Morgan","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Chris Growe - Stifel","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Campbell Soup Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ken Gosnell, Vice President, Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ken Gosnell","Thank you, Candice. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the second quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup\u2019s fiscal 2018.","With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO. As usual, we\u2019ve created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in a listen-only mode.","Today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.","And one final item before we begin our discussion of the quarter. I would like to cordially invite our interested shareholders, investors, members of the media and consumer to listen to and view our investor presentation at CAGNY which will be video webcast live on Wednesday, February 21 at 11 a.m. eastern time. A replay of the video and copies of the materials will also be available afterwards on our Web site. If you are attending the event, there will be a Campbell sponsored lunch immediately after our presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Denise.","Denise Morrison","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Today we will discuss our results in the quarter and our updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. I will also detail the actions we are taking to improve our execution and performance in the second half of this year while advancing the long-term transformation of Campbell in response to changing consumer and retailer dynamics.","This was a difficult quarter for the company. Our performance was below our expectations. Organic sales declined 2% driven primarily by ongoing disappointing results in U.S. soup and Campbell Fresh. Adjusted EBIT decreased 4%. I will provide a brief overview now and additional details when I share my perspective on our segment performance in a moment.","Soup sales declined 7% in the quarter, modestly below what we expected. The issue with the key customer which we last discussed with you in November, continued to negatively impact our U.S. soup sales this quarter. I am encouraged that we are engaging in ongoing discussions with this key customer and making progress. The anticipated improvements in Campbell Fresh's performance did not materialize as we expected with sales declining 1%. While we are making progress in addressing several execution issues, we face new challenges in the quarter with headwinds in the super premium juice segment. Additionally, the carrot yield issue we discussed last quarter extended into the second quarter.","The decline in adjusted EBIT reflected the performance of U.S. soup, cost of carrot increases in C Fresh and significantly higher transportation and logistics cost which are impacting all of our U.S. businesses. While we initially expected transportation cost to moderate throughout the year, the challenges have proved more persistent than originally anticipated and we now expect it to continue to impact the business for the reminder of the year.","This morning we updated our fiscal 2018 guidance, reflecting our outlook for the reminder of the fiscal year. The completion of the Pacific Foods acquisition and the impact of the recently enacted tax reform legislation. We intend to use future proceeds from the lower tax rate to invest in innovation, particularly in health and well being and snacking, and to accelerate our ecommerce activities. Anthony will take you through the details of our updated guidance in a few minutes.","Finally, I want to touch on the status of our multiyear cost savings program. We continue to deliver meaningful savings and I am pleased to say we have identified additional opportunities that have enabled us to increase our savings target from $450 million to $500 million by the end of fiscal 2020. Now let's talk about our performance across our divisions. Let's start with Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. Sales and operating earnings both declined in the quarter. The decline in the top line was driven primarily by the performance of U.S. soup and V8 beverages.","U.S. soup sales declined 7%, an improvement from the first quarter of the fiscal year but still slightly below our expectations for this quarter. Nearly all of the decline was a result of the key customer issue referenced earlier. We have kept an open and positive dialog with this customer and are making progress. I recognize that you likely have many questions about soup but I know that you understand that we don\u2019t discuss details about specific customers. What I can tell you is that based on recent developments, we now expect sales declines in soup to moderate in the second half.","In the balance of the marketplace we delivered better performance in soup as our program was well received and consumer takeaway was up slightly. In particular, the Well Yes! and Slow Kettle lines continue to perform well. We are pleased to have completed the acquisition of Pacific Foods in the quarter and we are moving quickly to integrate the finance, supply chain, and quality functions. Pacific complements our portfolio by adding a differentiated brand with organic and functional attribute in soup, broth, and plant based beverages that appeal to consumers seeking health and well being benefits.","Turning to beverages. Our V8 portfolio remained challenged and sales of V8 declined in the quarter. The shelf stable beverage category continues to face headwinds. Despite the overall sales decline, we continue to see positive consumption trends in V8 + Energy. We are focused on reinvigorating the brand with innovation that connects our vegetable nutrition equities with the functional benefits consumers are seeking, focusing on our profitable V8 original and V8 + Energy lines.","Now let's turn to Campbell Fresh. In the quarter, sales declined 1% and we recorded a loss of $11 million. This performance was below our expectations. As I mentioned at the outset, the C Fresh team has made progress in overcoming several of its operational challenges. Namely, we have improved beverage and carrot quality, addressed capacity constraints in beverages and returned the CPG business to competitive promotional levels. However, our progress was slowed in the quarter by new challenges in the super premium juice segment as we continue to experience higher carrot cost due to the yield issues we discussed last year.","Let's start with beverages. The headwinds in the super premium juice segment are multi-faceted. We believe the primary drivers concerns about sugar and consumers migrating to functional beverages that deliver benefits such as protein, gut health, energy and hydration. Several customers recently reset their premium juice category reducing space in the super premium segment. Because of these resets and our previous supply constraints, Bolthouse Farms lost some shelf space which hurt beverage sales in the quarter.","To address this, we are launching our most robust beverage innovation line in two years. Our upcoming beverage innovation suite is designed to address the sugar issue and evolve our beverage portfolio to be in-step with consumer preferences. We believe it will begin to rejuvenate the super premium segment by introducing functional benefits at an affordable price point, as well as expand our footprint in the ultra-premium segment. We are launching 19 beverages SKUs this spring compared to just three a year ago. Notably, we just started shipping the new Bolthouse Farms B Line which consists of 8 varieties. B Strong and B Balanced delivers great taste, functional benefits and reduced sugar. B Strong is a protein drink with 70% less sugar than other leading brands and B Balanced smoothies contains 50% less sugar than other brands.","The B Line has been well received by customers as it meets the consumer preferences for reduced sugar and functional benefits. Additionally, we are building on the initial success of our alternative dairy drink, Bolthouse Farms plant protein milk, by expanding our plant based offerings in the ultra-premium segment with three new protein varieties of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms. We expect our spring beverage innovations will drive improved performance in the second half. Now an update on farms.","While sales of carrot and carrot ingredients increased 3% in the quarter, the yield issue we experienced earlier in the year extended into the second quarter. As we discussed in November, our carrot crops were negatively impacted by adverse weather which resulted in extremely low yields and caused us to place customers on allocation. We came off allocation in December as planned but the lingering effect of this issue drove higher carrot cost and impacted profit in the second quarter.","In the back half, our plans called for improved performance in Campbell Fresh. In support of our beverage innovation, we will launch new marketing and promotional campaigns to improve CPG performance. We also remain focused on executing our quality strategy in carrots and delivering supply chain productivity improvements. At the highest level, we know that consumer preferences for fresh and healthier food continues to be strong and we remain confident in the growth potential of the package fresh categories. We are focused on improving our execution and returning C Fresh to profitable growth.","Finally, our global biscuits and snacks division. This division continues to deliver consistent performance, especially Pepperidge Farm. In the quarter sales growth was primarily driven by the continued solid performance of Pepperidge Farm and gains in Kelsen in China. In Pepperidge Farm I am pleased with the top line performance of snacks, where both crackers and cookies contributed to gains and grew share in the quarter. Our cracker portfolio outpaced the category behind continued strong performance from the Goldfish brand. And in our cookie portfolio, the Farmhouse line which delivers great taste with simple recognizable ingredients, continued to perform well.","Outside the U.S., Kelsen delivered solid performance in China. I am encouraged with the progress we have made in becoming a more consumer focused operation and improving our logistics, supply chain and the management of our expanded distribution network. This quarter we had a strong sell-in for Chinese New Year and our distributors delivered well executed, merchandizing programs leading up to the holiday, which is being celebrated today. The division's operating earnings were impacted by rising inflation, particularly significantly higher prices for butter, which we are addressing through pricing actions and supply chain productivity improvements.","Overall, I feel good about our performance in global biscuits and snacks and I am confident that this team will continue to drive our core business while integrating Snyder's Lance into Campbell. We now expect to complete the Snyder's Lance transaction by the end of the first calendar quarter. In closing, this was a difficult quarter and I am not satisfied with our performance. We are continuing to take actions to improve our execution and expect better results in the second half. We have made progress with our key customer around soup and we now expect sales declines in soup to moderate in the second half.","We have plans in place to combat the headwinds in the super premium beverage category segment and expand our presence in the ultra premium segment of the market. We expect our robust beverage innovation and marketing to lead to improved performance in the back half for Campbell Fresh. We are driving continued momentum in global biscuits and snacks with strong performance in Pepperidge Farm. We are moving quickly to integrate Pacific Foods into Campbell. We are successfully executing our cost savings program and have identified new savings opportunities and we are making the necessary investments to drive growth, including accelerating our ecommerce efforts with increased levels of activity and investing in long-term disruptive innovation.","Despite challenges in the quarter, we have made significant progress towards our long-term strategy to transform Campbell's portfolio in the faster growing spaces of health and well being and snacking. In particular, the pending Snyder's Lance acquisition will be the largest acquisition in our history. Snacking is a category we know extremely well and the acquisition complements Pepperidge Farm which has been one of our best long-term performing businesses. We are confident that the Snyder's Lance acquisition will deliver significant shareholder value.","Campbell will look all together different once we complete this transaction. The addition of Snyder's Lance will have a transformational impact on Campbell, adding $2.2 billion in annual net sales. As a result, snacking will represent approximately 46% of our total company net sales. We are acting with urgency to transform Campbell, I am confident that the steps we are taking will gain traction and lead to improved performance. I look forward to answering your questions in a few moments and to seeing many of you at CAGNY next week, where we will share additional information on our strategic transformation. But first, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and revised 2018 guidance.","Our challenge in the quarter was our gross margin performance as the percentage declined by about 2 points compared to last year. Gross margin performance was pressured by cost inflation, primarily butter prices as well as higher transportation and logistics cost which did not moderate as expected and higher carrot and manufacturing cost in Campbell Fresh. Reflecting this performance and lower expectations going forward for C Fresh, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge on the carrot and carrot ingredient business.","On the positive side, we continue to make progress on our multiyear cost savings programs. We generated $20 million of savings in the quarter, bringing the program to date total to $365 million. We now expect to deliver $75 million to $85 million in 2018. Based on our success to date, and additional opportunities identified, we had increased our 2020 target to $500 million, a $50 million increase. We are benefitting from the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. The lower ongoing tax rate is benefiting Q2 EPS by $0.12 and adding $0.25 to the full year adjusted EPS forecast as we lower our expected adjusted effective tax rate to approximately 26%.","We are updating our full year guidance to reflect lower expectations for gross margin performance on the base business. The addition of Pacific Foods to the portfolio and the impact of U.S. tax reforms. Now I will review our results in more detail. For the second quarter, net sales on as reported basis were comparable to the prior year at $2,180 million. Excluding a one point benefit from the acquisition of specific foods and a one point benefit from currency translation, organic net sales declined 2% driven primarily by lower volumes in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages.","Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter declined 4% to $402 million, reflecting a lower adjusted gross margin percentage, partly offset by an increase in adjusted other income and lower marketing and selling expenses. Reflecting a lower adjusted effective tax rate attributable to tax reform, adjusted EPS increased 10% or $0.09 to $1 per share. For the first half, as reported net sales declined 1% and organic net sales declined by 2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT decreased 10% to $819 million and adjusted EPS was up $1.91, was down 1%.","Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Organic net sales declined 2% driven by lower volume, reflecting declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, driven primarily by U.S. soup and V8 beverages. Overall, promotional spending rates were comparable to the prior year. There was a positive impact from currency translation of 1%, principally the Australian and Canadian dollar. There was also a 1% increase as a result of the recent Pacific Foods acquisition which closed in December, bringing our as reported sales to year ago level.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased 220 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 330 basis points. The majority of this was cost inflation which on a rate basis increased about 3.5% reflecting higher prices on dairy, meat, steel cans and aluminum. The reminder was driven by higher transportation and logistics cost, cost associated with our Real food initiative and higher carrot and manufacturing cost in Campbell Fresh. These negative drivers were partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiatives.","Mix had a negative impact of 60 basis points primarily due to the impact of the Pacific Foods acquisition, including the purchase accounting impact and negative mix from the sales decline in U.S. soup. Pricing has a positive impact of 20 basis points, driven by pricing on our Kelsen business as we partly recover significant cost increases on butter. Promotional spending also had a positive impact of 20 basis points in the quarter, primarily reflecting reduction of inefficient promotional spending on the Arnott\u2019s business.","Lastly, our supply chain productivity program, which is incremental to our cost savings program contributed 130 basis points of margin improvement. All in, our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased 220 basis points to 35.2%. Marketing and selling expenses declined 5% in the quarter, reflecting lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses and the benefits from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by investments in ecommerce. The majority of the reduction in advertising and consumer promotion spending, reflects the timing shift on Kelsen from the second quarter into the third quarter to support the later timing of the Chinese New Year.","Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 1% to $139 million. For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line item. Adjusted EPS increased $0.09 from $0.91 in the prior year quarter to $1 per share in the current quarter. On a currency neutral basis, the decline in adjusted EBIT had a negative $0.04 impact on EPS, primarily driven by our gross margin performance, partly offset by an increase in adjusted other income and lower marketing and selling expenses.","Net interest expense was up $4 million, a $0.01 negative impact to EPS, reflecting higher rates and an increase in the debt level associated with the acquisition of Pacific Foods. Our adjusted EPS results are benefitting from the ongoing benefit of U.S. tax reform. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter including a year to date true up, declined by about 9 percentage points to 18.9%. The lower adjusted tax rate in the quarter increased EPS by $0.11, including a $0.12 per share impact from U.S. tax reforms. Benefitting from share repurchases, the lower share count added a $0.02 benefit to EPS. And lastly, although currency translation was slightly favorable, it has no impact on EPS completing the bridge to $1 per share.","Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales declined 4%, driven primarily by declines in U.S. soup and V8 beverages, partly offset by gains in our retail business in Canada. Excluding the benefit of the acquisition of Pacific Foods, sales of U.S. soup declined 7%, driven by declines in ready to serve and condensed soups. Broth sales were comparable to a year ago. As previously discussed U.S. soup sales were negatively impacted by reduced support levels with a key customer. As Denise mentioned, we are making progress and expect improved sales trends in the back half.","Dollar consumption of soup in measured channels declined by 3%. The difference between consume takeaway and our sales is primarily due to higher retail sales prices. Changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact our soup sales performance in the quarter. Segment operating earnings decreased 9% in the quarter to $282 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage and lower sales volumes, partly offset by lowering marketing and selling expenses.","Segment gross margin performance was impacted by higher transportation and logistics cost as well as negative mix related to the acquisition of Pacific Foods and lower organic soup sales. Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52 week period ending January 28, 2018, the category as a whole increased 80 basis points. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.2%. Including Pacific, on a pro forma basis, we had a 60% market share for the 52 week period, down 120 basis points from the year ago period.","Private label grew share by 130 basis points, reflecting gains in broth, finishing at 14.9%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 25.1%, decreasing 10 basis points. In global biscuits and snacks, organic sales increased 3%, driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm snacks, reflecting continued momentum in Goldfish crackers and double digit gains in cookies and also from gains on Kelsen cookies in China in advance of the Chinese New Year. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, sales of Arnott's biscuits were comparable to the prior year.","Segment operating earnings increased 1% to $139 million. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, operating earnings were comparable to the prior year with lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, offset by a lower gross margin percentage, reflecting higher levels of cost inflation, particularly on butter.","In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales declined 1% to $257 million, driven primarily by sales declines in Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages. Segment operating earnings in the quarter declined from a loss of $3 million to a loss of $11 million, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage, driven by higher supply chain cost, as well as higher carrot cost attributable to adverse weather earlier in the fiscal year. Within this segment, the performance of the carrot and carrot ingredient business, was below our expectations. We have lowered our future projections for the carrot business and in our reported results recorded a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill.","Cash from operations declined slightly to $660 million compared to $667 million in 2017 as higher hedging related payment were mostly offset by improved working capital performance. Capital expenditures were $132 million, $13 million higher than the prior year. We paid dividends totaling $216 million compared to $207 million in 2017, reflecting the 12% increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced in September of fiscal 2017. In aggregate, we repurchased $86 million of shares on a year-to-date basis, $75 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity based compensation.","With the pending acquisition of Snyder's Lance, we have now suspended our share repurchases. Net debt of $3.7 billion is up from $3.2 billion a year ago as the impact of the Pacific Foods acquisition debt was partly offset by positive cash flow on the base business. Now I will review our revised 2018 guidance.","As shown, we have isolated changes in our base business from the impact of the Pacific Foods acquisition and tax reforms. We now expect sales to change by minus 1% to plus 1%. This includes a 1 point benefit from the Pacific Foods acquisition that was completed in December 2017. The sales outlook on the base business remains unchanged from our previous guidance. Primarily due to lower expectations for gross margin performance which I will discuss in a moment, we now expect adjusted EBIT to decline by minus 7% to minus 5%, including a one point negative impact from Pacific Foods.","As previously disclosed, we expect that the Pacific Foods acquisition will negatively impact EPS by $0.05 in fiscal 2018. We also expect the ongoing rate benefit of U.S. tax reform to have a positive impact on adjusted EPS of approximately $0.25 in fiscal 2018, reflecting an adjusted tax rate of approximately 26%. All in, we now expect adjusted EPS to increase by 2% to 4%. As we will discuss next week at CAGNY, we expect to utilize a portion, potentially a majority of the tax reform benefits to accelerate our investments in the P&L in fiscal 2019. In our next earnings call, we will update our guidance to include the impact of the Snyder's Lance acquisition on the balance of our fiscal year.","Given the changes to our outlook, I will wrap up with a recap of the key assumptions. We have seen an uptick in cost inflation and now forecast and inflation rate of approximately 3%. In addition, our supply chain costs are being impacted by higher transportation and logistics cost and increased carrot and manufacturing cost in C Fresh. We continue to expect ongoing supply chain productivity gain, excluding the benefit of our cost savings program of approximately 3% across the products sold. And against our cost savings program, we now expect to deliver $75 million to $85 million of cost savings most of which will impact cost.","With higher than anticipated cost inflation and other supply chain cost, as well as our expectation for more normal soup promotional spending in the back half and the acquisition of Pacific Foods, partly offset by increased cost savings, we expect our adjusted gross margins to decline about 1 percentage point. Below the line, our interest expense is now expected to increase to a range of $135 million to $140 million, reflecting higher interest rates and increased debt to fund the acquisition of Pacific Foods.","Reflecting the benefit of tax reform we expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 26%, and because of the acquisition of Pacific Foods and the pending acquisition of Snyder's Lance, share purchases after completing $86 million year-to-date, are now on hold. This guidance assumes that the impact of currency translation will be slightly positive.","Lastly, we are forecasting capital expenditures of approximately $425 million, which is an increase from the previous outlook, reflecting recently initiated projects under our cost savings programs and spending for Pacific Foods. That concludes my remarks, now I will turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Anthony. We will now start the Q&A session. Since we have limited time, out of fairness to the other callers, please ask only one question at a time. Okay, Candice?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bryan Spillane","So I guess bigger question. You have got the tax savings which you are going to reinvest a portion of even in the 2019. While at the same time, you know there is -- you are going through some cost savings. Can you kind of talk about sort of the incremental need to invest now? How much of that is driven by like the commodity inflation? How much of it is being driven by just how rapidly things are changing, I guess, in the retail environment but it's a pretty material step up in investment and I am trying to understand sort of what's changed to drive that investment. And maybe second, if you can give a little bit of comment on expected return. At what time frame could we expect that that incremental investment will begin to kind of result in an acceleration in sales and earnings?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. So I will take a crack at that. You know as we look at our business and we are right in the middle of our planning process now for next fiscal year and I think we have mentioned before the areas that we need to reinvest in along the lines of building capability in digital and ecommerce, supporting our brands and launching new products. Investing in longer term innovation, things like Habit, and some other ventures that we have underway. And as we go through that and see the [indiscernible] of the tax reform coming, we really do see an opportunity to accelerate those investment to position the company for long term growth.","We are still working through some of the details on that and we will have more to say I think when we get to our 2019 guidance. But we will talk about this next week. We really see 2019 as a transition year for us. We need to do a couple of things. We need to stabilize U.S. soup, we need to turn around our Campbell Fresh business, we need to make these investments to drive long-term growth, we need to add Pacific Foods and integrate Snyder's Lance into the portfolio and I think as you look beyond 2019. Our confidence level in achieving our long-term targets of 1% to 3% sales, 4% to 6% EBIT and 5% to 7% EPS are very high and I think that\u2019s where you will start to see those returns.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Andrew Lazar","Denise, I know you are clearly limited in what you can say on sort of the soup situation as you mentioned. But maybe perhaps you can comment a little bit on sort of what is behind the expectation for a moderation in soup declines in the fiscal second half. I guess what I am getting at is, you had mentioned progress and I am wondering if it can be I guess beneficial to all parties. I think Anthony has said maybe a more normal promotional posture. So just trying to get a sense of, what changes you can speak to and if it can be sort of what's called a mutual beneficial arrangement.","Denise Morrison","Well, as you know in the first half and particularly in this quarter, we did have U.S. soup sales declines and if you look at our consumption, it was minus 3%, our sales were down 7%. The consumption in the rest of the market was positive and so the rest of the market, the soup programs actually were very well received. As we go into the second half, given the positive conversations we have had, we expect a much more normal promotion schedule in the second half of the year and therefore our soup declines to moderate in the second half, and that\u2019s pretty much all I can say about it.","Andrew LazarOkay, I appreciate you laying out what you can, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi Research. Your line is now open.","David Driscoll","I literally have probably ten questions but I will keep to your rule and just ask one. Andrew got the soup one which is a great one but C Fresh, is profit recovery tied to sales growth? And then just explaining that a little further, what I am trying to get at is should we see profit recovery from these depressed levels even if sales are constant. And then related to C Fresh but on the sales line specifically, what is the second half expectation. It sounds like you are telling us that there should be a sizable boost with all the new product activity but I would really like to calibrate expectations while this segment has been hard for us to forecast.","Denise Morrison","Yes. That\u2019s about five questions but let take a crack at that. You know what we have going on in the second half of the year is we have much more robust innovation in beverages coupled with our supply constraints behind us and a normal promotional schedule. It's the first time that we have had all three legs of the stool going for us and that\u2019s why we are optimistic that we can make significant gains in the beverage business in the back half of the year. And the rest of our CPG business in Campbell Fresh is positive growth. So getting beverages back to growth and continuing that momentum in the other parts of the business. And that\u2019s the higher margin part of the business is an important idea.","In carrots, carrots and carrot ingredients actually grew. However, because of the yield issue we had due to the adverse weather, it cost us more. And therefore affected our profitability. Given that we have very robust plans in the supply chain and with improved productivity to make margin improvements in this business. And we are very very focused on executing those. So the growth of the top line in the CPG business coupled with the improvement of margins from the supply chain and productivity program, should give us a much more profitable growth algorithm on this business.","Anthony DiSilvestro","So just to add to that. The margin recovery is not sales dependent and we would expect to see top line growth and positive EBIT in Campbell Fresh in the second half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Ken Goldman","I am just curious, now that there has been a write-down taken, what about lessons that you learned from the Bolthouse acquisition and is there anything that you can take, either positively or negatively but hopefully constructively, and apply to the Snyder's Lance deal that\u2019s obviously ahead. Or is it really just sort of a unique situation to Bolthouse where things didn\u2019t go quite as well as you thought when you first bought the business. At least that\u2019s how we look at them on the outside.","Denise Morrison","Yes. And that\u2019s a very constructive question, and there have been lessons learned from the acquisitions, particularly that one. First of all, what we learned was that its' really an imperative to integrate supply train and quality earlier. And in fact right out of the gate Campbell's has a very high standard as you know and with what we went through in the Bolthouse Farms situation, we believe that that\u2019s an imperative and we are doing that with Pacific as we speak and we will do that with Snyder's Lance after we close. I think second of all, the carrot business was much more volatile than what we expected. This is fresh food and there is no roof over the factory of a carrot field and so are getting much better at recognizing what are the early warnings in that business. But that proved to be more volatile.","There won't be any necessarily lessons learnt from that because the Snyder's Lance acquisition and the Pacific acquisition are in categories that we have a lot more experience in. And then I think the third lesson is make sure you get the right people in the right place early. And so we are applying that philosophy going forward.","Ken Goldman","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Just a quick follow-up. Obviously Snyder's Lance has its own DSD. Pepperidge has its own DSD. You talked about integrating the supply chain right out of the gate. It doesn\u2019t require necessarily, how should I say this delicately, shutting down routes. That\u2019s not delicate but I tried. I am just trying to figure out because there is some speculation out there that you will have to shut down or consolidate somewhere else. That could be a little bit of an impediment to some of the goals that you have in that integration.","Anthony DiSilvestro","I can take that one. I would say we have no plans to integrate the actual DSD systems. These are independent distributors, so we will leave that at that. I think where we really see significant opportunity is we have overlapping warehouse systems, we have overlapping depots. And even before you get to the DSD guy, there is significant opportunity to extract cost synergies and that will be our focus in the near term.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Moskow","I wanted to ask a broader question about beverages and Campbell's. Challenges and what you consider your competitive advantages in beverages. I mean my perception is, a category like soup but the changes are more incremental and just relatively speaking. So Campbell can always compete. But beverages I just find that this competitive environment is changing all the time. You mentioned today that retailers are resetting the shelves away from sugar-enhanced items and refrigerated. You had continued challenges in V8. Can you just comment a little bit about what you see your competitive advantage are in beverage and whether why did beverage belong with a food company and maybe not with another beverage company.","Denise Morrison","Sure. I think it's really obvious when you look at consumer trends that there have been fundamental changes in consumer's preferences in the beverage category. Our competitive advantage in V8 is that we are vegetable based. And in our hundred percent vegetable juice and in our V8 + Energy, which is powered by green tea, we actually have performed pretty well. It's where we have had the combination of fruit and vegetable which is higher in sugar that we have been affected. And in the super premium segment of the Fresh business, we have now realized there is the same shift going on and that\u2019s why we have been very proactive in anticipating that shift and are able to launch a pretty extensive line of great tasting, reduced sugar with functional benefit beverages. And we have got more in the pipeline where that came from. So I feel really good that we are on top of the consumer trends, it is happening not only in juice but it's happening throughout beverage world. And the beverage business is profitable for us and we consider it a good part of our portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","David Palmer","Just wanted to ask a question on soup and want to get away from the one customer thing. Sometimes I feel like that keeps us from talking about the brand the category fundamentals. But if you just include all of your customers in this answer, are there opportunities for improvement in your perspective in your U.S. soup pricing and promotion strategy and perhaps things that you think about that will help the consistency of this business which will already be a smaller part of the business after Snyder's Lance.","Denise Morrison","Yes. We spend a lot of time with our revenue management and working with our customers on the right pricing and promotion plans. In fact, we go into that, our joint business planning, now through June with our key customers to work through that. We have to pay attention to the market place changes and this category is price elastic, so that\u2019s an important thing to pay attention to. And there is some different dynamics depending upon whether you are working with condensed soup, RTS or broth. But all of that is taken into consideration as we plan our next season.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Chris Growe","I just had a question for you in relation to cost inflation and how you are addressing that from this point forward, particularly around freight and obviously the things like butter. You had mentioned in some cases some price increases. Let me be a little surgical. So is it relying on cost savings, productivity, or is it pricing and maybe perhaps lower promotional spending to accommodate cost inflation is my question.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I would say we look at the latter. We look at it holistically and I would say that over time we expect our productivity improvement and price realization to more than offset cost inflation. Now obviously that can vary depending on the time period and we are seeing some pretty high cost inflation right now. I mentioned 3.5% cost inflation rate in the quarter. Significantly higher product prices and that\u2019s primarily hitting our Kelsen business and the second quarter is their largest quarter of the year. So it is having a differential impact in the quarter. Kelsen has taken some pricing to recover part but not all and we will look for productivity improvements to help there as well.","On the transportation and logistics side, this is volatile situation. Obviously, the rate increases are lasting longer than we expected. We don\u2019t know if this is a long-term phenomena yet but if it is, we would look to over time recover that through price realization as well. But we will have to watch that one a bit closer.","Chris Growe","Is this a year then, Anthony, where your pricing and your productivity combined, maybe it's more in the short term, cannot overcome the cost inflation, and therefore is that part of what that gross margin drag you estimate.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. So we see about a point of gross margin decline now. And I would say probably about 60 basis points of that is the base business for the very reason you said that we are not going to be able to cover cost inflation and these other supply chain issues that we are experiencing particularly around Campbell Fresh. And the other, say 40 basis points, is the Pacific Foods acquisition. We bought it in December so it's kind of an offseason for them. And then when you add purchase accounting, so we have got this one time step up on inventory, we have got incremental depreciation and amortization. That\u2019s making the Pacific Foods dilutive to gross margin in fiscal '18 but as we look ahead to 2019, we would expect Pacific to be modestly accretive at the EPS line. So we have got a couple of things this year that I would consider hopefully more one time in nature.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jason English","I apologize in advance but I want to come back to soup with two questions. First, I am not sure what it means that the back half of the year will be kind of normal promotional environment because you are kind of out of soup season. So there is not a whole lot of promotional environment in the back half of the year. Is it fair to interpret that as meaning when you go into the front half of next year, it's going to look more normal.","Denise Morrison","There actually is quite a bit of promotional activity through the third quarter. I would say it starts to wane in the fourth quarter. And, yes, we are anticipating that our promotional schedule will be more normal in the back half and in the first half of next year.","Jason English","That\u2019s helpful. And then my follow on. The situation is really fascinating. At the core it kind of looks like it's just been a big margin transfer with you taking some pain in the form of volume deleverage and then taking some gain in the form of the price increases you mentioned at retail that aren't your own. Do you think that that margin transfer is permanent and what is the risk that other retailers look to push for similar margin transfer.","Denise Morrison","I mean the only way I can answer that is that, again, we go through joint business planning with all of our customers and we work through what our pricing and programs are going to be for the upcoming season. This is annual in addition to shelving and merchandising. And you know that practice hasn\u2019t changed.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","John Baumgartner","Just I want to stick with soup and the investments there. There has been a lot of change in the simple meals category over the past few years whether it's been improved ingredients, frozen, traction from prepared, now there is meal delivery. So I guess in light of the increased competition or I guess even fragmentation now. Is it still reasonable to think that soup is kind of mid-20% margin business going forward. Why shouldn\u2019t we expect to see large reinvestments whether it's directly into pricing or even in the integrated marketing spend, just given the evolution.","Denise Morrison","Yes. I mean there is no question about the fact there is different kinds of competition that are coming into the marketplace and we have anticipated that competition. I mean Well Yes! Is a perfect example of where we co-created a brand with a consumer who is desiring a great taste in clean label, recognizable ingredient soup and we were able to put that out in the market and that brand is done very very well. I could also go to Slow Kettle, which fulfills the need for convenience [hearty] [ph] or a little bit more premium dinner soup. So I think that dynamic hasn\u2019t changed. If you listen to the consumer, there is still ways to satisfy that consumer as their preferences evolve in this category and [indiscernible] margins.","John Baumgartner","So it sounds as if the mix is still a lever you feel that you can pull going forward though.","Denise Morrison","Yes. Absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Feeney","Look forward to seeing you in Florida. Is there anything to read into closing the Snyder's Lance deal in the next few weeks. I think your initial press release had said some time in calendar Q2. Is there anything to read into that and related to that, Anthony your comment, I think it was the Ken's question that there are no intention to integrate the two independent business owner networks, I thought was fascinating. And maybe if you could, you delve into a little bit more to the extent you can, some of your follow up commentary on the kinds of synergies and kinds of integration you are going to hope to achieve in that supply chain. You mentioned different warehouses and what not. But if you are not putting those two things together, how exactly does putting those warehouse systems together work.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Sure. I guess our expectation at the moment is that the Snyder's Lance deal were closed towards the end of the calendar first quarter. The only major hurdle left is shareholder approval of the Snyder's Lance shareowners. All the rest, all the more significant hurdles have been crossed so hopefully that will happen at that time. And we will talk more about this next week but we continue to see significant cost synergy opportunity between our Pepperidge Farm business and Snyder's Lance. So $170 million of cost synergies and they run through a number of areas, but just commenting on the distribution side. Pepperidge Farm has a national warehouse system and a national depot system from hundreds of depots throughout the country. Snyder's Lance has exactly the same thing and this is even before the product gets to the independent distributor. So we see significant cost synergy opportunity in the distribution side of the business. We also see opportunity in procurement. We see supply chain opportunities. We see opportunities in number of other areas. So we remain highly confident that we can get to the synergy target that we have talked about with you before.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Michael Lavery","Just back on soup, you talk about the strength the private labels had and its share gains. Can you talk about some of what's driving that? Is it primarily shelf space in distribution games, is it an innovation push from the private label. Is it just pricing driven. What are some of the factors there?","Denise Morrison","Well, the way we are looking at it is private label grew share slightly in condensed and RTS, it grew share slightly, but is still below average and relatively small. Where private label has been more impactful has been in the broth business and what we have done is recognize that we have a differentiated product with Swanson and need to talk more about our product differentiation and continue to differentiate that product. In addition, the acquisition of Pacific Foods gives us a highly differentiated organic and functional broth product that we believe will set us up to satisfy different consumer needs.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ken Gosnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ken Gosnell","Thank you, Candice. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the third quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup\u2019s fiscal 2017. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO. As usual, we have created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in listen-only mode.","Today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risks. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.","One additional item before we begin our discussion of the quarter, I would like to cordially invite our sell-side analysts and institutional investors to our annual Investor Day at Campbell\u2019s World Headquarters. RSVPs are required. All others are invited to join by webcast. This year\u2019s event will be held in the afternoon of Wednesday, July 19. We will include updates on our plans and key initiatives for the three operating divisions. We will also have time for interacting with our management teams, so I hope everyone can make it.","With that, let me turn it over to Denise.","Denise Morrison","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I\u2019ll share my perspective on our performance this quarter and outline our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year.","First, some context on the macroeconomic environment. Overall macroeconomic trends in the U.S. improved slightly in the quarter. Consumer confidence edged up and unemployment declined modestly. However, in the first quarter of the calendar year, consumer spending only grew 0.3%, its lowest level of growth since 2009. Consumers entered 2017 facing a variety of interrelated pressures and complexities from economic shifts, delayed tax refunds and general uncertainty. Many consumers continued to struggle financially, especially lower income and younger shoppers. Additionally, the retailer environment continues to be very aggressive, with e-commerce and value players applying increased pressure on grocery and mass channels and we do not anticipate this trend to abate anytime soon.","Food companies certainly felt the pinch. It was a challenging quarter across the industry as top line growth remains scarce, especially in center-store categories. Consumers continue to migrate to fresher and healthier foods found on the perimeter of food stores. Like the majority of our peers, early in the calendar year, we experienced significantly lower consumption across almost all of our categories. At Campbell, we felt it most acutely in February. While trends improved as the quarter progressed, growth in March and April was insufficient to offset the earlier weakness. In the context of this unfavorable operating environment, we delivered competitive results in the third quarter. Although our top line was below our expectations, we grew or maintained market share in 11 measured categories, representing 75% of our U.S. retail dollar sales.","Looking at Campbell\u2019s results. Organic sales declined 1%, adjusted EBIT declined 2%, and adjusted earnings per share declined 9% to $0.59 a share, primarily due to a higher adjusted tax rate. The sales decline in the third quarter resulted from softer than expected soup sales the ongoing capacity related challenges in Campbell Fresh refrigerated beverages and weakness in V8 beverages. This more than offset the strong results from Global Biscuits and Snacks in the quarter.","Let\u2019s look at our 9-month results. Year-to-date, organic sales were down 1%, adjusted EBIT was comparable to a year ago and our adjusted EPS was up 1%. Reflecting our performance in the quarter, we revised our fiscal 2017 guidance this morning. We lowered our sales guidance to minus 1% to 0%, a point below our previous expectations. Despite the challenges on the top line, we have raised the low end of our adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS ranges. We now expect adjusted EBIT to increase 2% to 4% and adjusted EPS to increase 3% to 5%. We expect that we will be able to offset the impact of lower sales with our ongoing cost saving efforts, which are ahead of our expectations for the fiscal year.","Now, let me share my thoughts on our segment performance for the quarter and offer some perspective on our plans for the balance of the year. Let\u2019s start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. We continued to manage this division for performance consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. Organic sales declined by 2% in the quarter, predominantly driven by U.S. soup and V8 beverages. Operating earnings were comparable to a year ago. Importantly, we continued to expand gross margin in the division, even as we made investments in real food. As we previously outlined, we are in the process of eliminating artificial colors and flavors from our products, removing BPA from the can liners in our soup portfolio and increasing the use of real food ingredients such as chicken with no antibiotics in our soups.","Despite gaining share in the quarter, soup sales declined 4%, year-to-date, soup sales declined 1%. Although soup performance improved throughout the quarter, we were unable to overcome the slow start in February. Sales of condensed soup and broth declined, while our ready-to-serve portfolio grew. Promotional activities in support of condensed soup did not generate the anticipated lift, while the decline in broth was the result of continued competitive activity from private label. On the plus side, sales growth in our ready-to-serve portfolio was fueled by Chunky and our new Well Yes! soup line. Chunky benefited from increased merchandising, improved marketing and new items. We remain enthusiastic about the launch of our new Well Yes! clean label soup. Customer response has been strong and consumer trial is ahead of expectations. In the fourth quarter, we are planning to expand the Well Yes! line with five new varieties and to introduce a significant line extension to Chunky, new Chunky Max Bowls [ph], featuring 40% more protein. Given our performance year-to-date and with the season being largely complete, we are now calling for soup sales to be down slightly for the year even while we gained market share.","Beyond soup, Prego continues to perform well, driven by strong consumption, increased distribution in club channels and contributions from Prego\u2019s farmers market. V8 beverages continued to struggle as the shelf stable juice category remains challenged. As discussed last quarter, two-thirds of our shelf-stable juice portfolio, V8 100% Vegetable Juice, Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy is on trend and leverages our heritage in vegetable nutrition. The remaining third of the portfolio consisting of V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash is under pressure due in part to category wide consumer concerns about sugar. In the quarter, sales of both Fusion and Splash declined while V8 100% Vegetable Juice grew behind continued media investments. V8 +Energy also grew as we expanded distribution of new carbonated varieties. Year-to-date, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division is performing in line with its portfolio role. While organic sales have declined 1%, operating earnings have increased 5%.","Moving on to Campbell Fresh, C-Fresh remains an important strategic business for Campbell and we are confident in the growth potential of the Packaged Fresh category as consumer preferences for fresher and healthier foods remain strong. C-Fresh sales declined 6% in the quarter, primarily driven by continued production constraints following the June 2016 voluntary recall of Protein PLUS beverages.","As discussed during our last call, we have implemented enhanced processes to improve quality standards. We also started up a new beverage line in Bakersfield in the quarter and are in the midst of qualifying a new co-packer, which is slated to come online late in the fourth quarter. As expected, we still haven\u2019t returned to our original production levels. We have been able to fill orders for shelf stock. However, we have been unable to execute normal promotional activity across the fresh beverage portfolio. We expect continued capacity constraints through the fourth quarter as we fully operationalize our new line and our co-packer starts production. We will begin increasing promotion activity towards the end of the fiscal fourth quarter and expect to ramp up to normal levels in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. On the innovation front, the reception of our new Bolthouse Farms products, including the new plant-based protein milk, has been positive by retailers. We will start shipping this exciting new product early next fiscal year.","Turning to our farms business. Sales declined slightly driven by the natural ingredients business. We have made good progress stabilizing our carrot business, which delivered modest sales growth in the quarter as our quality and customer service levels have improved. Overall, we are moving in the right direction under our new leadership team. We have leveraged this tough situation this year to build the stronger foundation for growth. Looking ahead, we anticipate that C-Fresh will deliver modest sales growth in the fourth quarter as we lap the Protein PLUS recall. While we expect the beverage business will continue to improve, we will still be operating with less capacity than we had a year ago.","Turning now to Global Biscuits and Snacks. This division unifies our biscuits and snacks brands across Pepperidge Farm, Arnott\u2019s and Kelsen. The team delivered strong results in the quarter. Sales increased 2% and EBIT was up 14%. The two main drivers of the sales increase were Pepperidge Farm and Arnott\u2019s Biscuit in Asia-Pacific.","First, Pepperidge Farm. I am pleased with the performance of the team. Pepperidge Farm snacks continued to deliver strong results, fueled by Goldfish Crackers and Pepperidge Farm Cookies. Continued Goldfish growth was driven by larger pack sizes and multi-packs, increased advertising and the continued expansion of our health and well-being offerings, especially Goldfish made with organic wheat.","In cookies, sales increased across most of the portfolio. We are pleased with the April launch of our new Farmhouse Cookie brand. These new thin and crispy cookies are simply delicious. They leverage our baking heritage and are made with simple, real food ingredients. It\u2019s early days, but retailer response has been positive with more than 50% ACV distribution. Consumers have also responded very favorably. Sales declined slightly in our fresh bakery business, driven by Pepperidge Farms sandwich and swirl bread, coupled with increased spending to counter competitive activity. Buns and rolls delivered strong growth.","Turning to Australia. In a very challenging trading environment, we delivered sales growth in our biscuit portfolio. Our new Arnott\u2019s Tim Tam gelato-inspired varieties are performing well with strong customer acceptance and consumer takeaway. In addition, Arnott\u2019s Shapes continued to regain share with the return to several popular original flavors. We are preparing to ship at the end of July new multi-pack single-serve Arnott\u2019s Shapes, Tim Tams and Tiny Teddies in multiple sizes for take-home and on-the-go consumer occasions. In addition, our developing markets in Southeast Asia performed well with organic sales growth in both Indonesia and Malaysia. We are confident that the division will finish the year on a high note as we expect to maintain our current momentum and deliver solid sales growth and double digit operating earnings in the fourth quarter.","In conclusion, our team delivered competitive performance and what continued to be an extraordinarily difficult operating environment. However, we clearly have more work to do to address our sales performance. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, our plan calls for improved performance to finish the year as we cycle the Bolthouse Farms protein drink recall, last year\u2019s carrot quality issues and a higher adjusted tax rate. Additionally, we expect Global Biscuits and Snacks to maintain its current momentum. We also plan to return to more normal marketing level versus the stepped-up levels of a year ago. Finally, we are on track to slightly exceed our multi-year $300 million cost savings target by the end of the fiscal, a year earlier than originally planned. And as we announced last quarter, we are pursuing incremental cost savings of $150 million over the next few years.","Thank you. And I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks Denise and good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter. In the context of top line challenges that impacted much of the industry early in the first calendar quarter, I feel good about our sales performance. And as Denise mentioned, we grew or maintained share in 11 measured categories, representing 75% of our U.S. retail dollar sales. Sales for the quarter were below our expectations as declines early in the period were only partly offset by growth later in the quarter. Notably, Global Biscuits and Snacks had a strong quarter, achieving sales and double digit earnings growth. While adjusted gross margin declined 40 basis points in the quarter that includes an 80 basis points negative impact from wrapping mark to market gains on open commodity hedges.","Our promotional rate also had a negative impact on margin, exacerbated by weaker than expected volume performance. We continue to make progress on our cost savings initiatives, generating another $20 million of savings in the quarter, slightly better than expected. And we have now delivered $295 million program to-date. Adjusted EPS declined 9%. But as you will see, most of that is being driven by volatility in our tax rate. With one quarter to go, we are revising guidance with sales coming down slightly to reflect our third quarter performance, while we tighten our earnings ranges, raising the low end by 1 point, as we remain confident in our ability to deliver our full year expectations for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS.","Now I will review our results in more detail. For the third quarter, as reported net sales declined by 1% to $1.853 billion driven by a 1% decline in organic net sales, organic net sales declined in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Campbell Fresh were partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $305 million, reflecting the impact of a lower adjusted gross margin percentage and lower sales, partly offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Reflecting a 650 basis point increase in our adjusted tax rate, adjusted EPS decreased 9% or $0.06 to $0.59 per share. For the first nine months, as reported and organic net sales both declined by 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EPS was comparable to the prior year and adjusted EPS of $2.51 increased by 1%.","Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, organic net sales declined 1%, driven primarily by increased promotional spending in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, promotional spending rates were up in our U.S. Soup business as we increased spending to extend the soup season and added support to Swanson broth. We also increased spending in Canada to hold certain promoted prices following our list price increase. In Global Biscuits and Snacks, promotional spending was up in our Arnott\u2019s business as we shifted some spending from A&C to trade. Volume and mix were comparable to last year as volume gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks were offset by declines in Campbell Fresh as we continue to be impacted by supply constraints on Bolthouse Farms beverages. And although it rounds to zero on the chart, we did have a slightly positive impact from currency translation, principally the Australian dollar, bringing the change in our as reported sales to minus 1%.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased 40 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 170 basis points. On a rate basis, cost inflation was about 1.5%. We are also lapping mark-to-market gains on open commodity contracts in the prior year, which accounts for 80 basis points of the decline. These negative drivers were partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Increased promotional spending had a negative impact of 80 basis points, reflecting the drivers I previously discussed. Mix was neutral for the quarter. List pricing increases had a positive impact of 20 basis points, driven primarily by list price actions taken by our retail business in Canada.","Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which is incremental to our cost savings program, contributed 190 basis points to margin improvement in the quarter. All-in, our adjusted gross margin percentage declined 40 basis points to 36.6%. Adjusted marketing and selling expenses declined 5% in the quarter primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses in Arnott\u2019s as well as the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Adjusted administrative expenses increased 1%, reflecting higher healthcare costs, inflation and investments in long-term innovation mostly offset by lower incentive compensation.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line item. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.06 from $0.65 in the prior year quarter to $0.59 per share in the current quarter. On a currency neutral basis, the decline in adjusted EBIT had a $0.02 impact on adjusted EPS. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter increased by 650 basis points to 35% as the prior year benefited from lower taxes on foreign earnings. The increased tax rate reduced adjusted EPS by $0.06. Share repurchase reduced our share count, adding $0.01 EPS benefit. Interest expense was comparable to the prior year as the impact of lower debt level was offset by higher rates. Currency translation also had no impact on adjusted EPS, completing the bridge to $0.59 per share.","Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales fell by 2% as declines in soup and V8 beverages were partly offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces, SpaghettiOs pasta and Swanson canned poultry. Reflecting declines early in the quarter, sales of U.S. soup declined 4%, driven by declines in condensed soup and Swanson broth, partly offset by gains in ready-to-serve soups. Growth in RTS soups was driven by gains in Chunky and the launch of Well Yes!. Chunky soup performance reflects increased merchandising, improved execution and successful new items. The launch of Well Yes! continues to progress well, with strong customer acceptance supported with a robust marketing plan. Although soup sales declined in the quarter, we gained market share in the U.S. wet soup category. On a year-to-date basis, sales of U.S. soup declined 1%. Operating earnings in the quarter were comparable to the prior year as a higher gross margin percentage benefiting from supply chain productivity improvement and cost savings was offset by lower sales volumes.","Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending April 30, 2017, the category as a whole declined 70 basis points. Our sales performance was better than the category, declining just 20 basis points in measured channels. We had a 58.9% market share for the 52-week period with a share gain of 30 basis points. Private label grew share by 100 basis points, finishing at 13.9%. All other branded players collectively had a share of about 27%, declining 130 basis points.","In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2%, driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott\u2019s biscuits, with growth in both Australia and Indonesia. Pepperidge Farm sales increased as continuing growth in Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies was partly offset by declines in fresh bakery and frozen products. Operating earnings increased 14% to $98 million, reflecting volume growth and lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses.","In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales declined 6%, driven by lower sales of Bolthouse Farms beverages, which was in line with our expectations. Our Bolthouse Farms beverage business continues to be impacted by supply constraints. In the third quarter, we started up a new beverage line at our Bakersfield site. And together with the additional co-packer capacity that Denise mentioned, we expect to have sufficient capacity towards the end of the fourth quarter to support a more normal promotional schedule as we move into fiscal 2018.","Operating earnings declined by $12 million to $1 million, reflecting unfavorable sales volume and mix as well as the cost impact of reduced beverage capacity and enhanced quality processes. Cash flow from operations was $1.011 billion compared to $1.211 billion generated in the first nine months of last year. Cash flow in the prior year benefited from a significant reduction in working capital. Although we are below the prior year in which we generated a record level, we are on track to deliver another year of strong cash flow. Capital expenditures declined $30 million to $195 million. Our CapEx forecast remains unchanged at $325 million for fiscal 2017. We paid dividends totaling $314 million, up from $294 million in the prior year, reflecting our increased quarterly dividend rate to $0.35 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $305 million of shares compared to $118 million in 2016. Current year repurchases include $271 million under our strategic share repurchase program as we have increased our level of share repurchases, the balance were made to offset dilution from equity based compensation. Net debt declined by $212 million compared to year ago levels to just over $3 billion as cash from operations over the last four quarters exceeded capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases.","Now I will review our revised 2017 guidance. Reflecting the impact of sales performance below our expectations in the quarter, we are slightly reducing our sales guidance. We now expect sales to change by minus 1% to 0%, which is 1 percentage point below our previous range. With the impact of lower sales being offset by incremental cost savings, we are narrowing our earnings ranges. We now expect adjusted EBIT to grow by 2% to 4% compared to the previous range of 1% to 4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 3% to 5% compared to the previous range of 2% to 5%. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rates, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. We continue to expect our adjusted gross margin percentage to end the year at about 38%, almost 1 point better than last year. Our EPS guidance reflects a full year effective tax rate of approximately 32%, which is unchanged, implying a fourth quarter adjusted tax rate similar to the third quarter and the favorable impact of anticipated share repurchases over the remainder of the year. For those of you doing the fourth quarter math, the guidance implies strong earnings growth for the balance of the year. Anticipated fourth quarter earnings growth is benefiting from an improved gross margin as we wrap the impact of the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outages and we benefit from additional cost savings, cycle marketing investments above historical levels and from the continuing earnings momentum in Global Biscuits and Snacks. That concludes my remarks.","Now I will turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time, I would have the fairness to other callers, please ask only one question at a time. Okay, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi. Some of the companies in the packaged food space more recently have kind of been starting to walk away from some of their multiyear margin targets. I think seeing the need to maybe spend back more to stabilize the top line and maybe get a better balance of top line and margins back. And certainly, what we have seen from Campbell recently is a bit weaker sales like a lot of the industry, but of course much better cost saves and margin. So I guess I am wondering if, heading into \u201818, is there maybe a need maybe to spend back even more than the one half of the incremental cost saves that you had previously said you would, I guess, spend back through fiscal \u201820? Really, I guess I am asking, is \u201818 broadly speaking do you think it needs to be a bigger reinvestment year as it will likely end up being for some of your peer companies?","Denise Morrison","I think that the gross margin expansion that we have achieved has been done with a lot of analytic rigor and has gone after things that really are not hurting the business. And we definitely have kept our investment in advertising consumer and trade around that 24% level and that really hasn\u2019t changed although the mix changes by brand depending upon the competitive situation that it\u2019s in. With the $300 million, we have been able to save through our effective cost savings program, we have reinvested a significant portion of that back into the business and intend to do so as we go forward in pursuit of the $150 million that we will save. When you peel it back, our top line really needs to benefit from the return to growth of Campbell Fresh, which we expect next year and also continued progress to stabilize our V8 beverage business. Our Global Biscuits and Snacks business has momentum. Condensed is pretty stable. RTS grew nicely and we are under some pressure in broth. So we know what we have to do to get to that growth rate.","Andrew Lazar","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bryan Spillane","Hi, good morning everyone.","Denise Morrison","Hello, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","I guess a question on C-Fresh. Year-to-date, they are basically breakeven in terms of profits. And I guess now you have got the new production coming on beginning in the fourth quarter and some other things you have done to sort of increase efficiency. Anthony, can you just talk about kind of how long it takes to get back to the 5% or 6% EBIT margins you were before and kind of what the potential is above and beyond that, now that you have sort of retooled that business? I guess, essentially just trying to understand kind of the trajectory to get back to sort of a higher level of profitability.","Denise Morrison","Right, okay. So first of all, in the farms business, we believe that we are getting to stability on that business with significant improvements in quality and customer service. And then in the beverage business, by the end of the fourth quarter, we should be in a situation where we can produce enough product to satisfy shelf stock and also promotion merchandising demands from customers. Today, we are selling what we make and we can only fulfill shelf stock although that capacity is getting better with the line that we just put into our own plant and then the co-packer will get us back to where we can actually supply. We have plans to start to amp up on the beverage business early in fiscal 2018. And we expect, with the right marketing and promotion program with customers, we will continue to see that business growth. And we are planning on growth for that business next year. From the profit side, we have invested seriously this year in quality, but yet, we do expect margin expansion from this business for a couple of reasons. First of all, as we have delved into the supply chain, we have been able to realize that we have got opportunities for productivity. And quite frankly, it\u2019s a significant portion of the $150 million cost savings program that we have talked about before. And secondly, we expect margin expansion just from the fact that we will be growing the CPG higher margin business at a faster rate than the lower margin carrot business. So we should have some margin expansion due to mix shifts. So that\u2019s how we are looking at it at this point. And of course, we will keep you posted along the way.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I will just add to that, Bryan. I would say that our long-term margin target for C-Fresh is getting it to 10% and that\u2019s going to take a few years. And I think we will make meaningful progress in 2018 against this. We have identified opportunities in procurement. We have identified opportunities in terms of integrating supply chain and we have identified longer term back office consolidation opportunities as well. So we have a pretty robust plan. We think we can get these margins back in the near-term and look to make progress next year on it.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning. I am just curious on the cookies side of things, there is obviously one of your biggest competitors is making some pretty interesting changes there, I am just curious \u2013 two parts to this question I guess, in the near-term, are you seeing any particularly aggressive pricing activity, promotional activity from any competitors out there in events of this change. And then secondly, I am just curious strategically how you would think about what you might want to do at the company to sort of take advantage of some of the transitions that are happening and I know it\u2019s a little early to say exactly what will happen, but I am just trying to get a little sense of what management\u2019s view and outlook is on the situation?","Denise Morrison","Yes. I mean the environment in biscuit continues to be competitive, just like the rest of the environment, but we are very pleased with the performance of our Pepperidge Farm and our Arnott\u2019s business. I think the competitive situation you are talking about is in the United States. The program that we are running in the biscuit business is we are advertising our brands like Goldfish and Milano. We have increased innovation in all of our brands and with new innovation in Pepperidge Farm farmhouse cookies, which we are excited about. These cookies are clean label simple ingredients and thinner, crispy. They just provide a different experience. We have also upgraded our classic cookie line to respond to the fact that the market has moved in terms of quality and we need to maintain that edge. And then finally, we have a lot of confidence in our direct store delivery network in terms of their ability to merchandise and work the shelf in store. And we think that combination is serving us well and our business results are proving that out.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I would just add with respect to the DSD situation, obviously we are very aware of what\u2019s happening. We are watching it. And we are developing specific plans of our own to take advantage of that situation.","Ken Goldman","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Denise Morrison","Hi Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. I had just a quick, I guess kind of higher level question to ask for Denise and this quarter, you got a bit more promotional, it seem like there were some certain areas of the business where you got more promotional, at the same time, private label has got a little bit more price competitive and retailers seem to be getting a bit more aggressive with private label we saw for example with broth division, I just want to get a sense of the promotional, I guess landscape generally, how you see that kind of trending in the fourth quarter and then the degree which private label is becoming a bigger threat in some of these categories?","Denise Morrison","Yes. Let me start first with the retailer landscape, which is really competitive and we have got value players and e-commerce putting pressure on more conventional retail grocery and mass channels. And in that environment, the amp-up of promotion and also the push on private label continues to be pretty robust. What we have actually done in terms of our promotional spend is we have spent on broth for the holiday this quarter and we experienced some lower lift. We have increased our support \u2013 our promotion support on V8 +Energy because that brand is really gaining a lot of momentum. And the rest of our promotional spending has been on Global Biscuits and Snacks and particularly in Asia Pacific biscuits, we have a strong promotional program there. And then finally, we did hold our in-season soup prices longer than prior year. And in an EDLP environment, that actually hits the promotion line. But I assure you that we are continuing to manage the depth and frequency of our promotional program while we remain competitive and we have to do that. And we will continue to make marketing investments accordingly.","Chris Growe","Okay. It seems private label gets more aggressive, obviously in broth that was the case, is it becoming a theme now across\u2026?","Denise Morrison","And looking at our categories, most of them have \u2013 private label has been pretty much as it always has been, but we did experience an up-tick in soup and in particularly in the broth area.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Grainger","Hi, good morning. Thanks Denise. I just wanted to follow-up, I guess on the same topic, as you are seeing this increased pressure from e-commerce and some of the discounters continuing to build momentum, I know these two things aren\u2019t separate and distinct sort of investing in your products as opposed to your distribution platforms, but how does that impact your resource allocation as you think about how to direct investments between offerings and sort of internal resources that could facilitate a stronger presence in those channels and trying to accelerate that shift as opposed to putting near-term resources towards more traditional things innovation, merchandising, etcetera, that can help support your traditional retail partners and your categories, help support kind of return to growth in your categories in those channels?","Denise Morrison","Yes. Well, suffice it to say that we have always run a multi-channel business and so this isn\u2019t the first time that the retail landscape has morphed, although I have to say that I personally have called the shift to digital and e-commerce a seismic shift. So we are definitely making longer term plans to address that. But in the current term, e-commerce is about 4% of food sales and we are setting up resources to address that, but I can assure you that we still have very strong resources against our traditional partners.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Thanks Denise. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jason English","Good morning guys.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi Jason.","Jason English","Thank you for sliding me in. Two questions, first Anthony, a quick housekeeping item for you, just to get a little more comfort with the optics of the implied 20% EBIT growth in the fourth quarter, can you \u2013 could you quantify how big the size of the Bolthouse recall expense is going to be?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I will just go back to what we said last year. Last year, gross margin was down 90 basis points and we said 70 basis points of that was Bolthouse Farms and 50 basis points was the recall more narrowly defined.","Jason English","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then high order question for you Denise, you mentioned mix shift in terms of the AC&T spend that you have had against the business, I think we look industry wide, we have seen a pretty similar mix shift, the traditional pull day spend behind the A&C that rolls to SG&A has been shrinking industry wide for quite a few years now, more and more has moved into trade. And at the same time, volumes have become pretty challenged, private labels making more inroads. You are now seeing the deflationary impact kind of roll through your P&L and pressure margins as well. And you are not alone on that. But it all begs the question of is this the right move, the right shift or has the industry perhaps gone too far? Should we be pivoting back and putting more back into the traditional pull-based marketing, if you could weigh in with your high order or high level thoughts on that? Appreciate it.","Denise Morrison","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a great question and we really have to look at the marketing mix by brand and what the brands\u2019 objective is and how they are targeting, because under the A), there has also been a lot of movement away from classic TV and print and into digital, which creates a whole different kind of marketing, content development and a lot of efficiencies there. And we are still all getting better at how we measure effectiveness. But I also think in the, A), with the cost savings programs we have been running, we have been doing lots of deep dives into what\u2019s working media, what\u2019s not working media and how do we make sure we are moving more of our dollars to work harder for us. So, that\u2019s the high level answer on A. Of course, we are watching some of the shift to T, where we have got a very robust revenue management analytics group that supports our marketing and our sales force. They are looking at net price realization, because it\u2019s not only list price. It\u2019s also EDLP. It\u2019s also promoted price points. And so those vary by brand, but they are all tucked into the T part of ACT. And then finally, we are also seeing a bit of an uptick in shopper marketing and that\u2019s involved in that T as well. So, again, I think it\u2019s really hard to give you a one-size-fits-all answer, but this is a hypercompetitive marketplace and you have got to be agile in terms of how you run the business to make sure that we are remaining competitive. And we are proud of the fact that despite the difficult environment we have been able to maintain our market share across 75% of our business.","Jason English","Thanks a lot. I will pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Alexia.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi, Alexia.","Operator","Alexia, your line is now open. Please check your mute button. And our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. Your line is now open.","Denise Morrison","Hello, David.","David Driscoll","Thank you and good morning. I had just a quick follow-up on the quarter and then a question about C-Fresh. So if the quarter turned out worse than you expected, I just don\u2019t think I am clear on why you are raising the bottom end of your EPS guidance. I know it\u2019s just a small change, but it just wasn\u2019t clear to me what got better that made you wanted to raise that bottom end. If you could start there and then I had a quick one on C-Fresh.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I think the quick answer to that is we weren\u2019t near the low end of those earnings ranges before the quarter. So we are just with one quarter to go, we thought it was prudent to tighten them up a bit. And again, we were already above the low end before.","David Driscoll","Okay, that\u2019s fine. And then on C-Fresh, was the revenue guidance reduction in significant part related to underperformance of C-Fresh revenues in the quarter? And if that\u2019s true, can you just talk a little bit more about your confidence in why this business can get back on track? I mean, have you lost shelf space for the CPG beverages? What\u2019s the consumer impression of the brand given the difficulties that it had? I feel like the quarter didn\u2019t come out as you had hoped and I am just concerned that, that has implications on C-Fresh going forward?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I will take the first part. The revenue guidance reduction does not stem from changes in C-Fresh. It\u2019s related to the performance of our shelf stable businesses in the U.S.","Denise Morrison","And I will take the second part. David, recall that we put a new leadership team into C-Fresh earlier this year and their mandate was to conduct a deep dive strategic review of the business. And we even retained help to do that so that we make sure that we had a real objective look and we were not talking to ourselves. And so this team did an exhaustive review of the categories, the opportunities, the potential for the business as we have got our capacity back up. We looked at both the CPG businesses. We have really looked at the beverage business and then we also looked at the farms business. And they came back confirming the potential of the business to deliver growth in excess of our long-term targets and at multiples of center-store categories. So we will be running that play. That is a 3-year strategic plan that they created and that will go into the next year\u2019s operating plan. So we really took this opportunity in a tough situation to go all the way back to go and say, what did we assume when we bought this business and are those assumptions still valid, and how do you see the potential of this business. And quite frankly, with the consumers\u2019 shifts to fresh, we think that going forward we are going to be in good position to capitalize on that shift.","David Driscoll","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. I will pass it along.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Dickerson of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Rob Dickerson","Thank you very much. Hello. I just had a bit of a general question on Pepperidge Farm in the U.S. and the distribution model that you use there [indiscernible], it seems like Pepperidge obviously is one of your stronger brands and continues to do well innovation, given I understand the category has always remained competitive, but if you kind of view that distribution model for the time being at least as the competitive advantage, then why haven\u2019t you and why wouldn\u2019t you consider placing more products on those routes to essentially push more into smaller stores and faster growing channels, etcetera, rather than just constrain it under current brands? Thanks.","Denise Morrison","Yes. You look \u2013 we run three different kinds of supply chain here. We run a warehouse supply chain. We run a fresh supply chain. And then in Pepperidge Farm, as you indicate, we run an independent distribution system through DSD. These distributors are entrepreneurs and they have built a great business. In the snacks business, you do see a portion of the business in warehouse snacks, but you also see a large portion of the snacks business, whether it be sweet, savory or salty in DSD. So we still believe in the model for this category and the operations part of it calls for a very focused category distribution. That\u2019s where you can get the maximum effectiveness and efficiency. In fact, we have two separate DSD networks, one for bakery and one for snacks, because of that reason. And we do believe that DSD also helps with the quality of the product and making sure that we are working the shelves every day.","Anthony DiSilvestro","I would just add that in terms of the latter part of your question, we don\u2019t feel that we are constrained by just Pepperidge Farm products. We do think we have the velocity and the volume to push into the smaller stores and push into the growing channels. We continually look at the system. Sometimes, we split routes to make them smaller to enable that kind of enhanced distribution. But again, we don\u2019t think we are constraining our growth.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, great. And then just quickly, fresh bakery, you have called out some, I think increased competitive pressure, just simple drivers as to what\u2019s going on there? Thanks.","Denise Morrison","The fresh bakery, we have been under pressure with Swirl bread and sandwich bread. We have now increased the quality and reformulated our Swirl bread and we are out with new sandwich bread offerings. So we believe we have responded to that. And our buns and roll business seem \u2013 continues to be really robust and we will be continuing to push that one. So bakery was down slightly.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks very much. When I look at this Q4 margin at the midpoint, midpoint to midpoint it\u2019s like 17.8%, which would be the record by as far as I know, forever, for the last 10 years. And typically there is a seasonality in this business that makes this one of the lower margin quarter. So on the things I don\u2019t think it doesn\u2019t seem like at least over the past few years that much has changed in terms of the seasonality of margins. So are the things you are doing here in the fourth quarter indicative of structural progress in margin going forward? And if you could comment about how that breaks down? Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. Jonathan, I would say no, is the short answer. I think what happens as you get into our fourth quarter, which is relatively small. So any changes that we make, has kind of exacerbated at the margin. But as we look at it and look, we have always expected a robust fourth quarter and there are several key drivers. One is the significant expansion in gross margin. We are lapping a 90 basis point decline last year, most of which was driven by Bolthouse. We will benefit from incremental cost savings coming through our supply chain as well as our ongoing productivity program which has been performing really, really well. As Denise mentioned, we are cycling a very high level of marketing investment. And I think it went up about 150 basis points last year. We will return to more kind of normal levels. And lastly, our GBS business had a really strong third quarter. We anticipate it will have another strong quarter in the fourth. So, if you look at all those factors together, we are pretty confident in our guidance.","Jonathan Feeney","So just to follow-up on that, Anthony, everything but the GBS \u2013 those are like relative changes year-over-year, but I completely get that it\u2019s a big move year-over-year. But in the absolute, all of those things are things that would presumably persist into fiscal \u201818. So global baking and snacking, we don\u2019t know what the trends are going to be going into fiscal \u201818. So, it\u2019s probably like it sounds like a lot of this is structural progress productivity in the business and maybe partially held back by C-Fresh productivity.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, I think just a good way to look at it. If you go back to last year, I mean, our fourth quarter was very weak and we had a great year in terms of generating cost savings. So I think our fourth quarter last year didn\u2019t really reflect many of the things that we have been working on and those are going to come through this year.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","John Baumgartner","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Denise, I would like to come back to C-Fresh for a minute and specifically on the carrot side. I think it was about 2 years ago where there was a bit of optimism that you would be able to enhance some of the growth in margins by moving more into snacking and convenience. I think one of the products you were testing was called shakedowns. But more recently, we haven\u2019t really heard a lot about that push. So I am curious, with this new management team coming in, will those opportunities still exist and kind of how you are thinking about those options?","Denise Morrison","Yes. Just to specifically answer your question in shakedowns, we actually have shakedowns in a couple of the school systems in the country. We have moved those more out of retail and into working with schools to give kids healthier snacks. In terms of the new management team coming in, their first and foremost objective is now that we have got our quality and our customer service back is to make sure that we are shoring up our business with customers and making sure customers are happy. In addition to that, we will innovate some things in carrots. For example, one of the things they have are rainbow carrots where we have been able to grow different colored carrots. So, we are working with those in a few retailers. But I think suffice it to say that most of the innovation will happen in the CPG business. That\u2019s where we really are pushing innovation, but we will do enough in carrots to make sure that we are keeping that business stable to modestly growing.","John Baumgartner","And then just as a follow-up. In that CPG business, especially on the beverages side, it feels as though that shelf space is becoming a lot more competitive with a lot of new entries in there. Can you just speak a little bit to the competitive dynamics that you are seeing in the refrigerated shelf?","Denise Morrison","I am not sure I understood your question. What business were you talking about?","John Baumgartner","On the refrigerated beverages side, just seeing a lot of new brands popping up in the category?","Denise Morrison","Yes. I think the refrigerated beverage business is very competitive and we have seen \u2013 the advent of ultra-premium juice, the fermented juices coming or fermented beverages coming in, but we do believe we have a great product and we have a range of across super premium and premium juice. We have been again strapped, because we haven\u2019t had the supply and the capacity to meet that increased demand. So next year, we will be running a full play.","John Baumgartner","Good. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gosnell for any closing remarks.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks everyone for joining.","Denise Morrison","Thank you.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks everyone for joining our third quarter earnings call and webcast.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I'd now like to introduce to your host for today's conference, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Kate. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call and webcast for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, our new Chief Financial Officer; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations.","I am going to comment first on items impacting comparability in the quarter. Denise will follow me with a high level perspective on our third quarter. Anthony will wrap it up with a more detailed look at the financial and segment results as well as our guidance. After that we will take your questions.","As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com and on our IR app which is available through Google or Apple. Please keep in mind that this call is open to members of the media who are participating in listen-only mode.","Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements, which reflect the company's current expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks.","Please refer to slide three in the presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements.","Now for those items impacting comparability. Our discussion of the third quarter will exclude an $18 million pre-tax pension settlement charge associated with the U.S. pension plan. In fiscal 2014 we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $14 million to streamline business operations in China. In the first quarter we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges and related cost of $23 million to streamline our salaried workforce in North America and our workforce in the Asia Pacific region and to previously announced initiatives.","Our discussion of year-to-date results will exclude restructuring charges, our loss on foreign exchange forward contracts and a tax expense related to the sale of our European business in the current year. Last year we recorded $21 million of pre-tax restructuring charges and related costs in the third quarter and $48 million in the second quarter related to our U.S. supply chain structure and the manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico.","In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded $43 million of restructuring charges and related costs associated with the U.S. supply chain initiatives and $10 million of transaction costs associated with the Bolthouse acquisition. Since our presentation includes non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules we provided a reconciliation of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation. These slides along with our earnings release and selected quarterly financials also can be found on our website accessible by computer or on your mobile device with the Campbell IR app.","I\u2019ve got one more thing if I could, we\u2019d like to cordially invite our sale side analysts and the buy side to our Annual Investor Day at Campbell World Headquarters. This year\u2019s event will be held in the morning of July 22nd, Tuesday and will feature presentations by Denise Morrison, Anthony DiSilvestro and several other Campbell leaders. We will unveil our innovations for the next year, outline our new beverage strategy, describe plans for soup and provide the tasty luncheon featuring Campbell products. We hope you will join us either via webcast or better yet live or at World Headquarters here in Camden, New Jersey, RSVPs are required for those attending in person.","And with that, let me turn it over to Denise.","Denise Morrison","","Thank you, Jennifer and welcome everyone. Thanks for joining Campbell\u2019s earnings call. Our sales results for the quarter were mixed. Sales in U.S. Simple Meals grew 7%, powered by strong topline performance in our sauce business. Plum Organics added 4 points to our sales growth in Simple Meals. Bolthouse Farms delivered 6% top-line growth over the prior year. Biscuit sales in Asia-Pacific grew, driven by double-digit growth in Indonesia. However, we did not grow our U.S. Soup business and experienced sales declines in U.S. Beverages, Pepperidge Farm, and our business in Australia.","Overall, organic net sales grew 1% which was 1% below our expectations, and I am disappointed that we failed to deliver the sales growth that we anticipated in the third quarter. We believe this is in part a reflection of the persistence of an exceptionally challenging consumer environment. As many others in the industry have noted, consumers are suffering from continuing underemployment, reductions in the SNAP program and rising home, fuel, and healthcare costs.","In combination, these factors are significantly affecting purchasing behavior, pressuring the performance of a number of our key customers and constraining growth across the industry, particularly in center store categories.","Our adjusted EBIT increased 12% in the third quarter, reflecting lower administrative expenses, including lower incentive compensation costs and our cost reduction efforts. This was more than sufficient to offset the impact of a reduced gross margin percentage and deliver positive EBIT performance.","Following our strong results in the second quarter, we reaffirmed our external guidance for the fiscal year which called for sales growth of 4% to 5%; adjusted EBIT growth of 4% to 6%; and adjusted EPS growth of 2% to 4%. As we communicated at the time, achieving this level of performance was predicated on improving our marketplace performance relative to the first half.","Unfortunately, our performance in U.S. Soup did not improve in Q3, and sales of Pepperidge Farm were below expectations. Consequently, we are lowering our sales guidance for the full year to 3% growth. We are maintaining our previous full year guidance on earnings; however, we are refining our estimates to the low end of the 4% to 6% range for adjusted EBIT growth and the low end of the 2% to 4% range for adjusted EPS growth.","Let me offer some perspective on our performance in the quarter. Sales in U.S. Soup were comparable to the strong year-ago quarter when sales increased by 14%. Within soup, broth sales grew 14%, but condensed soup and RTS soup posted declines.","Within soup, we have been refining how we optimize all drivers of demand. In the third quarter, we redeployed funds from advertising and consumer promotion to support increased trade promotion activity. We held our promoted price points and increased promotional frequency, extending across a broader customer base. While we executed the programs effectively, the enhanced trade promotion did not yield the anticipated lift in volume.","In addition to a strong promotion plan, we introduced 8 new soups in January under an accelerated timeframe, including pub inspired Chunky, Healthy Request, and Latin inspired condensed soups. On balance, they generated the sales we had anticipated. However, all of this activity did not generate the incremental sales that we had expected. Overall, dollar consumption in the U.S. soup category has declined marginally year-to-date and our share has remained relatively stable. I can assure you that we are examining the same questions that you are and we are formulating the most effective responses for next season.","Within Simple Meals, we did have some bright spots. Our Broth condensed cooking soups and sauces grew nicely. The common threat with these products is that consumers are combining them with fresh ingredients to prepare home cooked meals. Prego's growth got a significant boost from our expanding line of White sauces and innovation with Red distinctive sauces, Campbell's Skillet sauces and new Slow Cooker sauces in pouch packaging have now achieved 76% ACV distribution with 60% of retailers giving this new segment a dedicated section in the store. Sales continued to build as expected for those products.","Our goal remains to increase our competitiveness and profitably grow our core business. I feel that our Simple Meals business remain competitive in the third quarter despite falling short of our topline expectations in soup.","Turning to Global Baking and Snacking, Pepperidge Farm sales were softer than anticipated. Goldfish crackers achieved modest sales growth of 2% boosted in part by Goldfish Puffs, which are performing well. Goldfish crackers grew sales on the back of increased promotions in a very competitive environment and gained momentum as the quarter progressed.","However, we saw a significant slowdown in the overall cracker category and a decline in our adult savory crackers which impacted our overall snacks results. We have reformulated and re-launched our adult savory crackers as Pepperidge Farm Cracker Chips and expect better performance going forward.","Pepperidge Farm cookies had a weaker than expected performance, also wrapping a strong year-ago quarter. Pepperidge Farm bakery grew as we maintained our shelf space and increased sales of sandwich rolls and buns. It is evident that we have held our own despite the reentry of Hostess in the marketplace.","Internationally, we continue to deliver double-digit growth in Indonesia. During the quarter, we remained focused on stabilizing our Arnott's biscuit business in Australia for the long-term. The Kelsen acquisition at the start of the fiscal year has given us a growth platform for biscuits in China and Hong Kong, Kelsen is tracking with our expectations.","Turning to our U.S. beverage business, we said before it wouldn't be a growth engine this year. The shelf stable beverage category continued to be pressured by competition from a growing array of package fresh and specialty juices. We were encouraged by the third quarter performance of our V8 Red 100% vegetable juice, which has now delivered sales growth for four consecutive months. Our V8 Energy during continued their strong growth trajectory, but V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash declined.","In single serve, we continued to make progress in building our new national distributor network for immediate consumption channels. We plan to discuss our new strategy to revitalize U.S. Beverages at Campbell\u2019s Investor Day in July.","Bolthouse Farms is on track to deliver the second half growth that we expected. Third quarter sales of premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings grew double-digits. Bolthouse Farms is launching its spring innovation suite of 47 new products ranging from new stone fruit and root vegetable juices to delicious Greek yogurt salad dressings. We made a decision this year to make our first investments in Bolthouse Farms\u2019 advertising, and we\u2019re pleased with the market share volume trends and brand awareness.","Our acquisition of Plum Organics enabled us to enter the fast growing organic segment of the U.S. baby food category. In the second half we expected Plum to show improvement with the full product range back in supply expanding distribution and introducing several new products, it has done so. We continue to believe that Plum is a well-positioned on-trend brand that is an excellent fit with our $1 billion portfolio of foods that appeal to children.","Before I turn the call over to Anthony, I want to share a few final observations about the third quarter and our strategy. We said in the second quarter that we expected gross margin in the second half to be flat. However, in the third quarter our gross margin was negatively impacted by lower sales volume because our trade spending did not result in the expected sales increases. Finally our continuing focus on disciplined cost management is making a difference on the bottom-line as we delivered third quarter earnings growth in a very competitive environment.","To sum up, we are making no excuses for our disappointing sales. We own the results. Our third quarter sales did not meet our expectations or yours. But our team remains resolutely focused on executing our dual mandate to strengthen our core business and expand in the higher growth spaces.","We have no elusions about the challenges that we are facing in a tough environment we are not alone in that regard which is why we are also focused on driving growth through four bold moves, delivering breakthrough innovation, building our presence in package fresh foods, increasing availability in faster growing channels and expanding in developing markets. We believe that we have the right long-term strategy to deliver sustainable profitable net sales growth and build shareholder value. We continue to reshape Campbell to respond to the seismic shifts in our industry and meet the evolving needs of increasingly diverse consumers.","We have come far since our journey began in 2011 and I look forward to sharing more details about the next steps on our strategic path at Campbell\u2019s Investor Day on July 22nd. Thank you I look forward to answering your questions in a few minute now I would like to turn the call over to Anthony DiSilvestro our new CFO.","Anthony DiSilvestro","","Good morning and thanks Denise. Before getting into the detail I wanted to give some perspective on our results and guidance. As you will see the shape of our P&L reflects a shift within our marketing programs. While total marketing which includes advertising, consumer and trade is up for both the quarter and the year we have redeployed funds from A&C to support increased trade promotions. This is reflected on the P&L as a lower gross margin percentage with a offset in lower A&C expense which we report in our marketing and selling line.","The second item I want to highlight is the significant reduction in our administrative expenses. Because our fiscal 2014 results are below our expectations, we are accruing incentive compensation below targeted levels. Lower pension expense and the savings from our recent restructuring initiatives are also contributing to this decline in administrative cost.","Lastly, we are reducing our guidance for sales growth. As Denise mentioned, in our U.S. Soup business, we increased our promotional activity; however, we did not realize the anticipated volume lift.","Additionally in Pepperidge Farm, our volumes have been impacted by increased competitive activity in the snacks category and in response we have also increased our promotional spending. As a result of these two issues, we are lowering our expectations for full year sales growth to approximately 3%.","Now, I will review our results. I will start with our third quarter results and segment highlights followed by a brief look at our year-to-date results and then wrap up with our full year guidance.","As Jennifer mentioned, my discussion of result will exclude items impacting comparability. For the third quarter, we reported net sales from continuing operations of $1,970 million, comparable to the year ago quarter. As Denise mentioned, we were disappointed with our sales in the quarter as U.S. Soup and Pepperidge Farm sales were below our expectations.","Our sales results include a 2 point contribution from Kelsen and Plum Organics acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions and the negative impact of currency, organic net sales increased by 1%, driven by gains in our U.S. Simple Meals and our Bolthouse and Foodservice segments, partly offset by decline in International Simple Meals and Beverages and in U.S. Beverages. The organic sales increase was on top of last year\u2019s 4% gains.","Adjusted EBIT increased 12% to $310 million. The increase was driven by lower administrative expenses. Lower marketing expenses offset the lower gross margin percentage which reflected higher promotional spending. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.62, a 7% increase versus the prior year, reflecting the EBIT growth partly offset by a higher tax rate.","The next slide shows the composition of our sales performance. The organic sales increase of 1% reflects 2 points of favorable volume mix, and 2 points of growth from higher selling prices, partly offset by 3 points from increased promotional spending. Unfavorable currency had a 2 point impact due to the Australian and Canadian dollars weakening against the U.S. dollar, while acquisitions added 2 points.","The favorable volume mix is driven by our U.S. Simple Meals and our Bolthouse and Foodservice segments. The pricing gains were primarily related to our list price increases on U.S. condensed soup and in our Global Baking and Snacking segment. The promotional spending variance was primarily related to higher rates of spending in Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Simple Meals.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 1.8 points to 220 basis points to 36%. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of Kelsen and Plum. The combination of purchase accounting inventory step-up for Kelsen and the Plum recall had a negative impact of 1 full point. The ongoing impact on gross margin from the addition of the lower-margin Kelsen and Plum businesses is about 40 basis points. The balance of the margin reduction was largely due to negative mix. The inflation rate and cost of goods sold was about 3% for the quarter, entirely offset by productivity savings.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 1.8 points to 35.2%. Of the decline, 1.2 points came from the base business and 60 basis points was the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the decline in gross margin was primarily due to higher promotional spending, increased supply chain cost and cost inflation, partly offset by productivity improvements and higher selling prices. Our margin performance was below our expectations, reflecting the lowering than projected sales lifts from promotional spending and increased supply chain cost.","In North America, cold weather was a key cost driver as it disrupted the distribution and warehousing network as well as impacting our plant performance. The rate increase in cost of goods sold was approximately 4% in the quarter including about 2 points from inflation and the balance from higher supply chain costs. This increase was partly offset by productivity savings. Looking ahead, inflation and cost of goods sold for the year continues to be estimated as 3% to 4%.","Marketing and selling expenses for the quarter decreased $28 million to $217 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower A&C expenses and the negative impact of currency. Excluding acquisitions, A&C for the quarter fell 19% and was down 5% year-to-date while total marketing trade setting increased for both periods.","Administrative expenses decreased $30 million to $134 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, lower pension and healthcare expenses and cost savings from recent restructuring initiatives, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions which ended approximately $6 million.","Now, let's look at below the line items. For the quarter, net interest expense decreased $1 million to $30 million. The adjusted tax rate was 30.7%, a 4% increase versus the prior year. The prior year benefitted from lower taxes on foreign earnings and the favorable settlement of certain state tax matters. Reflecting the higher tax rate, adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased 7% to $195 million.","Third quarter segment sales results and organic growth rates are shown on the next slide. Our U.S. Simple Meals segment delivered $672 million in sales including a $24 million contribution from the acquisition of Plum Organics. U.S. Simple Meals organic sales increased by 3%. Within this segment U.S. Soup sales were comparable to a strong prior year quarter that saw a soup sales increase by 14%. Consumer takeaway in measured channels was down 2% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with inventory levels higher than last year, due to the late holiday timing.","Excluding the impact of the Plum acquisition, U.S. sauce organic sales increased by 11%. The increase was driven by gains in Prego pasta sauce which benefited from the introduction of Prego white sauces, Campbell\u2019s dinner sauces and Pace Mexican sauces. Our Global Baking and Snacking segment delivered $564 million in sales, including a $70 million contribution from Kelsen. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year, with growth in Arnott\u2019s offset by declines Pepperidge Farm.","Sales gains in Arnott\u2019s were driven by strong growth in Indonesia partly offset by declines in Australia from Savory and sweet varieties. The sales decline in Pepperidge Farm reflected declines in frozen products and snacks partly offset by growth in fresh bakery. Within Snacks, declines in adult cracker varieties and Pepperidge Farm cookies were partly offset by increases in Goldfish snack crackers.","Our Bolthouse and Food Service segment posted $358 million in sales an increase of 4%. Sales rose 6% of Bolthouse Farms driven by double-digit gains in premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. Organic sales in North America food service increased compared to the prior year. U.S. Beverage sales declined by 4% to $190 million. The decrease in sales was driven by declines in V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash beverages partly offset by volume gains in V8 Vegetable Juice. While sales of V8 V-Fusion declined our + Energy product has achieved significant growth.","International Simple Meals and Beverages delivered $186 million in sales for the quarter. Organic sales decreased by 7%. Sales declined in Latin America, the Asia Pacific region and Canada. The sales decline in Latin America was primarily due to lower volumes and lower selling prices associated with the implementation of the new business model in Mexico.","Sales in the Asia Pacific region decreased due to declines in Australia and Japan partly offset by gains in Malaysia. Sales in Canada decreased on declines in beverages partly offset by gains in both snacks and soup.","Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased 12% to $175 million, operating earnings increased primarily due to lower marketing and administrative expenses partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Operating earnings for Global Baking and Snacking decreased 7% to $68 million primarily due to Kelsen Group\u2019s off season operating results. Excluding Kelsen operating earnings decreased slightly as lower earnings in Arnott's and the unfavorable impact of currency were partially offset by earnings growth in Pepperidge Farm.","Operating earnings for U.S. beverages decreased by 12% to $29 million. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily driven by cost inflation, increased supply chain costs and higher marketing expenses partly offset by lower administrative expenses and productivity improvement.","In the International Simple Meals and Beverages operating earnings were $27 million a decline of 4%. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to lower volumes partly offset by lower administrative and selling expenses. Operating earnings within Bolthouse and Foodservice declined by 15% to $23 million, the decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to cost inflation and increased promotional spending and advertising in Bolthouse Farms [partly offset] by higher volumes and lower administrative expenses.","On the next slide, you can see U.S. soup sales were comparable to the prior year quarter, sales in condensed soups decreased 3%, with sales declines in eating varieties partly offset by gains in cooking soups. Lower volumes were partly offset by higher selling prices net of higher promotional spending.","Ready-to-serve soup sales declined 1% with declines in both canned and microwavable varieties. Broth had a strong quarter as sales increased 14% driven by double digit volumes gains in aseptic varieties. U.S. soup sales for the first nine months decreased to 1%. The decrease reflects a 4% decline in ready-to-serve soups and a 2% decline in condensed soups partly offset by an 11% increased in Broth.","Let\u2019s take a look at U.S. wet soups category performance in the past 52 weeks and our share performance as measured by IRI. For the period ending April 27, 2014 the category as a whole declined 0.6%, [our] sales in measured channels declined 1.1% with weakness in condensed and ready-to-serve soups partly offset by strength in Broth.","Campbell had nearly a 60% market share, a decrease of 30 basis points in the period. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28% with private label at 13%.","For the nine months, net sales from continuing operations were $6,416 million up 1% from the prior year. These sales results include a 4-point contribution from acquisitions, which consist of Plum Organics; Kelsen, acquired on August 8; and one additional week of results from Bolthouse Farms, which closed one week into the first quarter a year ago.","Excluding acquisitions and the negative impact of currency, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year. Gains in Bolthouse and Foodservice, U.S. Simple Meals and the Global Baking and Snacking segments were offset by declines in U.S. Beverages and in International Simple Meals and Beverages.","Adjusted EBIT of $1,022 million was comparable to the prior year as lower administrative expenses were offset by lower gross margin percentage. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.04 were comparable to a year ago.","For the first nine months, sales grew 1% with organic sales comparable to the prior year as the impact of higher selling prices was fully offset by higher promotional spending. Acquisitions added 4 points while currency subtracted 2 points.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 1.8 points to 35.6%. The decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to cost inflation, higher promotional spend, increased supply chain costs and the impact of acquisitions including the November 2013 Plum Organics recall, partly offset by productivity improvements and higher selling prices. The increase in cost of goods sold was approximately 4% for the first nine months, partly offset by productivity savings of 3%.","Marketing and selling expenses decreased 1% to $746 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, the impact of currency, and lower marketing overhead expenses partly offset by the addition of acquisitions.","Administrative expenses decreased $58 million to $424 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, lower pension and healthcare expenses, and cost savings from recent restructuring initiatives, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions which added approximately $16 million.","For the first nine months, net interest expense decreased $6 million to $89 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on our debt portfolio. We expect to finish the year with net interest costs of about $120 million. The adjusted tax rate for the first nine months was 31.3%, a 50 basis point increase versus the prior year. The prior year benefited from the favorable settlement of certain state tax matters.","We continue to expect a tax rate for fiscal 2014 of 31% to 32%. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations decreased 1% to $645 million. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.04 were comparable to the prior year. Cash flow from operations was $763 million compared with $864 million in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to lower cash earnings and the taxes paid on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business partly offset by lower working capital requirements.","Capital expenditures of $198 million decreased from $205 million a year ago. We are still expecting capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $350 million. Net debt decreased by $113 million to $3,687 million.","We have revised our full year guidance for fiscal 2014. We now expect that sales from continuing operations will grow approximately 3% compared with the previous range of 4% to 5%, reflecting the recent shortfall in sales growth from U.S. Soup and Pepperidge Farm. Full year growth in adjusted EBIT is expected to be at the low end of the previously forecast range of 4% to 6%. And adjusted EPS for the full year is expected to be at the low end of the previously announced guidance of 2% to 4%.","Several items are worth highlighting. Fiscal 2014 comprises 53 weeks, one additional week compared to the prior year. We estimate the extra week will benefit sales growth by about 2%, EBIT growth by approximately 3% and EPS by approximately $0.08. Going the other direction, we expect currency translation will have a 2% negative impact on sales, EBIT and EPS.","Next, for the full year we expect incentive compensation cost will be below target levels by approximately $40 million or $0.08 per share. As you might imagine, this will be a headwind next year along with the 53rd week. Two other items we\u2019ve talked about are the contribution to sales from acquisitions which we continue to project at about $300 million. And in connection with the new business model in Mexico, reported sales and costs of products sold are now expected to be reduced by approximately $30 million.","Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Jennifer.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks Anthony. At this time, Campbell will conduct a Q&A session. We\u2019d like to request that our callers limit themselves to a single question so we can respond to more analysts. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Growe - Stifel","","Hi, good morning.","Denise Morrison","","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Growe - Stifel","","Hi, good morning. Let me just ask you first, I guess Denise, in relation to the reduction in revenue growth for the year, it sounds like it was driven by Soup and Pepperidge and therefore, what I am getting at is, is the rush in the guidance due to the base business, or is there any change in your contribution from acquisitions that\u2019s occurring as well to bring that revenue guidance down?","Denise Morrison","","Chris, to answer your question, there is no change in our expectations on the acquisitions. The reason why we lowered it was because two thirds of it came from the soup business and about one third from Pepperidge Farm.","Chris Growe - Stifel","","Okay. And I guess related to that, in this quarter, you had an increase in promotion and you didn\u2019t get the response that you expected. I am just curious, is that a comment about the category or a comment about the consumer in terms of them not --somewhat not responding to the increase in promotional spending, what do you think happened there I guess is my question?","Denise Morrison","","It\u2019s a great question, and I have actually looked at the performance of 36 Simple Meals now over the course of time. And if you look at the MULO, total refrigerated meals are up 3.3%, shelf-stable are up 0.7%, and frozen are down 0.6%. So what\u2019s happening is the refrigerated simple meals are experiencing most of the growth, but within shelf-stable there are some categories like fresh bread and rolls, Italian and Mexican sauces, which are positive and soup is slightly declining. And so, if you look at it over the last year, the total Simple Meals category is sluggish, up 1.2%, that is still positive, so we feel like we are tracking right with the pack here, it\u2019s just that the environment is tough.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay, thank you for the time.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thank you, Chris. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi, thank you. Denise, I guess we weren\u2019t modeling very much growth in soup in the quarter merely because the comp was so hard. It was a 14% comp, but it look like your business plans really did depend on a lot of volume growth on top of what last year was, a lot of volume growth. So what made you think that in this consumer environment and then in a tight inventory environment at retail, were the plans that robust that that was possible, I guess?","Denise Morrison","We got off to a to a slow start in the first quarter and we deployed extra promotional activity into the third quarter beyond what we had last year. And in addition, we introduced eight new SKUs of soup in January, which was something we don\u2019t usually do, but we felt that they were ready and we could use the sales volume to bring us out of the first quarter slump.","Quite frankly, it was -- we were happy that we at least held our own versus the 14%, and over a two-year period, we were up high-single digit in soup except that it just wasn\u2019t enough to meet the expectations that we needed to bring the quarter end and bring our full year in on our guidance. So, that's the best explanation. Anthony you want to add..?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I would just add one point that I think is important is on soup, we held our promotional price points, and what we did is we expanded to a broader customer base, so we went to customers this year that we didn't promote with in the third quarter last year, which gave us some confidence that we thought would get a volume lift.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","So more customers got the deals, I got it. Any implications for pricing for next year, I know that some of your commodities are up, have you announced any pricing for soup?","Anthony DiSilvestro","No, we haven't announced any pricing for soup.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning everybody.","Denise Morrison","Hi Eric.","Jennifer Driscoll","Good morning.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","I guess, Denise I want to focus in on the Global Snacking and Baking area. I looked back and I had to go back to, I think 2009 to see a quarterly profit that was this week in between Arnott's and Pepperidge. I know that both of those businesses especially on the cracker side at Pepperidge and the core Arnott's business are very, very profitable. So, I'm really worried that those businesses are starting to roll over at the same time that you have continued to have challenges in other areas. I mean why should not we be particularly concerned of what do you see is the problem for Pepperidge, and how can we have faith that that business isn\u2019t going to be drag versus competition, but maybe better or stronger competition in coming quarters?","Denise Morrison","First let me address Pepperidge Farm. In Pepperidge Farm, we had positive profits and the profits are actually pretty robust. The two portions of the business that had sales decline were adult savory crackers and frozen, which are actually a small portion of the business. In addition, the Goldfish, we had a price increase on Goldfish last year and we've found that given the competitive environment we had to promote that product more in the third quarter. We did see with improving as the quarter went on. So we do believe that Pepperidge Farm still a great business and really good shape.","When it comes to Arnott's, we've been dealing with a very tough retailer environment in Australia and we have had to invest in that business to stabilize it and return advertising to our core brands like Tim Tam, Shapes and real stock.","So we have had cost that hits in Australia, we recognize that. And but we believe that getting that business back to stability is important, it\u2019s an important business for us. These are great brands and they have great expansion possibilities as demonstrated by our double-digit growth in Indonesia. So I hope that answers your question.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Well I will pass it on. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Denise Morrison","","Good morning.","Anthony DiSilvestro","","Good morning.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Denise or Anthony, you're in obviously in the midst of integrating a number of acquisitions rate now but given that the M&A environment seems to be heating up a bit. Just want to revisit where you see yourself in this process of portfolio transformation? How you\u2019d assess the landscape right now and how you would balance that with addressing some of the base business issues, and to the base business trends having been below your expectations year-to-date reinforce the urgency of needing to evolve the portfolio faster?","Denise Morrison","Well, we\u2019ve always held ourselves to a standard since the very beginning of strengthening our core business, while we expand into faster growing spaces. And we will continue to do both of those. We have been making plans and investments in our core business and these three acquisitions that we made have been very, very good for our portfolio and yes we will continue to look for other acquisitions with smart external development that make good strategic sense.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you Denise.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Driscoll - Citi","Great, thank you. Good morning.","Denise Morrison","Good morning.","Anthony DiSilvestro","","Good morning.","David Driscoll - Citi","Anthony I just want to make sure I\u2019ve heard something right, it\u2019s a clarification, on the admin expense line I think you just quantified that incentive compensation for the full year was down about $0.08 or $40 million, first off did I get that right?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. What I said is our incentive compensation relative to targeted levels is $0.08 favorable.","David Driscoll - Citi","That\u2019s what I meant but that was much better said, so thank you. And then the big question then is on 2015 you\u2019re saying that got to get restored and so that something like a three percentage point headwind and then from the 53rd week itself there is another I think like two percentage point headwind. So kind of out of the gate with no other information there is sort of a 5 percentage point headwind against [F \u201815] numbers that we can state is there today, is that fair and accurate?","Anthony DiSilvestro","","Well actually, it\u2019s 1 point worse than you stated, it\u2019s EBIT at 3 point for each of them.","David Driscoll - Citi","","Okay.","Anthony DiSilvestro","","Because as I said, 53rd week is 2 points at sales and 3 points at EBIT. I mean going the other way, we\u2019ve got a couple of things, so we are wrapping the Plum Organics to recall and we\u2019re wrapping a very disruptive winter. We know we have some challenges next year. We\u2019re working through our plans now in terms of operating plans for next year to see where we come at.","David Driscoll - Citi","Okay, thank you for that. It seems the implications are clear on that issue. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","","You are welcome. Next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Ken Goldman - JP Morgan","","Hi, can you hear me?","Jennifer Driscoll","","Yes, hi Ken.","Ken Goldman - JP Morgan","","Okay. Hi guys. One really quick one, then my question, first how much does 4Q guidance incorporate an expectation of an inventory draw down? And then my longer question, can you update us on your expectations for the California drought for fiscal \u201815? I know you won\u2019t give specific guidance there but any directional help or thoughts on the situation given how poor it is right might useful. Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","","I can take the first, inventory part of that. We did end the quarter about $25 million up versus a year ago on soup inventories. It\u2019s hard to predict exactly what is going to come out as we launch into next year but our forecast for the fourth quarter does assume the majority of that inventory comes out.","Denise Morrison","","Okay. And regarding the drought, we have held our own pretty much during this drought. Our Bolthouse Farms carrot business resides in fields with aquifers and they have been growing also in Northern California and some other regions to take some of the pressure off. So they have been doing well despite the situation. We are expecting some increases in tomato prices as a result of the drought but that is been incorporated in our planning.","Ken Goldman - JP Morgan","Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys.","Denise Morrison","Good morning.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","If you were to separate your business drivers and controllables like your marketing and innovation, and the factors outside your control in fiscal \u201814 like the consumer environment, whether disruption, and even factors like the competition you are seeing in healthy snacking, do you see the net impact of the uncontrollables in fiscal \u201814 as perhaps unusual as a way -- in a way that creates easy or difficult comparison as we think about fiscal \u201815?","Denise Morrison","The only thing that I can say is that we were -- the sales were below our expectation by about a percentage point. Some of that was controllable and that the promotions didn\u2019t get the lift that we wanted. But then you could argue that one of the reasons why we didn\u2019t get the lifts because of a harsher environment and a more cautious consumer. So I am not sure how to accurately piece that out.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I think there is a couple of things to point out; obviously one, we wrapping the Plum issue, so that obviously is a non-controllable that will go away; we expect improved performance in Pepperidge Farm. Denise mentioned, we got a two parts of that business that are hurting this year which are small portion that\u2019s adult savory cracker business and the frozen business. And I think more fundamentally and we\u2019ve talked about the need to improve our performance in U.S. Beverages and in Arnott\u2019s which have been a drag on the portfolio of this year and we need to turn that around.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you very much.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning everyone.","Denise Morrison","Hi Alexia.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. There was some data around [share trends] in U.S. soup suggesting that over the last year you have been losing out? Who is to losing share to, is it your chief competitor or is it other niche brand that\u2019s clearly not private label? And what do you think you might need to do differently to address that? Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","There has been, if you look at there has been some share gains by some of the niche brands. And I think if you look as to why that is, there are some pockets of growth within the category around things like organic, and health and wellness attributes. And obviously we're looking at those things. We've got a pretty robust plan for soup for next year and some exciting things going on. And we plan to share that more fully with you at our Investor Day in July.","Denise Morrison","When you look at share of Simple Meals, we definitely are holding our own against other peers in the [south] or at least -- so even though Simple Meals is only up slightly, we have maintained our share of that.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erin Lash with Morningstar. Your line is open.","Erin Lash - Morningstar","Thank you for taking my question.","Denise Morrison","You're welcome.","Erin Lash - Morningstar","I wanted some additional detail, I\u2019m hoping you could give some additional details regarding the new products that you\u2019ve been bringing to market and how those are either resonating relative to plan and what potentially you can do differently if you can address that? I know this is something you are going to talk about at the Analyst Day, but any additional insight you might have would be helpful.","Denise Morrison","Okay. I think that we\u2019ve had some really good performance from our new dinner sauce products. We started building a new platform, which was completely disruptive with our first execution of Skillet Sauces last year, we added new Slow Cooker Sauces to that and then next year, we're adding new Oven Sauces. And we've been successful in getting a destination set in the stores to give the consumer a specific place to shop for these sauces.","I think one of the reasons why they're doing well is because obviously they're consumed with meat and fresh food and so refining a lot of home preparation these days. So those have done very well. Goldfish Puffs have done really well and are meeting our expectations. Not so well are the where the Pepperidge Farm Cracker Chips and Jingos, which is one of the things that we're cycling in that business this year, but we have reformulated the cracker chips and have better expectations for those going forward.","Erin Lash - Morningstar","What about within soups specifically?","Denise Morrison","","In soups, yes most of the innovation has been sustaining innovation; the new Plum inspired Chunky soups are doing really well, the broth is doing phenomenal where we've moved from just chicken, beef and vegetable into more flavor, flavorful broths with recipes to go along with that. So and then the new eight SKUs that we introduced in January or performing as expected.","Erin Lash - Morningstar","Thank you. That's helpful.","Jennifer Driscoll","","You're welcome. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Hey. Good morning folks. Thanks for taking the question. Denise, a high level, you\u2019re reallocating money into trade promo, auto marketing, you\u2019re not alone; the entire industry has been moving this way over the last few years. And as we do this, we just see promotional efficacy continue to step lower and lower and lower. We\u2019re not really dealing with expandable consumption categories here. So, at what point do we say enough is enough; quit trying to throw money at this? And is there a path on the horizon to actually get this money back out? It\u2019s a lot easier to pour money into trade; it\u2019s a lot harder to retract it once retailers have their hands on it.","Denise Morrison","Yes. We are continuing to work with all of the levers of drivers of demand which vary by business. And we are working as well with customers for more trade promotion effectiveness. And our business leaders need to be flexible to make course corrections along the way both to capitalize on opportunities or meet competition. And in several of these categories we\u2019ve seen a ramp up of competition. What we\u2019ve tried to do is increase our frequency, not go into deep discounting.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Going back on a couple more tactical themes, Arnott\u2019s; it was my view coming to this year that this should be a year of profit recovery as you implement the automation and your manufacturing network in the market. Based on results, it looks like all those savings are -- in summer being ploughed back into the market. Is that indeed the case?","Anthony DiSilvestro","That\u2019s primarily the case but one point I would add, we experienced some delays in achieving those savings, so we didn\u2019t get the full amount of savings in the year so that should help us going into next year.","Denise Morrison","And I think the other thing I would add is we\u2019ve completely changed the team in Australia and they have a new plan that they\u2019re implementing which has caused calling for investment particularly in the power brands and we believe that\u2019s the right thing to do for that business right now.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Makes sense and last one and I will pass it on. Encouraging to see North America food service volume return to growth I know you brought on some new capacity, new technology for you late last year, is much of that been deployed yet?","Anthony DiSilvestro","","I would say some of it\u2019s been deployed, the major driver of the improvement in North America Food Service is actually been our traditional up and down the street food service business.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Got it, okay thanks a lot guys, I will pass it on.","Jennifer Driscoll","","Okay, next question please.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","","Good morning.","Denise Morrison","","Good morning, Diane.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","","Hey I wanted to sort of follow on Eric\u2019s question earlier about the baking, just more broadly could you talk a little bit about your viewpoint on snacking? It seems like Pepperidge Farm is one of those brands where you would think it was strong enough to sort of carry a volume lift and yet you continue to see sort of a move away from sort of grain based products due to shifts in your consumer diet, so could a little bit more broadly about snacking and sort of carbs versus protein and what you are seeing with the consumer base please? Thank you.","Denise Morrison","","I mean there is no question that within snacking we have seen and I am talking about macro snacking, we have seen brands in the [better for you] space gaining traction, one of the reasons why we introduced Goldfish puffs in addition to attracting teens and twins into the Goldfish franchise was that we were able to make that product free. So, we are participating in that macro snacking at this point. I do believe though that our cookie business and our Pepperidge Farm cracker business particularly Goldfish do have a nice loyal consumer base and we will continue to innovate in that space as well. So, our model is to give consumers choices depending upon what they are seeking to buy.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","Okay, all right, thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","And our last question will be from Akshay I think.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Perfect. So one quick one on the financials, just can you update us on your gross margin expectation now? I know you have come in below what you were projecting at the beginning of the year. Can you help us with the drivers of that? It seems like promotional costs and volumes have come in sort of lower than expected, but maybe give us a sense of where the commodity outlook is and if it has changed. And then more importantly just on Bolthouse, you did see 6% growth but my expectation there is that longer term that\u2019s 8% to 10% top line grower and margins should be expanding. So, can you help us just understand the performance this quarter, especially at the margin level on Bolthouse that came in, well below what I was expecting? Thanks.","Anthony DiSilvestro","So I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on your gross margin more about where we have been then the outlook for next year. But in terms of this year, we expect cost inflation, the rate to go up about 3% to 4%; inside of that ingredients, packaging and energy inflation running about 2% to 3% and then you need to add a point for the supply chain issues that I\u2019ve mentioned earlier.","If you step back and look at the base business, our gross margin declined. As I said in my comments 60 basis points of that is the impact of the acquisitions and 1 point, 2 points is the base business. You are right, promotional variance is a significant factor in that in addition to the inflation that I talked about. We've increased our promotional spending in our Baking and Snacking business and in U.S. Soup. And we've also increased trade promotion in Bolthouse Farms, which is one of the reasons you are seeing a lower gross margin or a lower margin in Bolthouse because in addition to the advertising spend to build the brand awareness, the competitiveness in that category has intensified of late and then we have increased our trade spending in response. We don't expect it to be an ongoing issue, but it did impact the third quarter, both the top-line and the bottom-line for Bolthouse.","Denise Morrison","And Bolthouse year-to-date is up about 7% and the beverages and salad dressings are up double digits, both in sales and also in consumption and the carrots are low single digits.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Perfect.

","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ken Gosnell, Vice President, Finance Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Ken Gosnell","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the third quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2018. With me here in New Jersey are Keith McLoughlin, interim CEO; and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media, who'll participate in a listen-only mode. ","Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. ","Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Keith.","Keith McLoughlin","Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. My name is Keith McLoughlin, the new interim CEO of Campbell Soup company and a board member since 2016. Thank you for joining our third quarter conference call today. ","As you have seen from this morning's press release, we announced that Denise Morrison has chosen to retire after 15 years with the company, having served the last 7 years as President and CEO. I'd like to start by thanking Denise for her leadership and dedication to Campbell. ","Denise repositioned our portfolio toward the faster-growing snacking and health and well-being categories with important acquisitions like Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods. It has indeed been a pleasure working with her as a board member over the last few years. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire management team, we thank Denise and wish her all the very best. ","Let me just start out by describing how we'll handle the call today. I'll make a few brief opening comments, and then our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro, will review in detail the financial results, the updated guidance, and he will answer your questions. After the Q&A, I'll make some closing remarks, and we'll end the call on time by 9:30. ","Let me start by describing my role. As interim CEO, my mandate from the board is clear: one, to lead the company, along with the Campbell's leadership team, until the board appoints the new chief; and two, to get the performance back on track for the company by conducting a thorough review of our strategic and operating plans, the composition of our entire portfolio and the associated allocation of our resources, capital cost and people. All this work will be under the advisement and supervision of the board. We, of course, will conduct this work with rigor, objectivity and urgency. ","As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we delivered results that were below expectations, ours and yours. Our company has clearly faced challenges. Some of those are external factors that are impacting the entire industry, and others stem from our execution. As a board member and interim CEO, these results are unsatisfactory and disappointing to us as well as our shareholders. ","I've been on the Board of Directors for almost 3 years now and know Campbell well. It's a great company with talented employees and a portfolio of leading brands across multiple categories. Brands such as Pepperidge Farms, Campbell, Swanson, Arnott's, V8, Prego, Pace, Plum and Kelsen are tremendous assets for this corporation. The recent addition of the Snyder's-Lance portfolio of brands and Pacific Foods, both of which I strongly supported, will enhance our growth potential as we expand into the faster-growing snacking categories and enhance our health and well-being offerings of soup and broth. ","This company has and will continue to have a strong commitment to all of its stakeholders, including consumers, customers, employees and shareholders. We remain committed to bringing high-quality, differentiated products to the market at the right price and supporting our brands with compelling marketing and broad availability. These commitments will not change. ","Additionally, our core values will not change. Our values around operating with integrity and ethics, treating all people with dignity and respect and operating the safety and sustainability remain steadfast. What must change and will change is our execution and our financial performance. Our mandate is to create long-term value for our shareholders. We intend to take appropriate and decisive actions to ensure that Campbell is positioned to compete and win in the marketplace. That means we must take a fresh look at our strategies, our operations and our portfolio and to do so with urgency. ","Toward that end, beginning today, we will undertake a thorough and critical review of all aspects of our strategic and operating plans, including the composition of our entire portfolio. That work will inform our capital allocation and resource deployment priorities. Everything is on the table. There are no sacred cows. We expect this process to take a few months, and we intend to share the progress of this review with you during our fourth quarter call at the end of August. ","While we are unable to share a detailed plan today, we do anticipate that the combination of persistent headwinds, the issues we're facing and the possibility of stepped-up investment spending will make fiscal 2019 a challenging year. Looking ahead, I'm confident that this company has a bright future. We have powerful and relevant brands, enviable products and market positions, strong cash flow and committed and talented people. ","Under the leadership of our newly appointed Chief Operating Officer, Luca Mignini, our global biscuits and snacks business has delivered consistent top and bottom line growth. As we successfully integrate Snyder's-Lance and capture the synergies, build a large and differentiated snacking business and improve the performance of the balance of the portfolio, we will deliver consistent profitable growth, which will create value for our shareholders. ","We recognize, of course, that you may have questions about the portfolio review that's underway. However, we will not be able to add any additional details at this time as we have just begun, and we're not in a position to speculate on any aspect of it. I look forward to sharing our plan with you on our fourth quarter call on August 30. ","I now will turn it over to Anthony, who will review the results, and then be available to take your questions. Anthony?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks, Keith, and good morning. I'd first like to welcome Keith to his new role. I've known Keith since he joined the Campbell board in 2016, and I look forward to working with him. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and revised 2018 guidance. In the quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. This is our largest acquisition ever, and it will meaningfully shift our portfolio towards the faster-growing snacking categories. On a pro forma basis, snacking will become almost 1\/2 of our portfolio of sales. ","The consumer takeaway performance on the core Snyder's-Lance brands looks good, and the teams are working well together. We remain confident in our ability to deliver the targeted $295 million in cost savings and synergies. The work performed since the acquisition closed has confirmed our initial synergy assumptions, and we are making good progress putting in place detailed plans to deliver cost synergies. While our organic sales were stable in a difficult environment, our challenge in the quarter was clearly our adjusted gross margin performance, as the percentage declined by about 4 points compared to last year, including a 1 point negative mix impact from our recent acquisitions. Gross margin performance was driven by higher-than-expected cost inflation, primarily higher transportation and logistic costs, higher supply chain costs in Campbell Fresh and increased promotional spending in U.S. Soup and Pepperidge Farms. ","As a result of the disappointing Campbell Fresh performance, we revised the long-term forecast for that business, and we recorded a $619 million pretax noncash impairment charge in our GAAP results. We are all disappointed with the results of C-Fresh, and we acknowledge that they are unacceptable. ","We continue to make progress on our multi-year cost-savings program. We generated $25 million of savings in the quarter, bringing the program to date total to $390 million. Our success in realizing these savings gives us further confidence in our ability to achieve the Snyder's synergies. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect lower expectation for gross margin performance, with the 2 primary drivers being the performance of Campbell Fresh and the inflationary impact of higher transportation and logistics costs. We're also including the impact of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition in the guidance, which, as we expected, is dilutive to adjusted EPS in the 4 months of ownership in fiscal 2018. ","While we are very confident in our ability to deliver targeted cost synergies and the overall acquisition economics, we have uncovered some short-term issues, which I'll discuss. At the end of my presentation, I will comment on our plan to address the company's financial and operating challenges, our portfolio of businesses and projected financial performance. ","Now I'll review our third quarter results in more detail. For the third quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis increased 15% to $2,125,000,000. Excluding a 14-point benefit from the acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods and a 1-point benefit from currency translation, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year, as gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh were offset by declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter increased 1% to $308 million. Excluding the impact of the Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods acquisitions, adjusted EBIT declined 6%, primarily due to lower gross margin performance, partly offset by lower adjusted administrative expenses and lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses. ","Adjusted EPS increased 19% or $0.11 to $0.70 per share, reflecting a favorable tax timing benefit, partly offset by higher adjusted interest expense attributable to both the Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods acquisitions. Through the first three quarters ending April, as-reported net sales increased 4%, and organic net sales declined by 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT decreased 7% to $1,127,000,000. Excluding the impact of the recent acquisitions, adjusted EBIT decreased 8%, and adjusted EPS of $2.62 was up 4%. ","Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Organic net sales were comparable to last year, as volume gains were offset by increased promotional spending. Overall, promotion -- promotional spending rates increased in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, driven by U.S. Soup, and in Global Biscuits and Snacks, reflecting increased spending behind Goldfish crackers. ","There was a positive impact in currency translation of 1%, principally the Australian and Canadian dollars. The recent addition of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods to the portfolio added 14 percentage points, bringing our as-reported sales increase versus the prior year to 15%. ","Our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased 390 basis points in the quarter, falling short of our expectations from a combination of declines in the base business and the mixed impact of acquisitions. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 320 basis points. Over 2\/3 of that was cost inflation, which, on a rate basis, increased 4.5%, reflecting higher prices on dairy, meat, steel cans and aluminum as well as the higher-than-anticipated escalation of transportation and logistics costs. ","The remaining decline was driven by higher supply chain costs in Campbell Fresh and investments associated with our real food initiative. These negative drivers were partly offset by benefits from our cost-savings initiatives. ","With gross margins below the Campbell average, the addition of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods to the portfolio decreased gross margins by 1.1 points. We fully expect that the margins of these businesses will increase over time, as we integrate them into Campbell and achieve synergies. The higher promotional spending in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks, that I previously mentioned, had a negative impact of 60 basis points. Mix had a slightly negative impact of 30 basis points. ","Lastly, our supply chain productivity program, which is incremental to our cost-savings program, contributed 130 basis points of margin improvement. All-in, our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased 390 basis points to 32%. ","Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 8% in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions, partly offset by the benefits from our cost-saving initiatives. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 6% to $127 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and benefit cost, partly offset by the impact of recent acquisitions. ","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.11 from $0.59 in the prior year quarter to $0.70 per share in the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted EBIT had a $0.01 impact in EPS, as the benefit from the recent acquisitions was partly offset by EBIT decline on the base business. ","Adjusted net interest expense increased by $32 million, a $0.07 negative impact to EPS, driven by an increase in the debt level, funding our recent acquisitions and reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. ","Our adjusted EPS results are benefiting by $0.17 from a lower adjusted effective tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter declined by about 20 percentage points to 15.3%, driven by the favorable timing of tax expense on an adjusted basis in Q3 related to the impairment charges, which we expect will reverse in Q4. ","Benefiting from share repurchases in prior periods, a lower share count added a $0.01 benefit to EPS. And lastly, currency translation had no impact on EPS, completing the bridge to $0.70 per share. Although not shown on the chart, the Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods acquisitions in aggregate had a negative EPS impact of approximately $0.03. ","Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales declined 2%, driven primarily by declines in V8 beverages, Plum Organics and U.S. Soup. Excluding the benefit of the acquisition of Pacific Foods, sales of U.S. Soup declined 1%, driven by declines in condensed soups, partly offset by gains in broth and ready-to-serve soups. As expected, we are seeing improved sales performance in U.S. Soup relative to the first half. ","Segment operating earnings declined 3% in the quarter to $217 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage, partly offset by lower administrative expenses and lower marketing and selling expenses. Segment gross margin performance continued to be impacted by higher transportation and logistics cost and from the negative mix impact of adding Pacific Foods to the portfolio. ","Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our shared results as measured by IRI. Our results are shown on a pro forma basis, including the recently acquired Pacific Foods business. For the 52-week period ending April 29, 2018, the category continued to show growth, increasing 130 basis points. However, our sales in measured channels declined 1.9%. We had a 59.5% market share for the 52-week period, down 2 points from a year ago. Our consumption and share decline are attributable to our performance with a key customer, which we've previously discussed. ","Private label grew share by 140 basis points, primarily reflecting gains in broth, finishing at 15.3%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 25.2%, increasing 60 basis points. In Global Biscuits and Snacks, sales were $862 million in the quarter, including $207 million from Snyder's-Lance. Excluding the benefit of the acquisition and favorable currency translation, organic sales increased 1%, driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm Snacks, reflecting continued growth in Goldfish crackers as well as in cookies, driven by gains in Farmhouse and Milano. ","Segment operating earnings increased 23% to $123 million, primarily driven by the benefit of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, segment earnings grew modestly. In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales increased 1% to $251 million, driven primarily by gains in refrigerated soup. Sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages were comparable to the prior year. The segment had an operating loss of $19 million in the quarter compared to earnings of $1 million in the prior year. ","The earnings decline was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage, reflecting lower manufacturing efficiencies and reduced carrot crop yields as well as cost inflation, including significantly higher transportation and logistics cost. The earnings performance of Campbell Fresh is significantly below our expectations as our gross margin has been impacted by the factors I listed. As a result of the performance of Bolthouse Farms CPG and the anticipated loss of private label refrigerated soup contact with certain customers, we performed interim impairment assessment on the Bolthouse Farms CPG business and the daily reporting unit, which includes our fresh soup and Garden Fresh Gourmet businesses. In our GAAP results and within corporate, we recorded pretax noncash impairment charges totaling $619 million or $1.65 per share, reflecting our reduced expectation for current and future earnings and cash flows. ","On a company-wide basis, cash from operations increased slightly to $1,024,000,000 compared to $1,011,000,000 in 2017, as higher cash earnings, benefiting from U.S. tax reform, were partly offset by a slight increase in working capital requirements. Capital expenditures were $223 million, $28 million higher than the prior year, reflecting investments to support our cost-saving initiatives. We paid dividends totaling $321 million compared to $314 million in 2017, reflecting the 12% increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced in September of fiscal 2017. In aggregate, we repurchased $86 million of shares on a year-to-date basis, $75 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. With the acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance, we have suspended our share repurchases and did not make any share repurchases in the third quarter. ","Net debt of $9.6 billion is up from $3.1 billion a year ago, reflecting the impact of the $6.1 billion acquisition of Snyder's-Lance and the $700 million acquisition of Pacific Foods, partly offset by positive cash flow from the base business. As we've stated before, our priority is to delever the balance sheet following the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. Now I'll review our revised 2018 guidance. As shown, we have isolated changes on our base business from the impact of now including the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. I'll start with the sales line. On the base business, we're raising the low end of the sales range, which is now 0% to plus 1%. The acquisition of Snyder's-Lance adds 9 to 10 points of sale, bringing the new range for our sales guidance to plus 10% to plus 11% compared to 2017. ","Due to lower expectations for gross margin performance, which I'll discuss in a moment, we now expect adjusted EBIT, in aggregate, to decline by minus 8% to minus 6%, which, relative to our previous guidance, reflects a 4-point reduction on the base business, partly offset by a 3-point contribution from the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. We now expect adjusted EPS to decline by minus 6% to minus 5%, implying a range of $2.85 to $2.90. This includes a forecasted decline on the base of minus 3% to minus 1%, 5 points below our previous guidance and a $0.10 per share negative impact from the Snyder's-Lance acquisition for the 4 months of ownership in 2018. The Snyder's-Lance estimate includes the ongoing impact of purchase accounting and the incremental interest expense associated with funding the transaction. ","Given the changes to our outlook, I'll provide a recap of the key assumptions. Our expectation for cost inflation for the year on a rate basis has increased to approximately 4%, reflecting unanticipated increases in transportation and logistics cost. We continue to expect to generate ongoing supply chain productivity gains, excluding the benefit of our cost-savings program, of approximately 3% of cost of products sold. And against our cost-savings program, we expect to deliver $75 million to $85 million of cost savings, most of which will impact costs. We now expect our adjusted gross margin percentage to decline by approximately 3 percentage points, with 1 point attributable to the mix impact of our recent acquisitions and about two points from declines on the base business. ","The decline in the base business is attributable to three drivers. The underperformance of Campbell Fresh represents about half of the decline, with a balanced split between the higher-than-expected transportation and logistics costs and slightly higher promotional spending. Below the line, our adjusted interest expense is now expected to increase to a range of $220 million to $225 million, including the impact of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. We now expect our adjusted tax rate, which has benefited from U.S. tax reform, to be in the range of 26% to 27% in 2018, slightly higher than our prior forecast. ","The rate forecast also implies a reversal of the Q3 timing benefit in the fourth quarter. This guidance assumes that the impact of currency translation will be slightly positive. We are now forecasting capital expenditures of approximately $440 million, which is an increase from the previous outlook, reflecting spending for the four-month period on Snyder's-Lance. ","Lastly, I will update you on our 2019 outlook for Snyder's-Lance. We've owned the business for about 8 weeks, and we remain very optimistic about the long-term potential of the Snyder's-Lance business. Our initial work has confirmed the cost and synergy opportunity, and our long-term financial expectations for this business, including the 2021 EPS accretion, have not changed. That being said, there are several issues we have uncovered, which will impact fiscal 2019. These include a higher-than-expected trade rate, as the company's plan for price realization did not materialize; the impact of higher freight and transportation costs that we're all experiencing; and from higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the relocation and startup of nut-production equipment. ","While we believe these issues are addressable, we now expect the Snyder's-Lance acquisition will be modestly dilutive to our 2019 adjusted earnings per share. As I said before, we remain confident that this acquisition will create shareholder value. Before wrapping up, I have a few additional comments on what you should expect from us going forward. As Keith stated, we are not satisfied with our performance and with our expectations for 2018. We know that things must change to drive the performance our shareholders expect from Campbell. We are facing both execution-related and external challenges. ","We are analyzing these issues in depth, developing action plans to address them and doing so with a heightened sense of urgency. In addition, we are going to undertake a strategic review of the businesses and brands within our portfolio. On our Q4 earnings call, we intend to share a comprehensive plan and timetable to address the company's challenges and opportunities. On that call, we will also provide our financial guidance for 2019. At this stage, given what we know about accelerating cost inflation, in part due to the anticipated impact of import tariffs and the continuing headwind on transportation and logistics cost, we expect our margins will be down in fiscal 2019. ","We are being tough-minded and realistic about where we are today and what needs to be done to improve the business. That said, we remain very optimistic about Campbell's long-term potential. We believe there is a clear path to improve financial performance as we strengthen our terrific snacking platform through the integration of Snyder's-Lance, improve our performance in soup and address our challenges in Campbell Fresh. And at our Investor Day on October 3, we will share more details of our business unit plan for fiscal 2019 as well as our longer-term plans for 2020 and beyond. We look forward to communicating in more depth in August and October. ","Before we go to Q&A, Keith and I want to acknowledge that you are likely to have questions about the strategic review we are undertaking. Similarly, we are sure that you are aware that it is not in our best interest to engage in speculative what-if questions or hypothetical scenarios. So please note that we chose our words carefully this morning, and we will not have much to add on this topic until we get back to you on August 30. ","With that, I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session with Anthony. [Operator Instructions]. Okay, Crystal.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","I just wanted to ask -- just a clarification and then a question. Anthony, in the comment you made about margins being down in 2019, is that both the base business so before the acquisition and then the dilutive impact of the acquisition? Or is it -- just want to make sure that we're understanding that -- whether it's the base will be down and then the acquisition is also dilutive to margins.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. It's actually both, Bryan. The comments primarily relate to what we're seeing on the base business and the impact of cost inflation that we foresee continuing. And also, in the first year, when we add Snyder's-Lance to the portfolio, the mix impact will also have a negative impact on margin.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then just a question on as you're going through strategic review, as we're thinking about the debt that you've just taken on to acquire Lance, is there anything in the terms of your those debt -- in the terms of the debt that you've taken on that provides any limitations to whatever you may contemplate doing in terms of the portfolio? I'm just trying to understand how much flexibility you may or may not have given the debt you've just taken on.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. There's only one small piece of the average financing that has a covenant in it, but we're well below that. And anything we do, I don't think that will be an issue whatsoever.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","My question is going to be about pricing. And if you expect any incremental pricing to help, I guess, cover some of the inflation headwinds in fiscal '19. And I asked that partly because of just some of the concerns around the industry's ability to get that in this environment and then also more specifically, because of the comment you made around Lance. And I think the increased trade rate because of some pricing that I think you said did not materialize. So perhaps you can roll that up into your anticipation around incremental pricing, particularly in light of also the promotional spending in soup that transpired as you kind of got back into promotional activity with a key customer.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Sure. I mean, I guess the problem starts with the forecast that we're seeing for an acceleration in cost inflation and part of that due to the impact of upcoming tariff. So we see pretty significant increases on steel and aluminum and other parts of the commodity basket, things like wheat, resins. Corrugated is another area where we see some increases. So that's obviously going to put some pressure on the margin. And obviously, the question is what is the impact of potential pricing to help to offset that. I don't have a lot of details for you today on that. What I will say, and as you know, it's a very challenging environment out there today. It's a competitive retailer market, and we're all mindful of that. That being said, it would certainly be our intention that, over time, productivity and pricing will offset cost inflation. The challenge is the timing. The other thing that we do and working on is the impact of our cost-savings program to help offset some of that. So as we've done in the past, we do have the 3% annual cost-productivity program coming out of the supply chain. We're also making progress against our targeted $500 million of cost savings by 2020. Our recent decision to close our Toronto manufacturing operations is a good example and relocating most of that production to our U.S. thermal plants. So we're doing all we can to offset the inflationary impact. But as we rack it all up, we do see pressure on the margins going into 2019.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman","Two from me, if I may. I'm curious about, Keith, the board's search for the next CEO, how that process begins for you as a board really, even goes what the portfolio will look like, what are the challenges involved with that and also really, which qualities you're looking for in the next CEO. I know you talked about some things that are nonnegotiable, such as ethics and so forth. But any color you can give in terms of the kind of person that would be right for the company at this time? And then I guess my second question is on the dividend, and I'm just curious what the board's thoughts are on maintaining that with or without the strategic review.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Ken, I'm going to take that. Given this is Keith's first day, he's not going to participate in the Q&A session. But with respect to the dividend, 2 things I can say. We have a well-articulated priority for the uses of cash. It starts with reinvesting in our business and capital expenditures. Second is the dividend. And third, in the current environment, is to reduce leverage by paying down the debt. We have a robust and significant cash flow, which we fully expect we will continue to maintain a competitive dividend level and to have that dividend increase over time with earnings. So I think the management team as well as the board certainly supports the continued payment of a competitive dividend, and we see nothing that we're looking at that would change that at all.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer","Keith mentioned a need to rebase earnings further in fiscal 2019, and you added some comments about freight cost and trade rate. And obviously, this talks to the push and pull of cost versus pricing power. But I think long term, there's still that question in -- of the company's ability to meaningfully drive a profitable growth. And so in what areas do you envision Campbell perhaps spending more or executing differently to really promote a more balanced profitable growth? And does -- is there spending in fiscal '19 going towards that and not just essentially rebasing in light of your pricing net of commodities?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I mean, it's a bit premature, again, into too much detail around 2019. But you kind of hinted that the exact idea of the review and what's going to come out of it is a clear articulation of those things we need to do to reposition the company to drive long-term and profitable growth. And as I think about it, we have some great examples within our portfolio. And I think it exemplifies what a branded food company needs to do to deliver. And that's having a product quality that's superior to competition; continuing to innovate in the marketplace; appropriately managing the price gaps, the competition and private label; supporting those brands with compelling advertising and at a competitive level. I think when we do that, it's a win-win-win. It's a win for our consumers, our customers and for us. And I would say a brand like Prego is a good example where we've been able to do that and grow consumption and share. On the other hand, our broth business is a category we haven't done that, and private label has gained some share. So I think if we undertake the review, we're going to look at the portfolio. We're going to look at what got us into this situation and what do we need to change the long-term trajectory of sales and earnings. Because we believe we can do it, and we're optimistic that there is a positive long-term financial performance that will come out of that.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi.","David Driscoll","So I wanted to -- I have two questions. I'd like to just start off and say, is it fair to say that the bulk of the problems today are C-Fresh-related as it was by far the largest negative variance versus our expectations? And you tick off so many factors, guys, I feel like sometimes it's -- the importance of the different ones is not that clear to people listening to the call. So just number one, can you confirm that my comment, that C-Fresh was the biggest negative variance, is accurate? And then critically here, why are the supply chain fixes not working? Campbell has put an amazing amount of effort and time into getting the supply chain right at C-Fresh. And it just feels like we just keep hearing problems. What's wrong with the supply chain at C-Fresh?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. So the first part, just to give the overall context and dimensionalize the C-Fresh issue. So if I go back to where we started the year in terms of our gross margin expectations and where we are now, so we're a couple of points below where we started. Half of that is the situation at Campbell Fresh. And I mean, certainly we face significant challenges there, and the return to profitability has proven certainly more challenging than we anticipated. And I think the situation which we need to analyze further in the fourth quarter, it goes beyond supply chain. We're seeing low crop yields on carrots. We're seeing lower manufacturing yields. We're seeing higher cost inflation in things like transportation and logistics. We've had to go to co-packers, and those are more expensive. The one thing that's actually mitigating some of these issues is the benefit of the productivity program that our supply chain has brought to bear. But unfortunately, it hasn't done enough to offset the other issue. So we're going to take a step back. We're going to do a deeper dive in the fourth quarter and look at the drivers of that performance and figure out what do we do going forward with respect to the Campbell Fresh business.","David Driscoll","And then just one follow-up, Anthony. The factors -- could you be more clear about the factors in '19? I know you're not giving guidance. But I don't like when we get just a couple of negatives, and we don't get enough to understand what you're trying to tell us here on F '19. You have tax benefits that come in, in the first portion of '19. So it's not all negative that there's just no positives here. There was expectations of a lot of cost savings that are supposed to come in, but I'm -- I feel like the tone is so negative on F '19 that we're not getting any balance on it. Is that intentional because these margin declines are so significant?","Anthony DiSilvestro","No, no. It's trying to be transparent in terms of what we see on the horizon. And given what we know now, we'd rather tell you now than tell you later. The issue is primarily one of cost inflation. And we're seeing and expecting an acceleration on the rate of inflation across a number of ingredient and packaging items. For example, we expect double-digit increases on steel and aluminum. A lot of that driven -- or all of it driven by the impact of anticipated tariffs. We're also expecting higher inflation on wheat and vegetables and resins and corrugated. So this is a meaningfully -- meaningful shift in the inflation outlook. Yes, we are going to continue to drive savings to help mitigate that, our 3% productivity program. Our cost-savings initiative continues to deliver. But they're just not sufficient to offset some of these headwinds. So we wanted to be transparent on that today and share with you kind of what we know at this point in time. We clearly have more work to do on this. We're in the midst of rolling up our operating plans and actions for next year. The strategic review we're going to take in the fourth quarter will also inform what actions we take in 2019. But again, we just wanted to share with you what we see on the horizon.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","I guess there's a 0lot of areas we can go. I'll come to soup real quick. You've resolved the issues with the key customer. Is there any reason to believe one way or the other that any other customers are pushing for concessions to sustain this support there?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. So back to the first point. We have made some progress on U.S. Soup. You can see we're down 1% in the quarter versus minus 8% in the first half. Again, we made some progress. We are, as we speak, undertaking our joint business plans with our key customers for next fiscal year and so that will help inform kind of the outlook for next year. I forgot the second part of your question, Jason.","Jason English","I'm really -- my core question is whether or not you have to make concessions to other retailers.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Look, it's a competitive environment. And if you look at the markets we operate in, whether it's Australia or Canada or increasingly so, in the U.S., there is clearly tension, and we need to continue to manage through that. And the way I think we do that is to do the things that make branded foods companies successful around their products and their marketing and their brand support and their availability. So we'll continue to do that and work through these joint business plans with our customers. So there's not really much more I can say on that one.","Jason English","Okay. And I want to come back real quick, my last question, I guess, to Ken Goldman's question on cash flow, use of cash, dividend, et cetera. I was surprised to see you financed Lance with so much short-dated debt. And I know you talked about your robust cash flow, but it doesn't look like it's -- and I think you would agree, it's not robust enough to service the debt maturity over the next 3 years. What levers do you have to pull to navigate through that? Or should we be expecting you to be rolling that debt and refinancing on the forward, likely into a higher-rate environment?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I think what we'll do is, as I said before, in terms of our priorities for the use of cash, once we fund our CapEx program, which obviously we're managing very carefully, pay the dividend, the balance will go to reduce debt. And so some of that obviously will get repaid and the balance that we clearly expect to refinance, and we'll have to see what the rate environment is at that time. But I think in the near term, I think we're well positioned in terms of our capital structure and the maturity schedule.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Anthony, can you give us a little more color as to what has gone off plan on Snyder's-Lance? You mentioned that they were trying to execute a price-realization strategy. What's been causing that to go awry? And secondly, can you talk a little bit about the reaction of, I guess, the Snyder's-Lance independent distribution network to this merger? What steps has been -- have been done to bring them into the fold within Campbell? What's been communicated to them to make sure that execution stays on track?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. So let me try to address some of those areas. I probably won't be able to address all of them. But in terms of where we are with Snyder's-Lance, I would say, first and foremost, we're very optimistic about what we've seen. We've owned the business now for kind of 8 weeks, and I would say that we're even more confident now in our ability to deliver the $295 million of cost and synergy savings. And as we look longer term, we're certainly on track to deliver the acquisition economics and the 2021 accretion goal. So I just want to make sure we talk about this in the right context. So -- but we have uncovered a couple of things, right? One is the higher-than-expected trade rate, and it reflects -- and I don't want to get into too much detail here, some decisions taken by the former management team. I think what's important, and in our Pepperidge Farm business, we have a very disciplined approach, process and system to managing trade spend, and we are going to implement that in Snyder's-Lance.","So that will help us immensely manage the situation. The second thing that's impacting us, and we're all seeing it is the impact of the higher transportation and logistics cost, which, quite frankly, did not moderate as we have expected. And the last situation, which we're working through, is some challenges related to relocating some Emerald nut production from California to Charlotte. The restart-up of that equipment has proven more challenging than the former management team thought and more challenging than we initially thought. So we're working through those 3 issues. We have action plans in place to do that. We believe they're short-term and addressable and remain very optimistic in the long-term outlook for the Snyder's opportunity. With respect to the DSD network, I mean all I can really say on that one is we now have 3 DSD systems, 2 for Pepperidge, 1 for bakery, 1 for snacks and now 1 for Snyder's-Lance, and we will continue to operate those 3 systems independently. That being said, there are significant opportunity to capture synergy in the distribution network, both at the warehouse level and at the depot level.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Baumgartner from Wells Fargo.","John Baumgartner","Anthony, I wanted to dig into the cash expectations for Lance. I mean, it seems the company had really been lacking in terms of automation and robotics in the plants. At the same time, the SKU complexity would seemingly suggest kind of a nice -- an opportunity for working capital improvement. So on balance, between working capital needs, incremental CapEx, synergies being back half-weighted in your guidance, how do you think about Lance's contribution to free cash over the next 1 to 2 years?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I think a couple of things there happened. And as we look at the business and some of you have looked at, obviously, at the consumer takeaway, it actually has been negatively impacted by the SKU rationalization efforts that the former management team started and that also we support. I think there's a long tail in the portfolio, and we're doing our best to clean that up a little bit. As our supply chain people have gone through those plans, we see significant opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the operations, potential network optimization opportunities given the overlap between our plant infrastructure and their plant infrastructure. And when we put together our deal model, we did anticipate some investments early on to correct those and to improve the long-term performance of the manufacturing network. So we will continue to execute those plans. We're very confident, as I said before, in the long-term ability for this business to generate positive cash flow. But it does require some investments both on the CapEx lines to take care of some quality situations that we see, to improve some efficiency and some costs related to getting at some of the synergy opportunity. Again, all those were factored in our acquisition economics, and we're confident certainly in our ability to fund those.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gosnell for any closing remarks.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Crystal. Keith is going to make a few closing comments.","Keith McLoughlin","Okay. Thanks, Ken. Actually, I just wanted to comment briefly on the question of the board and succession. Of course, the board is working on that. They're thinking about that. But candidly, right now, we're focused on the work we described, the strategy and the portfolio review and honestly, riding the ship. That's what we're focused on right now. ","As one question I noted, part of that work will be input to the board on the candidate qualifications and potential. So it's a little bit hard to know precisely what we need in that role until we complete the review, although you kind of note 90-10 what the candidate needs to look like. I would say we have talented candidates inside the company, and we will continue to focus on the mission that we have at hand and getting things back on track. ","Lastly, I'd just like to acknowledge, as many of you have pointed out, we're facing some tough market conditions and also some poor operating performance just straight ahead. We have some hard and urgent work in front of us, and we'll face that head on. However, we start from a foundation of strength that's been built over almost 150 years, with products and brands, market positions, margins and cash flow that would be the envy of many, many companies. So we'll do that. ","This company has a deep keel, being built over all that time and with that kind of cash and balance sheet strength, and we'll come out of this stronger. I'm confident in that. Lastly, I'd just say, of course, I'm going to be out, listening and talking to customers and suppliers and shareholders, and I very much look forward to meeting many, if not all, of you in the process. ","Thank you for your time and interest today, and have a nice weekend. And let me turn it back over to Ken to close the meeting.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Keith.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Call and webcast for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, CFO and Chief Administrative Officer; and Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance; as well as Stephanie Varnum, new Senior Manager in IR.","Denise will kick us off today with a strategic update and highlights of our results for the fourth quarter.

Morrison","Good morning. Thanks for joining Campbell's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. 1 year into our strategic transition, we have planted the seeds to return Campbell to sustainable, profitable net sales growth. As we stated at our recent Analyst Day, our transition is taking us longer than we anticipated. However, we are starting to see some green shoots that indicate the direction of Campbell is changing.","We declared 2012 as a year of investment. Over the last year, we've made significant investments in brand building, innovation and external development. We've also upgraded talent in key positions and changed our organization structure to build capabilities in innovation, marketing excellence, digital and external development. We are working diligently to evolve our culture and to leverage our high employee engagement for higher performance. This takes time, and we will not rest until we have hit our stride.","This morning, I'll offer my perspective about our progress as we execute our 3 growth strategies: first, stabilize and profitably grow North America Soup and Simple Meals; second, expand our international presence; and third, continue to drive growth in healthy beverages and baked snacks. Finally, we are folding Bolthouse Farms into Campbell. As we said, we will operate it as a separate business unit within the company.","A year ago, we expected that in fiscal 2013, we would return to growth levels consistent with our long-term targets on our core business. As we said at our analyst meeting in July, we expect the core business to return to growth this year but will not get all the way there due to a tougher environment than originally expected. The 2013 guidance we issued this morning reflects improvement of our core Campbell business and is inclusive of Bolthouse Farms.","All of us at Campbell's agree that the pace of our progress needs to accelerate. At the same time, we remain focused and energized by our new strategic direction. We are confident that the course we've charted positions Campbell for long-term success, and we are committed to creating shareholder value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth.","According to McKinsey's global economic intelligence, growth across the globe continued to falter in the last quarter. The only significant departure from this trend was in the United States, where in spite of lethargic growth overall, employment, consumer spending and housing markets took a positive turn. In contrast, Europe is almost in a recession, with much work remaining to address the fundamental imbalances fueling the 3-year long crisis. This environment is not for the faint of heart.","Looking at the food industry in the United States across all outlets, consumers made 4% fewer trips to buy groceries in the fourth quarter and purchased less per trip, contributing to a 1% decline in food dollar sales. Cost inflation has driven significant pricing to the consumer, which tends to put pressure on volumes.","Our take on these trends is that the consumer continues to be cautious, and that is not likely to change in the near future. However, we continue to believe that consumer-focused innovation, value offerings and strong marketing of powerful brands can and will drive growth, and that is precisely what we're focused on.","With that as context, let me now offer my perspective on Campbell's fourth quarter results. Our fourth quarter performance was overall in line with our expectations. Sales of $1.6 billion were steady with last year's quarter despite pressure from currency. Our adjusted EBIT declined due to the marketing investments we made and higher inflation.","We've had success with new product offerings in our beverage business. We've profitably grown our core U.S. Soup and Simple Meal business and significantly stepped up innovation in Simple Meals, and our Goldfish franchise has delivered exceptional growth again in this quarter.","In the fourth quarter, favorable contributions from below-the-line items enabled us to deliver full year adjusted EPS that was slightly better than our guidance. In our U.S. Soup and Simple Meals business, fourth quarter sales growth of 7% fueled a 3% increase in the segment's operating earnings. Most of the sales gain was driven by promotional timing with key retailers. Fourth quarter sales of condensed soup rose 14%, driven by strong levels of promotional activity and a 5% price increase.","We now have lapped the list price increase in ready-to-serve soups that we took in the fourth quarter of 2011, and stabilization in volumes contributed to the 1% RTS gain in the quarter, as did increased distribution in the club channel. Both our U.S. Broth and U.S. Sauce businesses had positive sales gains. For the full year, we met sales expectations on our important U.S. Soup and Simple Meals business.","We feel good about the progress we made this past year on new product development. In fact, new Simple Meals products developed using our enhanced consumer-driven innovation process began to ship in quarter 4. In fiscal 2013, we plan to introduce more than 50 new products in U.S. Soup and Simple Meals, up from 41 in fiscal 2012 and a dramatic increase from the 7 products we introduced in fiscal 2011. Among them are Campbell's Go! Soups, Campbell's Skillet Sauces, Campbell's Gourmet Bisques and new varieties of Chunky and Slow Kettle soups.","Retailer acceptance of our new products, targeted largely to the Millenials, has been extremely positive, and we look forward to the consumer response as they buy them and try them.","In Global Baking and Snacking, organic sales rose 2%, driven by Pepperidge Farm. Increased marketing investments drove double-digit growth in Goldfish crackers.","In our Australian business, we continue to see pressure from consumer spending and an overall challenging environment. I just returned from a trip from Australia, and despite the difficulties in that market in 2012, we continued to make investments in brand building and innovation, and we expect to show improved result in 2013.","In U.S. Beverages, we continued our top line growth with sales up 3%, outpacing the category. The strongest gains came from V8 Splash and V8 V-Fusion. New items contributed to our market share gains. We successfully launched V8 V-Fusion Smoothies, Energy, Sparkling and Kids drinks this year, and we're developing new advertising that we think will improve their performance going forward.","Now as we begin the new fiscal year, we're confident that we will improve our sales and earnings trends. Our confidence goes beyond the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and extends to the new products we're launching, the productivity gains we plan to make, the innovation pipeline that we will continue to build and a very focused set of initiatives aimed at optimizing all of the drivers of demand.","Today, we establish specific growth ranges for fiscal 2013 sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. This guidance reflects improved trends in the core business, as well as contributions from our acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, which we acquired at the start of our fiscal first quarter.","And now I'll turn it over to Craig for the financial review.","B. Craig Owens","Thank you, Denise. Good morning. I'll spend a few minutes reviewing our fourth quarter results and segment highlights, followed by a recap of our fiscal year results. And I'll conclude with our fiscal 2013 guidance.","For the quarter, we reported net sales of $1.6 billion comparable to a year ago. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, organic net sales increased by 3%. On August 6, we completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms for $1.55 billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. In the fourth quarter, we recorded pre-tax transaction cost of $5 million or $0.01 per share related to the acquisition. Excluding that impact, as well as the restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, adjusted EBIT decreased by 10% to $208 million, primarily due to the decline in the gross margin percentage and higher marketing expenses, partly offset by an increase in sales volume.","Adjusted earnings per share were $0.41 this quarter, a 5% decline as compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. The decline reflected lower EBIT, partially offset by the benefits for lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding.","In the fourth quarter, our reported net sales were comparable to the prior year. A 3-point gain in organic sales was offset by a 3-point decline from currency translation as the Australian dollar, the euro and the Canadian dollar have all weakened. As you can see on Slide #18, the growth in organic sales reflected volume, mix and pricing contributions of 6 points, partly offset by the negative impact of increased promotional spending of 3 points.","All of our reporting segments had positive volume and mix. We also enjoyed the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions, the majority of which came from 2 segments: Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Simple Meals. The promotional spending variance is primarily due to higher rates of spending in Global Baking and Snacking. As we've mentioned, we continue to invest to remain competitive and to protect our market positions at both Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm.","Our gross margin declined 130 basis points this quarter, from 39.8% to 38.5%. Cost inflation and increased promotional spending drove that decline, which was partly offset by productivity improvements and the margin benefit of higher selling prices. Overall, our inflation rate and cost of sales was about 5% in the quarter. As we expected, inflation was slightly lower in the second half than in the first.","Our marketing and selling expenses increased 5% to $206 million compared with $196 million in the prior year. The rise reflected a 6% increase in advertising and consumer promotion expenses, higher spending to support innovation efforts and higher selling expense, partly offset by a decline due to currency.","The increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense was driven by our U.S. Simple Meals segment, with increases in both U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. Administrative expense was $170 million for the quarter, which was comparable to a year ago.","Below the operating earnings line, net interest expense fell $1 million or 4%. The adjusted tax rate declined 2.4 points to 30.1% from 32.5% in the prior year due to lower taxes on foreign earnings in the current year. Adjusted net earnings declined 8% this quarter, and adjusted earnings per share declined by 5%. Adjusted EPS benefited from a 2% decrease in diluted shares outstanding.","Fourth quarter segment sales results and corresponding organic growth rates are shown on Slide 21. Global Baking and Snacking organic sales increased 2%, driven by Pepperidge Farm growth. Pepperidge Farm sales increased primarily from double-digit growth in Goldfish snack crackers, partially offset by sales reduction in cookies and frozen products.","Sales in Arnott's were comparable to prior year as strong growth in Indonesia was offset by declines in Australia. U.S. Simple Meals sales increased 7%, led by a strong performance in U.S. Soup and growth in U.S. Sauces. The driver of a 9% gain in U.S. Soup sales was condensed soup, which benefited from movements in retailer inventory associated with the timing of promotional activity, as well as modest consumption increases.","U.S. Sauce sales increased 4%. Sales of both Prego pasta sauce and Pace Mexican sauces achieved higher volumes, benefiting from an effective marketing campaign.","Within the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment, organic sales increased by 1%. Higher sales in Latin America, primarily from beverage products, were partly offset by declines in Canada, while sales in Europe and the Asia Pacific region were both comparable to the year-ago period. In Europe, volume-driven gains in France were offset by lower sales in Germany. In the Asia Pacific region, sales growth in Japan and Malaysia was offset by declines in our Australian Soup business.","U.S. Beverage sales, which continued to outpace the category, increased 3% versus prior year. The increase was primarily driven by double-digit growth in V8 Splash beverages and gains in V8 V-Fusion beverages, partly offset by declines in V8 vegetable juice. Sales of V8 V-Fusion in the quarter benefited from the launch of new products, including smoothies, energy, sparkling and kids drinks. Sales of North American Foodservice decreased 2% due to declines in canned soup sales.","Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals rose by 3% to $104 million for the quarter. This increase reflected earnings gains in U.S. Soup, partly offset by a decline in U.S. Sauces. Within the segment, higher sales volume was partly offset by a decline in gross margin percentage and increased advertising expense.","Earnings within Global Baking and Snacking declined 10%, reflecting lower earnings in Arnott's, partly offset by growth in Pepperidge Farm. For the segment, the decrease in earnings was primarily due to increased promotional spending and cost inflation, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements.","Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages decreased by 17% despite higher sales volume, primarily due to an increase in marketing expense and a decline in gross margin percentage related to cost inflation.","Within International Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings declined 38%, reflecting lower earnings in Canada and increased marketing investment in Latin America. For the international segment, the decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to cost inflation and increased promotional spending, partly offset by higher selling prices.","Operating earnings within North American Foodservice decreased by $6 million or 38% versus prior year. The decrease was primarily due to increased promotional spending and cost inflation.","U.S. Soup sales for the quarter rose 9%. Sales of condensed soup increased 14%, with double-digit growth in eating varieties and gains in cooking varieties. Condensed soups sales benefited from movements in retailer inventory levels. Estimated inventories were lower when we began the quarter compared with the year-ago level and ended higher than the prior year's quarter, largely in support of in-store promotional activities. Condensed soups sales also benefited from consumption increases.","Ready-to-serve sales increased by 1%. Sales of Campbell Chunky soups rose slightly, while sales of Campbell's Select Harvest soups declined. Campbell's Slow Kettle Soups, which we launched in July 2011, added to the sales growth. Broth sales grew 4%, primarily due to volume-driven gains in aseptically-packaged broths and the benefit of the July 2011 launch of Swanson Flavor Boost concentrated broth, partly offset by declines in canned broth.","The U.S. wet soup market share results from the latest 52 weeks, based on IRI multi-outlet data, is shown on Slide 25. Note that in prior quarters, our market share figures covered the food, drug and mass retailer channels and were based on IRI data as well as internal company estimates. This new data, which we plan to use going forward, has been expanded by IRI and now includes food, drug, mass, military and most dollar and club stores. We estimate that this more comprehensive consumption data covers approximately 80% of our U.S. retail sales, and the report no longer includes any adjustment based on internal estimates. Overall, Campbell performance in the new IRI retail universe is similar to that with the previous data set","Based on the new data, Campbell's market share declined on a 52-week basis by 2.4 points to 58.9%. The change was primarily driven by ready-to-serve soup. In ready-to-serve soup, other branded players had market share gains. Our U.S. Soup dollar sales declined 2.9%, while the overall category rose 1.1% over the past 52 weeks. We underperformed the category as a result of our reduction and promotions and our list price increase, among other factors. Other branded players increased sales by 10% in the period, while private label sales rose 2.1%.","Next, I'll move to an overview of full year results. For the year, both reported or organic net sales were comparable to the prior year, excluding items impacting comparability in both years, adjusted EBIT of $1.2 billion declined 9% versus a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to decline in gross margin percentage. Both sales and EBIT results were consistent with our annual guidance. Adjusted EBIT -- I'm sorry, adjusted EPS declined 4%. We continued to benefit from using our strong cash flows to repurchase shares.","Organic net sales in fiscal 2012 were comparable to the prior year. As you can see on Chart 27, higher selling prices were offset by price -- by pressure from volume mix and the negative sales impact of our increased promotional spending.","Our fiscal 2012 gross margin declined by 140 basis points to 38.8% from 40.2%. This decline was due to cost inflation, increased promotional spending and unfavorable mix, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements. The inflation rate and cost of goods sold was approximately 6%, which was above our long-term average, yet at the low end of our expectations for the year.","Marketing and selling expenses increased $13 million to $1.02 billion, primarily due to a 3% increase in advertising and consumer promotion expenses. As we mentioned at Analyst Day, we're now breaking out our full year advertising and consumer promotion expense. For the fiscal year, advertising and consumer promotion expense increased by $14 million to $506 million. Administrative expense for the year decreased $1 million to $611 million versus $612 million last year.","Below the operating line, net interest expense fell 5% or $5 million to $106 million. This decline was primarily driven by lower rates on our long-term debt portfolio. The adjusted tax rate for the fiscal year decreased 50 basis points to 31%. For the fiscal year, adjusted net earnings declined 7%, and after benefiting from a 3% reduction in diluted shares outstanding, adjusted EPS declined 4% to $2.44.","For the fiscal year, U.S. Simple Meals sales declined 1%, reflecting a 2% decrease in U.S. Soup, partly offset by sales growth in U.S. Sauces. Sales of U.S. Sauces increased slightly as gains in Prego pasta sauce were mostly offset by lower sales of Pace Mexican sauce and declines in other Simple Meal products.","Organic sales of the Global Baking and Snacking segment increased 1% versus prior year, as growth in Pepperidge Farm was partly offset by declines in Arnott's. Pepperidge Farm sales increased primarily due to double-digit growth in Goldfish snack crackers, partly offset by declines in cookie and frozen products. Arnott's performance was impacted by a difficult trading environment in Australia. As a result, Arnott's sales declined for the year, reflecting an increase in promotional spending that was not successful in increasing total sales.","Within the International Simple Meals and Beverage segment, organic sales declined 2%, primarily due to lower sales in Canada, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, partly offset by gains in Latin America. U.S. Beverage sales increased 2% of sales of both V8 Splash beverages and V8 V-Fusion beverages rose, while sales of V-8 vegetable juice declined.  Within the segment, volume gains were partially offset by the impact of higher promotional spending.","Sales of the North American Foodservice segment increased 3%, primarily driven by volume-driven gains in fresh chilled soup sold at retail.","Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased $1 million to $658 million versus the prior year, reflecting earnings gains in U.S. Soup that were mostly offset by lower earnings in U.S. Sauce. For the segment, higher selling prices, productivity improvement and lower promotional spending were largely offset by volume declines and cost inflation.","Earnings within Global Baking and Snacking declined by 11%, primarily due to cost inflation, increased promotional spending and higher advertising, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements. International Simple Meals and Beverages earnings declined by 17%, primarily due to lower earnings in the Asia-Pacific region and Canada, as well as increased costs associated with the company's marketing expansion in China.","Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages declined by 26%, primarily due to inflation and the cost of juice concentrates and packaging materials, increased promotional spending and higher advertising expense. Operating earnings in North American Foodservice increased by 4%, primarily driven by higher selling prices and productivity improvements, partially offset by cost inflation.","U.S. Soup sales for the fiscal year declined by 2%. As you can see on Chart 32, a 7-point decline in ready-to-serve soup was only partially offset by a 1-point increase in condensed soup and a 3-point increase in broth sales. The 1-point increase in condensed soup was driven by gains in eating varieties, while cooking varieties were even with the prior year. The 7-point decline in RTS reflected lower volumes, the result of higher promoted and non-promoted price points at retail, offset by the positive impact of the Slow Kettle launch. The increase in broth sales was primarily driven by volume gains and new item launches.","Cash flow from operations was strong at $1.12 billion. This $20 million decline compared with last year reflected the impact of lower cash earnings, partly offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures of $323 million were in line with our full year expectations and were up from the $272 million of a year ago.","Looking ahead, we are forecasting capital spending in fiscal 2013 of approximately $330 million, including Bolthouse. During the fiscal year, we utilized our positive cash flow to repurchase 12.6 million shares at a cost of $412 million under our strategic share repurchase program announced in June 2011 and our practice of buying back shares to offset those issued under our equity-based compensation programs. Net debt was $2,455,000,000, a decrease of $145 million.","For fiscal 2013, Campbell expects to grow total company sales between 10% and 12%, with adjusted EBIT growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 3% to 5%. Within these ranges, currency is expected to be neutral to slightly negative. We expect interest expense to increase approximately $30 million, primarily due to the acquisition financing, and we expect the tax rate to be between 31% and 32%.","We expect our gross margin percentage to decline approximately 1 to 2 points, primarily due to the addition of Bolthouse, which operates with a lower margin structure. Gross margin on our base business is expected to be comparable to 2012, as we anticipate that our pricing actions and productivity savings will mostly offset the impact of 4% cost inflation.","We also expect our operating margin to decline slightly in 2013, primarily due to the impact of Bolthouse. As we mentioned in July, our expectation for fiscal 2013 includes a modest reduction in advertising and consumer spending for the year, notably in U.S. Soup. Thus, we expect our marketing expense will decline slightly on our base business for next year. However, these savings will be offset by some upward pressure on SG&A from a 30% increase in pension expense, among other factors.","The acquisition of Bolthouse Farms was completed in the first quarter, as I said, for $1.55 billion, plus the impact of purchase price adjustments. We financed that purchase with debt. Our fiscal 2013 guidance includes the estimated impact of the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, while excluding the impact of onetime transaction costs.","We expect Bolthouse to contribute approximately $750 million to sales, which is about 10 points of sales growth for total Campbell. Bolthouse will drive most of our growth in adjusted EBIT, and it will add $0.05 to $0.07 to our adjusted EPS, including the estimated impact of purchase accounting and the suspension of our strategic share repurchase plan.","Thank you. With that, I'll now turn it back to Jennifer.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Craig. At this time, we will conduct the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Driscoll from Citi Investments.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wanted to ask a little bit about the organic revenue growth within your F '13 guidance. So I believe that Bolthouse -- Craig, I think you said that it will add 10 points of revenue growth such that organic revenue would be just 0% to 2% within your guidance range. Given that Campbell's is accelerating the new product introductions with -- I think you actually went from 47 to 50 on the slides, so you're now showing 50 new products planned for F '13, and that Campbell's will realize price increases in F '13, partially because of the inflationary pressures. Why is organic revenue growth so low? Why isn't it going to be something a lot better than 0% to 2%?","B. Craig Owens","Well, David, I think we continue to see some headwinds from the consumer environment. As we've also said, we're going to lower our advertising spend in the U.S. Soup business. While we think that has good payback to it, it will have a negative impact on our sales number in U.S. Soup for the year. And it's -- I would point out that we are anticipating an improvement versus our prior year organic sales with all of that in.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just one follow-up on that then. Can you quantify the fourth quarter buy-in on condensed soup? I believe there's a 5% price increase in the fourth quarter for condensed and that the retailers bought in ahead of that, hence, the significant growth in condensed. Will that -- I assume that, that negatively hits volumes in 1Q '13, but can you give us some quantification of what the magnitude you expect to happen in the first quarter?","B. Craig Owens","It is very difficult to precisely quantify. I think, though, one thing that's important, it's not so much the impact of the buy-in prior to price increase as it is that we had pretty significant consumer promotion activity going on at the end of the quarter, which caused some increase in inventories in-store. We expect to see that sell-through. But you're right, there could be a little bit of overhang into Q1.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, I mean, the -- what we saw was a normal situation around our price increase, and actually coming into our F '13, a reasonable inventory level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Denise, excluding Bolthouse, you've grown or you intend to grow EPS this year by 1% to 2%, which is obviously quite a bit away from the 5% to 7% long-term target. How quickly do you think can you get to that long-term target? And what needs to happen for you to get there?","Denise M. Morrison","We recognize that the EPS will represent an improvement in trend on the base business but won't get us all the way there. We're not really disclosing a time frame that we will get there, but we're just giving guidance for the entire business inclusive of Bolthouse Farms.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Then maybe asked differently, at the Analyst Day and today, again, you've reiterated that the growth rate that you're looking at for 2013 isn't quite what you expected last year. How much worse is the growth rate for this year than what you expected when you put out your strategic plan last year?","Jennifer Driscoll","I think, Thilo, we talked about a return to our long-term targets, which is 3% to 4% sales, 4% to 5% EBIT and 5% to 7% EPS.","Denise M. Morrison","Right. And I think that the delivery this year was in line with the guidance that we gave in July 2011.","Operator","Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick point of clarification. What sort of cash contribution do you expect to make towards your pensions this year?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. We expect that to total about $85 million on a consolidated basis.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And any expectations around the possibility of refinancing your December maturity? Or should we continue to see that paid down?","B. Craig Owens","I think you can assume we'll pay that down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You had mentioned, I think, some positive consumption or take-away in condensed, even when you exclude the inventory adjustments that you discussed. So while it's a small quarter overall, I'm just trying to get a sense if you can glean anything in the data that you have. I guess that makes you either incrementally more or less comfortable that the pricing you're taking in condensed can be done with kind of manageable impacts on volume.","Denise M. Morrison","We -- Andrew, first of all, we have seen some positive consumption across Soup, particularly on condensed soup, and that's encouraging. We do feel that the price increase that we took will result in a reasonable increase in the retail price on the shelf to the consumer. However, we are planning for some volume impact due to that price increase. So that we're expecting that there'll be some pros and cons as we go into next year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then with condensed in the quarter up as much as it was, I guess I would've thought the mix impact would have benefited gross margins in the U.S. Simple Meals segment more than it did. Was there something else offsetting that, in that segment, that you can clarify?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. You're probably seeing a little bit of the promotional spending associated with the retailer activity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sticking on the topic of promotions in Soup, I imagine a lot of your merchandising plans for the early part of the soup season are locked and loaded now. With that said, any expectation of recovering some of the loss merchandising support you ceded to your competitor last year?","Denise M. Morrison","Well, as you know, a couple of years ago, we had engaged in some pretty deep discounting in the category that we walked away from last year in an effort to spend more and invest more in brand building. We believe going into this season, we will have spending against an optimized driver of demand, which is inclusive of promotions and advertising and consumer promotions. So we think that we're working this season in a much more balanced way.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So Denise, should I interpret that to mean sort of comparable levels to last year? That last year is sort of the new base to look at?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, yes, that's correct.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And real quick on innovation. Can you update us -- you said successful acceptance by retailer. In terms of net distribution, have you been able to secure some of the net distribution gain in Soup? Or has it been primarily a swap for other items?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. It's still early days, Jason, but we are on track with our new products broadly. And our -- the retailers have accepted the products and it's been very positive. So we expect that, that momentum will continue, and the proof is what will the consumer do. So we'll be given an early read on that next quarter.","B. Craig Owens","So it will be a distribution gain, but it's too early to quantify.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess my question maybe to Craig on the outlook in terms of the EBIT growth versus the EPS growth. How much of a -- I think you said there's some headwind from interest expense on Bolthouse. And then you've also got -- which way, on an operating basis, is the tax rate swinging? And then, is there any kind of net benefit of the shares year-to-year? I'm just trying to kind of judge the difference between the 4 to 6 versus the 3 to 5 because it would seem that, that might be more of a gap.","B. Craig Owens","Right. The -- so the tax rate might be slightly negative. The bigger impact is interest and also the cessation of our share repurchase program.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But Craig, are you following me to the extent that, okay, tax rate is slightly negative. Interest expense is a clear negative. You're not going to have the benefit of the shares, so why wouldn't the difference between EBIT and EPS growth be, let's say, more negative?","B. Craig Owens","So there is a carryover benefit on shares, so we stopped the share repurchase program. But because we bought throughout the year in F '12, there's a carryover benefit in the share count, and that's a -- that's a slight positive, and that's partially offsetting the interest expense.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then, I'm sorry, if I could just follow up real quickly on Arnott's. I think you said that Australia continued to be challenged, but that was offset by, I guess, some export business to -- whether it was Indonesia or Malaysia or someplace. But why shouldn't we still be pretty worried about Australia and Arnott's, given how profitable that business is?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Just one clarification. We have businesses in both Malaysia and Indonesia. We have production facilities in both those places so -- and both those businesses did well.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay.","Denise M. Morrison","I think -- I just came back from Australia and had extensive meetings with the team and the customers there. And I think the consumer environment is still challenged. The consumers' savings rate is probably one of the highest it's ever been, and there is some concern over that. However, the team has recognized that this is an environment that we have to play in probably for a while. And so the joint business plans that we've been able to work with in the marketplace are very encouraging. And so we -- during F '12, we actually continued to invest in brand building and the innovation pipeline, so we believe that we have strong plans going into 2013 that, hopefully, adjust to the situation.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is that one of the reasons -- is Arnott's in Australia one of the reasons why you're being a little bit more cautious on the guidance, including sales, which I think was one of Dave Driscoll's questions?","Denise M. Morrison","I think that's part of it. I think the other is we've been pretty conservative on our estimates for our new product innovation. The consumer will let us know if we can be more exuberant.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask you a question in relation to marketing and the 3% increase that we saw for the year. I just wanted to confirm -- we've talked about this in previous quarters. But that, obviously, was up pretty nicely for Soup but just down -- and was it down in all other divisions from there? I'm just trying to understand kind of the magnitude of the shift that occurred across the divisions.","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So Chris, the primary increases would have been against our sauce business, against our adult cracker business within Pepperidge Farm and against our beverage business in North America. Those would have been the sources of most significant increases. There would've been increases in some of our emerging marketing businesses, too. But those are pretty small relative to the total.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just to understand, then, for fiscal '13, that increase then -- I'm sorry, that I think you said a slight decline from marketing. Is that -- was that just the U.S. Soup or was that for the overall company?","B. Craig Owens","The decline -- well, it will be  a decline for the overall company that is driven by a decline in U.S. Soup primarily.","Denise M. Morrison","For the overall company, though, our total marketing, which will be advertising, consumer and trade promotion, will be about average with the industry.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. If I could just ask a follow-up then. In relation to -- just to be clear on the new product shipments, where there -- there were some in the fourth quarter. I'm just curious if that was an incremental benefit year-over-year to the revenue growth in Q4?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Yes, but not very materially.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. A small amount shipped for some shelf stuff with retailers that did their planogramming in the fourth quarter.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So most of that will come really then Q1, which we're in now.","Denise M. Morrison","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Aaron from RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a question on condensed. There's -- there have been some issues, I think, with excess capacity on the private label side in that business. And I'm just wondering, when you think about that in the context of price increases that you're taking for this year, are you at all concerned that the price gaps in that part of the business are going to widen in fiscal '13?","Denise M. Morrison","I think that we will always watch price gaps versus private label and competition. Private label in the Soup business has traditionally been about 10 points below the average, so we're not expecting that this would be a huge factor.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just one quick clarification. I think you said in your prepared remarks that Bolthouse is going to drive most of the EBIT growth in fiscal '13. But I think, just doing kind of some math on it, it looks like Bolthouse should drive more than all of the EBIT growth. So I'm just trying to make sure that I'm understanding that correctly.","B. Craig Owens","If you look at the base business implied in the guidance, it's about flat at EBIT, slightly up but pretty close to flat.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe I'll follow up on that, but I'll take it off line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Craig, just wanted to get a little bit more color on your outlook for cost of goods inflation for this year. And I think, going back to what you said in July, it looks like the range is the same, but I just want to make sure. Has anything really changed in terms of the cost inflation outlook you're using today versus what you said in July?","B. Craig Owens","So the F '13 outlook for input materials, packaging and energy is around 3%, and the total inflation assumption for cost of sales is around 4% for F '13.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the difference between the 3% and the 4% is you've got some higher like pension expense and health care costs. Is that it?","B. Craig Owens","Precisely.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then are you still -- if I remembered it correctly, you were expecting, net of productivity, the inflation would be closer to 0% to 2%. Is that still the case?","B. Craig Owens","Yes.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the way it phases, anything that we should think about in terms of first half versus second half?","B. Craig Owens","No, I don't think so. I mean, we'll keep updating you through the year, but there's no significant difference, I don't think, as we look across the year.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just finally, how much of it is locked in for the year versus might be subject to volatility?","B. Craig Owens","We tend to average being out about 6 months. We may be a little bit longer than that right now, given the way that the commodity markets have moved, but you should think of us, generally, as being about 6 months out.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just sneak one in on -- in the same theme. Just all of the pricing -- you've priced fully to all of your inflation expectation, like there's not incremental pricing action you'd need at this point.","B. Craig Owens","Well, I -- we're not going to announce future pricing activity at this point. But yes, what we said at Analyst Day, and what is still true, is that between the pricing we have already announced in the Soup business and the productivity savings that we're expecting, we're pretty well covering off the cost inflation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up a little bit with Craig. You said it was difficult to quantify the retailer inventory on what you mentioned, some impact on the Soup, Sauces and Beverages volume. How much visibility do you have into that inventory? And like, I mean, is it -- do you expect those levels to grow significantly with a lot of this new product activity in the coming quarter?","B. Craig Owens","The thing that's difficult about it, Jonathan, is that there's a tremendous seasonality to our inventory movements anyway. So the fourth quarter always sees an inventory decline in total versus the third quarter. And what we saw this year was that both the starting point a little bit lower than the previous year, ending point a little bit higher, but all in the context of decreasing inventories. In the first quarter, we almost always see an inventory increase. And so trying to quantify what the net impact of that will be is just difficult on big inventory numbers. If we look at the warehouse inventory levels that we have visibility to, they were very normal for the fourth quarter. The in-store inventory was somewhat higher than normal at the end of the fourth quarter because of the promotional activity that we've talked about, and that's what created a pretty big swing in a pretty small quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So operating earnings, if I'm looking at Page 31, I think it is, on the slide deck, it looks as though outside of U.S. Simple Meals and Foodservice, you've obviously had a big decline in operating earnings across some of these segments here in fiscal '12. And I think a lot of that was due to competitive dynamics and cost pressures and so on. For those segments where we have seen a major decline, are we through the worst here? Where are the bright spots in terms of what could get a lot better in fiscal '13? And where are things still very tough from a profit growth perspective?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. For example, in the beverage business, next year, we'll have a combination of both price and productivity improvements that will lead to an improved EBIT situation there. We also are expecting some lower commodity costs and some stronger enablers that will kick in about the middle of the year. But we have plans on most of the businesses to work the EBIT line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Moskow from Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","2 questions. One is, I don't know if you answered why retailers were promoting condensed during the summer. I mean, it was the hottest summer in history. And then secondly, getting back to Ed Aaron's question, the math I had on Bolthouse was that operating profit was running at about $92 million on an adjusted basis. I have assumed maybe $100 million of a contribution for fiscal '13. And if I do it that way, I get core EBIT down like 2% to 4%. And I just wondered if that has anything to do with the mix shift away from Soup in fiscal '13 as you lower advertising and you probably have a sales decline.","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So, well, first, with respect to promotional activity, I think it's back-to-school promotional activity that we're seeing, which is, in some cases, getting earlier in the year than it has been. But I think that's the answer to that one. With respect to Bolthouse, you have to recognize that versus the historical numbers that you've seen for Bolthouse, there is asset write-up as part of purchase accounting that will lead to higher depreciation that they've had historically. There's both an accounting change and some retention bonus kind of activity that we have in the compensation expense related to Bolthouse. And then there are certain items that are related to Bolthouse that actually fall into the Campbell P&L as part of the integration of Bolthouse. So I think all of those things are leading you to over-impute operating earnings to Bolthouse. The reality is that the base business EBIT organic growth is around flat.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And as far as like maybe Soup being down a little bit, does that have more of an adverse effect on profit being down? Or is it about the same? If sales of Soup were down one, maybe profit for the overall business would be down one?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Well, Soup contribution, particularly in condensed, is higher. It's -- I think it's pretty well understood, it's higher than the company total. But I -- you're looking at some fairly small movements here. I don't think -- if you come back and think about it margin, right, we've said gross margins would be pretty comparable on the base business to prior year, and, really, the same thing is true at operating profit, too.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Last question. Craig, higher grain costs, are those going to influence your Pepperidge Farm and Arnott business at all? Or is it all in the guidance?","B. Craig Owens","Well, it's in the guidance. I mean, they do influence it, of course. There is pressure more at Pepperidge than at Arnott's, given the 2 fairly distinct grain markets that we're talking about. But it is anticipated in the guidance that we would have pressure at Pepperidge.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Soup. I just wanted to get a better sense of how you're currently thinking about the scale of the various new ready-to-serve products being shipped in fiscal '13. For items like Go! Soups and Gourmet Bisques, are your goals to reach, I guess, a similar level of ACV to what we saw for Slow Kettle in 2012? And one quick follow-up. With respect to slotting fees, can you give us a sense of whether you incurred anything material in the fourth quarter and whether we should expect a more significant impact here to be concentrated in Q1 or Q2?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. We had planned for Slow Kettle to reach a lower ACV distribution than it actually did achieve. And we're planning for our new Go! Soups, Bisques and Skillet Sauces to reach an average amount of ACV distribution that we have seen in the past. And so far, that seems to be the case.","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So slotting fees for this year's fourth quarter were up about $6 million versus prior year same quarter. And you should not expect a significant difference in Q1 related to slotting fees.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer from UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","2 quick follow-ups on other questions. On the marketing spend, going to be a little bit lower year-over-year for fiscal '13. One might have assumed that new product news would necessitate and even respond to higher levels of advertising. Is Campbell thinking about shifting some ad weight away from imagery ads, such as the \"Amazing what soup can do\" ads, that are more general and product -- and category broad in terms of its support levels and towards more awareness new product launch type ads? Is that some of the thinking?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. Well, our marketing expense will be down modestly versus this year. And our A&C expense will be down due to reduced spending on our U.S. Soup, but we will be more than competitive in our share of voice on that business. For our new products, the marketing support will vary, but it will have a mix of TV, print, digital and promotional vehicles, each at competitive levels. And that's how we have planned the year. If they tend to take off in a bigger way, we will subsequently increase the investment.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Overall spending on new product support will be up, David, so the decrease is related to the base.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just also a follow-up on the timing of the shelving of your various new products. Are you fully distributed now for what you think you're going to have out there, not just the new packaging like the Go! Soups but also the repackaging of your Light soups? I mean, are you where you think you'll be in a few months' time? Are you pretty much re-shelved at this point?","Denise M. Morrison","Most of the items have really just started shipping. We've shipped some in the fourth quarter and some in -- have been shipping in August. So it usually takes about 3 to 4 weeks to get through the system to be totally on shelf before we actually start the marketing around them.","Jennifer Driscoll","And with respect to Select Harvest and 100% Natural, that's going to take place over a period of time, [indiscernible] October and November.","Denise M. Morrison","Right. That will be a flow-through, exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Lash from Morningstar.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was just curious. Obviously, cash flow continues to be very solid and, while you still are well focused, appears to be paying down the debt related to the Bolthouse acquisition. I just wanted to get a sense for your appetite for additional acquisitions going forward, either in your core category or expanding your platforms further in international markets.","B. Craig Owens","So I think we said both at Analyst Day and also when we did the call on Bolthouse that while we're suspending our share repurchase, we're not suspending our activities to continue to look for good, value-accretive acquisition targets or partnership opportunities or JV opportunities where they make sense. We do feel like we've still got some capacity within our balance sheet, and so we continue to try to advance our strategies by looking for those kinds of opportunities. Now having said that, they're few and far between out there, and we're very rigorous in the way that we evaluate them. But we have not -- we haven't stopped looking.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can I ask one follow-up? With regards to your comment that they're few and far between, is that because the premiums that sellers are looking for are too high? Or is that just the potential for -- or the potential quality companies that are out there is small in and of itself?","B. Craig Owens","Well, I think it's both things interacting with each other, right? There, just numerically, there are not a lot of good quality properties. And consequently, when one does come to market, it tend -- there tends to be pretty strong competition for it.","Denise M. Morrison","And we're very disciplined about the way we're going at this.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale from KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Denise, you mentioned new products. You're being -- I interpret what you said as being conservative in terms of what you're modeling for new product contribution to sales growth. Can you give us a sense of what you are expecting, and so we can judge whether it's conservative or not?","Denise M. Morrison","It's early days, and again, we just started shipping. So as the year unfolds, we'll have an early read in quarter 1. And then in quarter 2, we should have a much better read on the consumer acceptance of these products and the consumption resulting from that. So I'd rather wait until that point in time than speculate.","Jennifer Driscoll","Okay. With that, we will conclude our Q&A session, and we'll move over to Denise for the wrap-up.","Denise M. Morrison","Thank you for your questions. And we'd like to leave you with 4 key takeaways from today's call: first, we reported positive organic sales growth this quarter and finished the year with sales and EBIT consistent with the guidance we gave in July 2011 and EPS slightly ahead of that guidance; second, we told you that for fiscal 2013, we expect 10% to 12% sales growth, 4% to 6% growth from adjusted EBIT and 3% to 5% growth in EPS, including the impact of Bolthouse Farms; third, we plan to continue investing in new product innovation and brand building to optimize all of the drivers of demand; and fourth, we remain excited about the addition of Bolthouse Farms, which offers a growth platform in the faster-growing packaged fresh category and increased scale in healthy beverages.","We've made progress for those strategies in fiscal 2012, and while clearly we have more work to do, we believe that the strategies we outlined to you a little over a year ago are starting to gain traction. We look forward to giving you an update on our execution of the strategies next quarter, including the early read on this year's new product launches.","Thank you very much for your support of Campbell's in fiscal 2012, and we look forward to seeing many of you at the Barclays Back-to-School Conference in Boston on Wednesday and Thursday.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks for joining us for Campbell's Fourth Quarter Earnings webcast.

Please go ahead.","Kenneth Gosnell","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2016. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake MacMinn, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentations. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. The call is open to the media who'll participate in a listen-only mode.","Today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide two or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements.","As we said in this morning's news release, in fiscal 2016, the company incurred mark-to-market losses associated with interim remeasurement of certain U.S. pension plans. The impact on EPS was $0.26 per share. The company also incurred restructuring charges, implementation cost and other related costs associated with the new organizational structure and cost savings initiatives. The impact on EPS was $0.07 per share. Our comparisons of fiscal 2016 with fiscal 2015 will exclude these items for comparability. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. With that, let me turn the call over to Denise.","Denise Morrison","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today I'll share my perspective on the overall operating environment, the changes we've implemented at Campbell, and our first quarter business performance. The seismic shifts that we've outlined in previous meetings continue to impact the food industry, which remains under pressure from new, global economic realities, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health and well-being, and the continued growth of digital marketing and e-commerce channels.","Looking at the operating environment, conditions remain challenging. In the United States, the economic situation is mixed. Unemployment continues to improve, but consumers remain very cautious. We're continuing to see Americans save more and spend less amid the uncertain economic climate. Outside the U.S., we're seeing macro-economic challenges in other markets where we have significant operations, including Canada, China and Indonesia.","Generating growth in this environment has been and remains difficult. As a result, the industry continues to respond with consolidation, spin-offs, aggressive cost cutting programs, and other measures to improve operational efficiency. Meanwhile, food retailers continue to respond by reconfiguring existing stores with a focus on the perimeter by launching new, smaller formats and by investing heavily in e-commerce capabilities.","Several years ago, we recognized the early signs of many of the trends that the industry is currently facing and we started taking steps designed to best enable Campbell to navigate the changing landscape. While we've made progress through fiscal 2015, our actions haven't been sufficient. That's why last year we put a bolder plan in place to reshape Campbell. We began fiscal 2016 after successfully implementing significant changes to align our enterprise structure with our strategy. We formed three new divisions with clearer portfolio roles. We began implementing a three-year, $250 million cost savings initiative that is delivering earlier than expected benefits.","We created a new integrated global services organization to provide services to our divisions more efficiently and effectively. We initiated the first phase of zero-based budgeting to instill greater cost discipline and create an ownership mindset among employees. We added another growth engine in Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh division and extend our presence and scale beyond produce into the deli section of the store perimeter. As a result of these actions, we entered fiscal 2016 better positioned to execute against our strategic imperative. With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results.","I'm pleased with our overall performance to start the year. Organic sales in the quarter were comparable to a year ago and consistent with our expectations, given that we're cycling an increase of 5%. I'm particularly pleased with our third consecutive quarter of adjusted gross margin expansion and the improvements we've made in our supply chain. Importantly, we delivered strong, adjusted EBIT and EPS performance.","As you saw this morning, we revised our annual guidance. Given our improved margin outlook for the year, we raised guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, while we lowered sales guidance to reflect increased currency headwinds. Our new reportable segments align with our three new divisions. Anthony will discuss our revised guidance and provide a detailed review of our segment results in a moment, but I wanted to offer my perspective on several notable items within each of our three new divisions","Let's start with our largest division, America's Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. As we've discussed with you before, we're focused on increasing price realization, optimizing promotional spending, and improving our supply chain performance. While we have more work to do in its early days, I'm encouraged by the progress the Americas team made on all three fronts.","As a result of our pricing and lower promotion activity, soup volumes declined as expected, consumption was soft in the quarter, but this is not surprising due to the fact that our promotional activity and new advertising campaigns started later in the quarter versus prior year. In early October, we began airing our new Made for Real, Real Life advertising. Built around the strategic insights we've shared with you about the changing mosaic of the American family, this campaign represents a major departure for Campbell and depicts how our real food fits into real people's lives in an authentic and relatable way. Digital media is playing a larger role in this campaign than in previous efforts. Looking ahead, we expect improved sales performance in the second quarter as our marketing spending increases and the campaign gains momentum.","As we talked about in July, we're focused on fewer, bigger innovations in the Americas division. While our new Swanson bottled broth is off to a slower start than anticipated, both Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soup in K-Cups and Campbell's Organic Soups are meeting expectations. The highlight in this division was the significant gross margin expansion. A major improvement this quarter was our supply chain performance, as evidenced by better customer service levels. We're cycling significant supply chain challenges, especially in transportation and warehousing. We're also benefiting from the mild inflationary environment this quarter. That said, the supply chain team has driven results ahead of expectations. Overall, the new Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division is off to a promising start in delivering against its portfolio role.","Our Global Biscuits and Snacks division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio role is to expand in developed and developing markets while improving margins. This division, too, is off to a promising start in fulfilling its portfolio role with organic sales growth, improved gross margins and strong earnings. I'm especially encouraged by our sales performance in our core markets, the U.S. and Australia. In U.S. biscuits and bakery, our Pepperidge Farm brands performed very well, driven by strong growth in crackers and fresh bakery, partly offset by declines in cookies. Our Goldfish business had a particularly strong quarter with double-digit sales growth.","Turning to developing markets, we drove organic sales growth in Malaysia, but we're continuing to keep a close eye on Indonesia where the challenging economic conditions we outlined in September continue to impact our business. As we stated at that time, we believe it's important for Campbell to become more geographically diverse, despite short-term economic pressure in developing markets.","Our third division is Campbell Fresh, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. Here, we're focused on accelerating sales growth and expanding into new packaged fresh CPG categories. Reported segment sales increased 8% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 3%. Let's take a closer look at what drove the decline.","In Bolthouse Farms, we delivered mid single-digit sales growth in the CPG business, behind premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings, as we cycled double-digit growth in the prior year. However, these gains were more than offset by declines in our Farms business, which includes our fresh retail carrots business, where we're the market leader, and our ingredients business. Sales were down in carrots, although we grew share.","As a reminder, carrots are an important business in that they provide both scale in produce and an effective refrigerated logistics system for our CPG business. The main culprit of the sales decline was the ingredients business. As we discussed at our Investor Day in July, the carrot concentrate business began softening last year due to weak demand in Japan. That softness accelerated in the first quarter. We expect the rate of decline in ingredients to moderate, especially in the back half of the year.","While this is not the growth profile we expect from this division, we remain enthusiastic about C-Fresh and especially the CPG business. We have compelling brands, delicious products, a steady stream of on-trend innovation, investments to expand juice and salad dressing capacity, and a strong team leading the business. We expect sales in our packaged fresh CPG business to accelerate as the year progresses, driven by the continued expansion of 1915, our cold-pressed ultra-premium juice line, and the strong spring innovation suite for super premium beverages and salad dressings.","Now a word on Garden Fresh Gourmet. The integration into C-Fresh is on track and there have been no major surprises. As we outlined in July at our Investor Day meeting, we're focused on driving distribution and increasing market penetration beyond its Midwest stronghold.","Before wrapping up, I want to spend a moment on our cost savings initiative. We remain focused on transforming our cost structure and creating an ownership mindset, where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. Our streamlined organization, our ZBB efforts and our integrated global services organization are all having a positive impact on both our cost and our culture.","I'm very pleased with our progress in all these areas, particularly in IGS. This group is key to driving cost savings and building new capabilities. But IGS is about more than efficiency and effectiveness. Beyond the cost savings and capability building underway, IGS is helping to spur significant cultural change by fundamentally altering the way work is performed at Campbell.","Looking at our three new divisions and IGS, it's still early days and we have more work ahead of us to fully unlock the potential of our redesigned enterprise structure. But we're off to a solid start. Today, we're better positioned to execute against the four strategic imperatives we outlined in July.","First, we're leveraging our purpose, real food that matters for life's moments, as a filter for strategic decisions. For example, we've made recipe changes to several of our core North America products and we continue to engage consumers in open dialogue about the ingredients we use and the rationale behind our decisions as we strive to set the standard for transparency in the food industry.","Second, we're shifting more of our marketing budget to digital channels and remain committed to growing our e-commerce capabilities. Third, we're advancing health and well-being imperative across our company. Our new 1915 ultra-premium juices are meeting our expectations and we've had other recent successes including Campbell Organic Soups and the distribution of carrot snacks into the New York City School Lunch Program. And finally, we remain focused on expanding in developing markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, with an emphasis on Malaysia and Indonesia. In China, we've added resources to expand Kelsen in anticipation of a positive Chinese New Year.","In summary, these are unprecedented times of change marked by challenging economic conditions. In the food world, consolidation and intensified competition are disrupting and altering the landscape. At Campbell, we remain clear-eyed about our challenges, focused on the consumer, responsive to our customers, and dedicated to delivering against our purpose. I'm confident the actions we're taking will set Campbell apart from other food companies and strengthen our growth trajectory over time.","I look forward to answering your questions, but now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results and updated guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise mentioned, organic sales were in line with our expectations after lapping a solid year-ago quarter. We made good progress on gross margin, which increased 260 basis points on an adjusted basis, benefiting from net price realization and supply chain performance while cost inflation moderated. I'm very pleased with the progress we're making against our cost reduction initiatives, delivering $30 million of savings in the first quarter, ahead of our expectations, and as I'll share later, allowing us to raise our 2016 savings target.","Our improved outlook for cost inflation and additional cost savings will enable us to both fund investments in longer term innovation and raise our full year guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. And since we last updated you, we are experiencing an additional 1 point of headwind from currency translation across the P&L as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen.","Lastly, as we indicated on our fourth quarter call, we have changed our reporting segments to align with our three new divisions and changed our method of accounting for pension and post-retirement benefits, both of which I will cover in my comments. I'll begin with the benefit accounting change and then discuss our results and updated guidance.","To provide greater transparency into our financial results, we are changing our method of accounting for pension and post-retirement benefits. Previously, actuarial gains and losses were deferred and amortized into earnings over several years. In our case, we have been amortizing significant actuarial losses which arose over time, primarily from declining interest rates.","Under the new mark-to-market method, which has been applied to all prior periods, actuarial gains and losses will be recognized immediately into earnings rather than amortized. We will identify the mark-to-market adjustment as an item impacting comparability and excluded from our adjusted results. Mark-to-market adjustments are recognized on remeasurement dates typically year end.","What's shown on this chart is the impact on our fiscal 2015 full year and first quarter adjusted results from removing the actuarial loss amortization. Recasting our full year 2015 results increases adjusted gross margin by 70 basis points, adjusted EBIT by $97 million and adjusted EPS by $0.19. For the first quarter of 2015, the impact is an increase of 60 basis points on gross margin, $21 million of EBIT, or $0.04 per share. It is important to note that the benefit accounting change has no impact on cash flow.","In the presentation of our first quarter 2016 results and guidance, all comparisons to 2015 are against this recasted 2015 adjusted base.","Unrelated to the change in benefit accounting method I just described, we are required to remeasure certain U.S. pension plans quarterly during 2016, as a result of a program in which we offered and paid lump sums to plan participants no longer with the company. This remeasurement led to a mark-to-market loss of $0.26 per share in the first quarter.","For the first quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2%, to $2.2 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year, as net price realization from both higher list prices and lower promotional spending was offset by lower volumes.","Reflecting a 440 basis point increase in margin, adjusted EBIT increased 23% to $479 million, benefiting from a higher gross margin percentage, savings from our cost reduction initiative, and lower advertising reflecting a shift in spending to later in the year. These positive drivers were partly offset by currency translation, which had a 4 point negative impact on EBIT, the equivalent of $0.03 per share. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.95. Just to be clear, EPS growth on an adjusted basis is not impacted by the accounting change, but reflects improved operating performance of the business.","Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, reported net sales declined 2%, with organic sales comparable to the prior year. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by U.S. soup within Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, and the carrot ingredients business within Campbell Fresh. Higher selling prices in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages contributed 1 point, reflecting our pricing actions on Condensed Soup, Prego Pasta Sauce, and Foodservice in the U.S. and across the Canadian portfolio. Lower promotional spending in Global Biscuits and Snacks also added 1 point to sales growth. Currency translation had an adverse impact of 3 points on the top line.","Our two primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both declined against the U.S. dollar. To complete the bridge, our most recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, contributed 1 point to net sales in the quarter.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 260 basis points, to 37.9%, exceeding our expectations of lower than anticipated cost inflation and improved supply chain performance. Within inflation and other, which negatively impacted margin by 20 basis points, cost inflation of approximately 1% was mostly offset by improved supply chain performance, primarily in the areas of transportation and warehousing. Mix was slightly negative, reflecting a small, negative impact from the acquisition.","In aggregate, our price realization actions contributed 1.3 points of margin expansion, with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm and U.S. soup, and 90 basis points from higher selling prices. Lastly, we're off to a strong start on our supply chain productivity programs, which contributed 160 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter.","Excluding items impacting comparability, marketing and selling expenses declined 15% in the quarter, primarily due to lower advertising spending, savings from our cost reduction initiatives, and the impact of currency translation. The decline in advertising reflects a shift in the timing of our spending, principally in U.S. soup, to later in the year. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 8%, primarily due to savings from our cost reduction program and the impact of currency translation.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. As you can see, in aggregate, adjusted EPS increased $0.17 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.78 to $0.95 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT, mostly from the gross margin expansion, contributed $0.23 to EPS growth. The impact on share repurchases under our strategic repurchase program reduced our share count and added $0.01.","Going the other way, net interest expense increased $3 million, about $0.01 per share, as we extended the maturity on the debt portfolio. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1%, up 2.2 points versus the prior year, primarily due to our geographic mix and higher U.S. state taxes in 2016, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.03. Currency had a $0.03 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.95 per share.","Beginning in 2016, we are aligning our reporting segments with our new division structure. We are now reporting our results in three segments. Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. In connection with our change in benefit accounting, we have modified our method of allocating pension and post-retirement benefit costs to the segments. In 2016, only the service cost representing the value of the retirement benefit earned in the period is allocated to segments. The other elements of expense, including interests costs on the liability, expected return on assets, and actuarial gains and losses are reflected in unallocated corporate expense. As previously mentioned, we will identify the mark-to-market adjustments as an item impacting comparability and exclude them from our adjusted results.","We have adjusted our historical results to reflect these changes with fiscal 2015 sales, operating earnings and margin by segment shown on this chart. Immediately following the filing of our first quarter 10-Q, we will also provide recasted historical annual and quarterly results, including quarterly results for our segments reflecting the benefit accounting changes.","Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 1%, to $1.3 billion. U.S. soup sales decreased 3%, reflecting declines in ready-to-serve soups and broth, partly offset by gains in condensed soup. Impacted by our list price actions and changes to our promotional programs, soup volumes, as expected, were negatively impacted. Sales of U.S. beverages declined slightly, primarily due to declines in V8 V-Fusion beverages, partly offset by gains in V8 Splash.","Sales of other U.S. simple meals increased, driven by Prego Pasta Sauces, Campbell's Dinner Sauces, and our new Prego and Pace Ready Meals. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales in Canada increased driven by gains in soup. Operating earnings increased 19%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization and improved supply chain performance, particularly in the areas of transportation and warehousing, and also from lower marketing and selling expenses. Our advertising expenditures were down in the quarter as we've shifted the timing of our activity to later in the fiscal year.","Within U.S. soup, the 3% sales decline was driven by a 10% decline in ready-to-serve soup and a 9% decline in Swanson broth, offset by a 2% gain on condensed. Sales of our Fresh-Brewed Soups for Keurig, which are not part of the wet soup category, contributed 50 basis points of growth to total U.S. soup in the quarter. We began and ended the quarter with retailer inventories in aggregate comparable to year-ago levels.","With the formation of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment and our efforts to diversify the portfolio beyond soup, we do not believe subcategory sales performance in soup is as meaningful a disclosure. We will continue to provide this information for the balance of the year before discontinuing in fiscal 2017.","Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending November 1, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, unchanged versus the prior year.","In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2%, with growth in Pepperidge Farm in the Asia Pacific region. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by Goldfish crackers, fresh bakery and frozen products, partly offset by a decline in cookies. In the Asia Pacific region, excluding the impact of currency translation, growth in Australia biscuits from savory and sweet varieties were offset by declines in Indonesia biscuits, as that market is facing some economic challenges. Operating earnings increased 16%, primarily driven by higher gross margin percentage, volume gains and lower selling expenses, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation.","In the Campbell Fresh segment, consistent with our expectations, organic sales decreased 3% due to anticipated declines in carrot ingredient export sales and category declines in retail carrots, partly offset by mid single-digit sales growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 11 points of sales growth to the segment. Including the acquisition, the integration of which is going well, reported segment sales increased by 8%.","Operating earnings doubled to $18 million, driven by a higher gross margin percentage and the impact of acquiring Garden Fresh Gourmet. The improvement in gross margin reflects lower carrot costs and a favorable mix impact of the growth in the higher margin beverages and salad dressing business relative to the balance of the segment.","We had strong cash flow performance in the first quarter. Cash from operations increased by $30 million to $218 million, driven by higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures increased $9 million to $71 million. We paid dividends totaling $100 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $32 million of shares in the first quarter, $25 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt was equal to the prior year at $3.8 billion as positive net cash flow generated by the business offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet.","Now I'll reveal our revised 2016 guidance. We are now forecasting lower than anticipated cost inflation and cost savings in excess of our previous target. Compared to our previous cost inflation outlook of 2% to 3%, we now expect inflation and cost of products sold to be approximately 2% and for our gross margin to increase by approximately 1 percentage point. Compared to our previous incremental cost savings goal of $60 million, we now expect to deliver savings in the range of $80 million to $100 million in fiscal 2016. Our cumulative cost savings target of $250 million through fiscal 2018 remains unchanged.","Going in the other direction, we are experiencing some headwinds on the tax line and now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 32%. And as I mentioned earlier, we also expect the negative impact of currency translation to increase to 3 points as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen.","This revised earnings guidance reflects additional investments in innovation as well as our current expectations for the performance of our business for the remainder of 2016. Relative to our previous growth rates, we are increasing adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth by 2 points to 3 points on a currency-neutral basis with an offset to sales EBIT and EPS of 1 point due to the increased negative impact of currency translation.","From the recasted 2015 base, and including a 3 point negative impact from currency, we now expect sales to change from minus 1% to 0%, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS to both increases 4% to 7%. The guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh acquisition, which adds 1 point to both sales and adjusted EBIT.","Given that there have been significant changes to our guidance, including the impact of the change in benefit accounting, we thought it would be helpful in this instance to bridge our EPS guidance in September to the revised guidance we issued today. Starting with the original guidance of $2.53 to $2.58, we've added $0.19 for the benefit accounting change and deducted the incremental currency translation headwind, which is worth $0.03 per share.","With the upside from lower than anticipated inflation and incremental cost savings, we have taken the opportunity to fund additional investments in longer term innovation. The improved operating performance, net of the additional investments, is adding $0.06 to $0.09 to the guidance. Relative to our first quarter EPS growth, keep in mind that about half the Q1 EPS growth comes from marketing timing, which we anticipate will be spent back in the year-to-go period.","That concludes my remarks and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.","Kenneth Gosnell","Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we own limited time, out of fairness to others - to other callers, please ask only one question at a time. Okay, Stephanie.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Eric Katzman","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Eric.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi, Eric.","Eric Katzman","Happy holidays to all of you.","Denise Morrison","Thank you. You, too.","Eric Katzman","I guess with the respect for the one question, I guess, Denise and Anthony, what struck me this quarter most was how high the margins are in this simple meals area with the cost savings program versus kind of how low the margins are in the Campbell Fresh division, with obviously most of the growth expected to come in the latter. I mean, is that kind of low - the single digit kind of margin what we should assume is reasonable long term for the Fresh division? And is it - on a long-term basis, is it going to be how you balance the two to get to the consolidated goals? I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yeah, I think the one thing to point out within Campbell Fresh is you need to parse apart the components of that business. So, half the business is the CPG side, which is the beverages and salad dressing, the other half is the Farms business, which includes the carrot business and the ingredient export business. The margin structure within Campbell Fresh is very diverse.","So the CPG businesses carry a much higher margin than the carrots and natural ingredients business. And in fact, that's where all the growth is. So even within the quarter, we see gross margin expansion within Campbell Fresh because of the higher growth on the higher margin beverages and salad dressings.","So just think about the algorithm, you need to think about not just the Campbell Fresh margin but the faster growing CPG margin within that. The other thing that happens to Campbell Fresh because of the Bolthouse acquisition, it carries a pretty high load of depreciation and amortization. The EBITDA margin is about twp. times the operating margin you see on the chart. So that's another thing to keep in mind. But we think the algorithm works.","Eric Katzman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Grainger","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Denise, you've talked a lot in recent quarters about the benchmark, historically, of 24%, 25% of sales in advertising, consumer, and trade. And it seems - I know some of this is phasing just through the year, but it does seem like you're pulling back and rationalizing where you see unproductive spending across the board on all of these areas of the P&L. So, I guess, are we any closer at this point to where you might see an opportunity to shift that benchmark down slightly, or is that still the right way to think about the degree of marketing reinvestment you need in the business to drive the top line goals?","Denise Morrison","Yeah. I mean we still believe that ACT at about 24% of sales is a competitive rate. This quarter we actually spent ACT at 23% of sales. There's a number of things going on there. First of all, in the U.S. soup business, we shifted our advertising back to later in the year and started the new campaign in October versus prior years. So you're seeing the results of that.","In addition, we're shifting our spend overall to about 40% of our spend in digital, and that is creating a different dynamic between working and non-working media. And with our cost savings efforts, we're trying to be as responsible and efficient as possible in the area of non-working media. And when you shift to digital, you're spending a lot of time and expense on content, but TV is just a different dynamic.","And then within trade, we have been increasing trade on a couple businesses, in Biscuits and Campbell Fresh, and we actually took pricing in our soup business. So, we'll be working our merchandising and promotion programs with more acceleration in the second quarter and the third quarter.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Thanks, Denise. I guess I'll stop there.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citigroup. Your line is open.","David Driscoll","Thank you and good morning, everybody.","Denise Morrison","Hi, David.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning, David.","David Driscoll","I'd say I'd like to wish happy holidays to you all as well. Wanted to just ask kind of one question on soup, and apologies, Ken, just a couple of minor points here. Just overall, the ready-to-serve performance, certainly quite weak. I know you hate talking about weather, but does it matter at all about kind of the temperatures that we saw in the quarter? Would that give us any explanation here?","And then the second part of this question on soup is, is the performance here kind of indicative of maybe - maybe not this negative on some pieces of it, but just that you're going to really manage this soup business for cash, and this is really almost the philosophies of zero-based budgeting kind of coming through where we're going to get some really nice answers on the profit line but maybe the sales line is just fundamentally going to see some weakness as you rationalize unprofitable promotions, et cetera? So those two pieces, if you will.","Denise Morrison","Okay. I'll take that one. First of all, the soup business declined 2% after wrapping 6% increases in the year-ago comps. And what we believe drove that - and that was as expected, by the way - was the pricing increases that we took, which predominantly affected the RTS business; the fact that promotions have been shifted to later in the year; and the fact that advertising started later in October.","The consumption was down in line with our expectations. I would say to you that RTS is a bit worse, condensed a bit better and broth was pretty flat. But the category was down 4%. Although I'm not a weather person, I do think that that was a factor, but I believe that all these other dynamics going on were equal factors to that one.","And then, of course, our Fresh-Brewed Soup is not captured in our consumption, that's in dry soup. Inventories were comparable. We saw a little bit of a difference in broth because we carried some extra inventory into the year as we transitioned to a new screw cap on the aseptic broth. We still expect soup to grow modestly, and that is basically how we're looking at it.","David Driscoll","Okay. Thanks for the comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hey, Rob.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Rob.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Obviously, the gross margin performance was a lot higher than what anyone had expected. The guidances for 100 basis points for the year, though, I think you're up 300 basis points versus year ago already. So, why not higher, Anthony? Is it a function of the promo spending that's going to start increasing in second quarter, or is it a function of, by fourth quarter, I think you start lapping some of the supply chain improvements? Why not higher?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yeah, I guess there's a couple of comments, and I'm sure you guys will do the math. But following a 260 basis point improvement in the first quarter, driven by primarily net price realization and our productivity gains, getting to a full point on the year would imply, for the last three quarters, about 40 basis points of expansion. And there's a couple of points I would make.","I said in my comments that cost inflation was 1% in the quarter. We expect that to be closer to 2% by the time we finish the year. And that includes this negative currency impact on the input cost of some of our international businesses, primarily the Canadian business and the Australian business. So that headwind is out there. You made a comment about some of the marketing timing, the favorability in the first quarter, that'll come back in the last three quarters.","The second quarter comp is not too difficult, but it will start to lap some of the gross margin gains we had last year in the back half. So, all those things taken together would dampen that growth in the year-to-go period.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you very much.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks.","Kenneth Gosnell","Good morning, Jason.","Jason English","Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to come back to some of the trade budget optimization questions and some of the comments you made. As we look at the data, TBO seems to be a very big opportunity for you in soup and some of your other simple meals categories, yet it's been a source of leakage for you for a number of years. And I heard a reference to maybe a little bit less trade this quarter on soup, but I also thought I heard reference to actually increasing those fresh funds to mitigate some of the price increases you had going forward.","So, A, is that right, that you are going to ramp more trade to deal back some of the price increases? B, do you concur with the broader observation that there seems to be a big opportunity to pull some of these inefficient dollars out? And then, C, what's the obstacle? What's the hang-up for getting this going in the right direction for you?","Denise Morrison","I believe that we have an opportunity as a company to get a better return on our trade dollars invested. And I'd like to think of it that way. We, as part of our restructure within our Integrated Global Services, are building our revenue management capabilities, not only in the Americas business, but across all three. And we have different dynamics - competitive dynamics that we're dealing with.","I think the second goal is we are getting better net price realization. That has come from not only list price increases, but also working with promoted pricing. These are still early days and we want to make sure that the consumer responds to them well, they've been accepted by customers. And we're trying to find win-win solutions for ourselves and our customers with our trade programs. So, that's basically where we are right now, and we will definitely keep a close eye on it.","Jason English","Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney","Hey, Denise. Thanks very much for the question. I wanted to ask a little bit bigger picture question in light of -your comments today, obviously, some strong gross margin here, and I think a lot of the questions were sort of grasping at how much revenue management versus growth is your focus as a company?","And, specifically, your comment today that you want to set Campbell apart, I think you said, from other food companies, and strengthen your growth trajectory, I think you said. What metrics do you want to set Campbell apart on? I mean what should we be judging you on over the next - on what metric did you mean that Campbell would be set apart? Is it gross margin improvement? Is it operating income, segment income? What would you say to that?","Denise Morrison","I mean, we've been on a mission to generate better profitable sales growth and also, at the same time, unlock the potential of our purpose and set a new standard for transparency in the industry, which we believe will help us in achieving that trajectory of profitable net sales growth. That hasn't really changed, but it has been refined in the fact that we now have assigned the portfolio roles to the divisions, and we believe that in composite, it better diversifies our portfolio to gain that.","I think we've guided with our long-term targets as to what we believe we can achieve in the next several years, and we're still working our way into those. We believe that organic growth will be an important part of this. But also, we continue to look and be very disciplined about making strategic acquisitions.","Jonathan Feeney","So, I guess - so it's pretty much just a long-term guidance you're talking about, that sort of commentary just maybe setting Campbell apart from the other food companies doesn't relate directly to the sort of financial metrics, maybe the transparency you're providing or other things?","Denise Morrison","I'm not sure [indiscernible].","Jonathan Feeney","Well, I guess what I'm saying, Denise, is, the long-term guidance you have is pretty similar to what a lot of other companies have. And I hear you have some - I see you have some strong results today, and I think you've been very - some interesting things going on in the portfolio, and I guess I'm trying to see if there's something new afoot here, or just maybe a new level of steps behind what you've talked about for some time.","Denise Morrison","No, I think our strategy's been pretty consistent. I mean we're establishing a real beachhead in fresh food, bringing Campbell's suite of capabilities to that faster growing part of the food business. We are being really transparent about our products with our new website, whatsinmyfood.com. We are talking to consumers about what's in our food, and the ingredients we use, and how it's made. And these are just steps that really distinguish us and are very true to activating our purpose with the consumer.","And from all our research, whether it be with millennials or even baby boomers now, consumers are going to purchase the products from companies that align with their values. And we believe we have a very strong statement out there.","Jonathan Feeney","I see what you're saying. Thanks very much. It's very helpful. Happy holidays.","Denise Morrison","Thank you. You too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe, with Stifel. Your line is open.","Christopher Growe","Hi. Good morning.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi, Chris.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe","Hi, and happy holidays as well to you. Just had a quick question for you here. I want to understand in the soup business, so inventory levels were in line with the prior year, if I heard you correctly there, Anthony. Does that mean that they are up a little bit from where they were at the end of Q4? I'm just trying to get a sense of where they stand today and how to expect that to move going forward.","And then when I look within the performances of condensed, ready-to-serve and broth, condensed is the one that seems to stand out a bit versus what like the measured channel data indicated. So, is that the one where - was there a little inventory increase in condensed in the quarter, is also part of the question.","Anthony DiSilvestro","So, to the first part of the question. We always build retail inventories in the first quarter. So we always come into the quarter relatively low. We're getting into the season and we always build. The question then becomes, did you build more than you did the year-ago period? The answer to that, in aggregate, is no. The retailer inventories on a case basis, we came into the quarter and ended the quarter about the same.","And then if you look underneath that by subcategory, I would say that condensed and RTS got a little bit of benefit, and broth saw a little bit of a negative in terms of impact of shifts within the portfolio. But I think where we ended the quarter is kind of a normal place for us relative to the seasonal build we typically see in the business.","Denise Morrison","Just another build on what Anthony said, our sales on broth in the quarter were down 9% and we were cycling comps of plus 17% a year ago. And our consumption in the quarter was flat. So that also was a factor to evaluate the performance.","Christopher Growe","So in the context of your promotional spending plans, usually your promotional spending is working down, as I think it did this quarter, a bit, you tend to see inventories come out of the system. Is that what you'd expect for the year then, or can you go that far to speak to that?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yeah. By the time we cycled the full year and we get to the end of the fourth quarter, it's typically our low point in the cycle. So all of this stuff that happens as we build into the season, come out of the season, generally works its way out by the time we get to the end of the fourth quarter.","Christopher Growe","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi. So can I ask about some other parts of the business, specifically V8, cookies and then SpaghettiOs, which I know is fairly small. But in each of those, it's a similar pattern to what we're seeing in soup. You seem to be trading off market share in exchange for better EBIT and better price realization. Should we expect those trends to continue or are you scrambling to try to turn it around? I'm just trying to get an idea of the strategy there. And then just some comments on SpaghettiOs, it looks as though even before the recall, the sales were really coming down quite heavily. Is that something you're kind of pulling away from? Thank you.","Denise Morrison","Let me tackle beverages first. The category continues to remain challenged, although we have seen some signs of improvement. Our consumption and share were down slightly in quarter one. We have a couple puts and a couple takes. V8 Splash and V8 + Energy continue to perform well and we're very encouraged by our V8 Veggie Blends launch. And we've had a bit of decline on our V8 red juice, and I think that's due to consumers trying some different types of vegetable juice now in the Veggie Blend line. And our V8 V-Fusion business continues to be a challenge.","And we've had a couple quarters of good growth in immediate consumption and we had some trade timing issues in the quarter, so that was down about 1%, but our equivalent volume in that channel was up 8%. So we continue to be encouraged about the new network we've set up there. We know that's an opportunity for us. And finally, we launched our Veggies For All campaign and we really like what that's doing for the brand in terms of the equity. So we're still very committed to the V8 program. We think it's a timely, on-trend brand for the health conscious consumer that offers a lower calorie option and less sugar option in this world of juice.","Cookies, we saw - no pun intended - we saw a softness on our cookies, predominantly in the classic line. However, we did have a really, really good quarter on Goldfish crackers, up 10%. So, we still have some more work to do on cookies. And SpaghettiOs...","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yeah, I can do that.","Denise Morrison","Yeah, go ahead.","Anthony DiSilvestro","The premise of the question I would disagree with a little bit. I mean the price realization on soup is relatively unique to soup. We haven't done a lot of price realization on V8, cookies or SpaghettiOs. SpaghettiOs sales are relatively flat in the quarter. V8's down, it's primarily a V8 V-Fusion issue, and as Denise mentioned, Chunk cookies are a particular issue within the Pepperidge Farm portfolio that we're addressing, but we haven't made a strategic decision in those businesses to go for price realization and better EBIT in exchange for market share.","Alexia Howard","Okay, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Denise Morrison","Hi, David.","David Palmer","Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving.","Denise Morrison","You too.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Happy Thanksgiving.","David Palmer","Just to follow up there on your crackers business and, particularly, you mentioned Goldfish being strong. That's been a tough category for a lot of companies, the healthy snacking area. What's, perhaps, going right there for you? And how confident are you that you can keep that going? And then, on cookies, that's become tougher for a variety of players there, and seems like sweet snacks in general has been tough. What is the plan for that segment? Thanks.","Denise Morrison","Yeah. We definitely have been very focused on keeping our Goldfish programming strong. I think that that business is hitting on all cylinders with good advertising, a good promotional program, and the right proposition for millennial parents and their children. So, we continue to be pretty excited about our Goldfish business. And I think that mothers still feel like that is a very positive snacking for their children.","I think we have more work to do on cookies, and we're working on that as we speak. We do have new leadership right now in the Pepperidge Farm business, and that team is really coming together and focusing on the next wave of innovation of ideas. And I'm not sure there's anything more to add to that.","David Palmer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta, with Barclays. Your line is open.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Thank you for taking the question. Was hoping you would talk a little bit about your view on the current rate environment. Specifically, you had $1.5 billion in short-term borrowings. Do you expect to continue rolling in this market or refinance it?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yeah. So, as I mentioned, we did term out some of the debt portfolio in the recent past, taking advantage of relatively low fixed rates. We have a sizable backstop credit facility against a commercial paper program, and we're fairly comparable with the level of CP we have in the marketplace today. I mean, clearly, with what's happening in the credit markets, we continue to look at that and evaluate alternatives, whether to term out some of that CP, or whether to use the derivative market to convert some of the that floating exposure to fixed, but that's kind of an ongoing thing that we continue to assess here.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Thank you very much.","Anthony DiSilvestro","You're welcome.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Kenneth Gosnell","All right, thank you, Stephanie. From all of us at Campbell, Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce to your host for today's conference, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the Campbell Soup Company's second quarter earnings call and webcast. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO, Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, CFO and Chief Administrative Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations.","I am going to comment first on some very exciting items impacting comparability in the quarter. Denise will follow me with a high level her perspective on our second quarter and first-half. Craig will wrap it up with a more detailed look at the financial and segment results. After that we will take your questions.","As usual, we have created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com and on our IR app which is available through Google or Apple. Please keep in mind that our call is open to members of the media who are participating in listen-only mode.","Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. They reflect the company's current expectations about future plans and performance. Our forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to slide three in the presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements.","In the second quarter of fiscal 2014, Campbell and a joint venture partner agreed to restructure manufacturing and streamline operations in China. We recorded pretax restructuring charges of $13 million related to this initiative. In the first quarter, we recorded pretax restructuring charges and related costs of $23 million associate with initiatives to streamline our salaried workforce in North America and in Asia-Pacific and the previously announced initiative.","We recorded a loss of $9 million on foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge the proceeds from the sale of our European Simple Meals business. In addition, we recorded tax expense of $7 million associated with that sale. Last year in the second quarter we recorded a pretax restructuring charge and related costs of $48 million related to our U.S. supply chain in Mexico. In the first quarter we recorded $10 million in transaction cost to Bolthouse and $43 million in restructuring charges and related costs related to U.S. supply chain initiatives.","Since our presentation today includes non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation. These slides along with our earnings release and selected quarterly financials also can be found on our website accessible by computer or any mobile device with the Campbell IR app.","As Denise will touch on later too, Campbell recently announced a CFO transition. Craig Owens, CFO since October 2008 will be retiring on May 1, 2014. He has been not only a strong and respected CFO but also an outstanding mentor to me and many others here at Campbell. On behalf of all of us who have had the privilege to work with the master Craig, I would like to thank you for that.","So we are delighted to add that Anthony DiSilvestro is being promoted to CFO. He will be providing the financials perspective at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference, CAGNY, in Florida on February 19 with Craig, Denise and I attending as well. We invite interested shareholders, investors, members of the media and consumers to listen to and view our investor presentation at CAGNY which will be videocast live, it is actually videocast at 10:30 AM Eastern from Boca Raton. A replay of the video and copies of materials will be available afterwards on Campbell's website archives.","With that, let me turn it over to Denise Morrison.","Denise Morrison","Thank you, Jennifer and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining Campbell's second quarter earnings call. I would like to cover three topics this morning. I will share my perspective on our second quarter and first-half results, update you on the unusual factors that negatively impacted our first quarter and how those played out in the second quarter and discuss our plans to drive stronger growth in the second-half to deliver our full-year guidance. Craig will then provide details on our segment results.","Despite facing headwinds from a weaker retail and consumer environment, we continue to reshape our company for longer-term higher growth while at the same time balancing short-term deliverables. In the second quarter, we delivered growth of 6% in reported net sales, 15% in adjusted EBIT and 19% in adjusted EPS from continuing operations which increased to $0.76. Clearly we have made progress from our disappointing start in the first quarter. Our improved results were driven by growth in our core business and from acquisitions. We delivered 3% organic sales growth in our core business led by higher sales in U.S. Simple Meals Pepperidge Farm and Bolthouse Farms.","Acquisitions also contributed to our growth, led by Kelsen, which we acquired in the first quarter to give us a growth platform in China and other developing markets. Kelsen was the main catalyst of our 14% growth in global baking and snacking and contributed to the higher operating earnings. We had a strong holiday season in U.S. Soup and Pepperidge Farm but January was weaker than expected. During the quarter we also closed the sale of our European Simple Meals business.","Let me take you through the four factors that negatively impacted our first quarter performance and explain how those factors played out this quarter. As we said in November, those Q1 drivers were movements in inventory levels by U.S. retailers and program timing, weakness in our core business trends, our decision to frontload marketing spending in Q1 to support new products in Soup and Simple Meals and build the Bolthouse Farms brand and our voluntary recall of a range of Plum Organics products.","We said in November that we expected a positive impact on second quarter results as some of these drivers reversed. This in fact happens. Looking first at inventory movements. Our U.S. Soup business benefited from positive retailer inventory movements in the second quarter as we anticipated. That, with the change from Q1, grew retailer inventory declines and higher levels coming into the year combined with later holiday timing, hurt our Q1 results especially in Soup. Reflecting the reversal in inventory pressures, U.S. Soup shipments increased in the second quarter driving 5% sales growth.","The late timing of the Thanksgiving holiday season also helped U.S. Soup and Pepperidge Farm as it pushed shipments into the second quarter as we expected. We had strong sales and consumption during the holiday season and well executed holiday programs. For the quarter, sales of Campbell's condensed cooking soups grew double digits and Swanson broth was on fire up 21%. We also grew sales of Pepperidge Farm bread and stuffing.","Let's look more closely at the second factor that we discussed back in November. Our core business trends. In the second quarter our core business performance improved especially in U.S. Simple Meals which delivered 7% growth in sales and 12% growth in earnings. This performance reflected growth in Soup, the acquisition of Plum Organics and higher sales of sauces including our new innovation with Prego white sauces and Campbell's dinner sauces. As we said in November we begin the fiscal year with the soup promotion plan that was more heavily weighted to the second and third quarters.","Despite strong holiday consumption, we didn't get the overall lift in soup that we had anticipated in the quarter from the balance of promotions. This caused soup shipments in the quarter to be ahead of consumption which was down more than a point for the quarter. As a result we ended the second quarter with inventory levels that were elevated from the year earlier quarter. So while we delivered on some soup sales, we are far from satisfied with the category consumption and our consumption performance. Accordingly we have more aggressive plans in the second-half as I will explain in a few minutes.","Turning to Pepperidge Farm. We delivered 5% growth in Goldfish in the second quarter including crackers and our new Goldfish Puffs. Sales of Pepperidge Farm cookies increased with growth in Dessert Shop cookies. Fresh bakery delivered solid performance as the business continues to innovate and leverage our shelf space gains. Sales in Bolthouse Farms increased 6% with double digit growth in its premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. Bolthouse Farms continues to launch innovative new beverage products supported by increased merchandising. We continue to increase beverage assortment in the retail perimeter while we are still expanding points of distribution for salad dressings.","Our core U.S. beverage business and our business in Australia continue to face challenges. We told you previously that we don't expect U.S. beverages and our Australian business to be growth drivers this year and that hasn't changed. But we have taken several important steps in recent months to change the leadership in both of these businesses and build a stronger foundation for future growth. In U.S. beverages, the second quarter sales decline was largely driven by our planned transition from the Coke distribution system for our single-serve V8 beverages.","Our five-year distribution agreement with Coke concluded on December 31, after both companies elected not to renew the agreement for strategic reasons. We have established a new national distributor network for immediate consumption supported by a new sales team. We started shipping in January to our new distributors who are energized and focused on driving growth. Over time, we see immediate consumption as a significant opportunity for expansion for both V8 and Bolthouse Farms. In our V8 business overall, we are seeing improved trends in our V8 100% vegetable juice and continued growth in V8 V-Fusion + Energy.","In Australia we brought in new leadership, developed a more focused plan for our core biscuit business and implemented initiatives to drive productivity in that market. Restoring growth in this important business is a work in progress that will take time.","The third factor recited was frontloaded marketing to support new products. We told you in the first quarter that our advertising and consumer spend increased 14% to support new products like Campbell's Homestyle soup and Campbell's dinner sauces. In Q1 we also made our first brand building investment behind Bolthouse Farms. We knew these upfront marketing investments would negatively impact earnings in the first quarter but our decision has helped to accelerate these brands.","Looking at our marketing spend in the second quarter, advertising and consumer promotion for the total company increased 3% including acquisitions. We are delivering solid performance in Campbell's Skillet sauces and Slow Cooker sauces. Our dinner sauces are delivering incremental sales in this new category. We are steadily building trial with very good repeat purchase rates in consumer groups including both younger and more affluent consumers.","Campbell's Homestyle ready-to-serve soup continues to expand distribution and improve velocity. Homestyle was introduced following the discontinuation of our 100% natural RTS. This transition narrowed our shelf presence because Homestyle was launched with fewer items. Going forward we expect to gain back shelf space as we build out the line and introduce new products in the back-half. The marketing investments behind Bolthouse Farms are raising consumer awareness of this wonderful brand as we aim to expand its position in the $12 billion packaged fresh category. We were pleased with Bolthouse Farms' solid performance in the second quarter across all of its segments.","The final driver we discussed in November was the voluntary recall of some Plum Organic products. In the first quarter the company recognized $16 million in cost associated with the recall. We moved quickly in the second quarter to address the manufacturing defect that led to that recall. The acquisition of Plum which we completed last June contributed half of our 16% growth in U.S. sauces in the second quarter. We believe that Plum, which we will continue to integrate, is well positioned for a more significant sales contribution in the second-half.","So to briefly summarize, the first quarter inventory headwind reversed much as we anticipated. The Plum recall is behind us. We feel good that we will obtain a return on the step that advertising. Our core business however remains a bit behind our expectations for the first-half of the year for the reasons I just enumerated. So looking at the first-half, it was a tale of two cities. We got off to a slow start but recovered in the second quarter as we said we would. In the first-half, net sales from continuing operations increased 2%, adjusted EBIT declined 5% and adjusted EPS decreased 4%.","While we made substantial progress in the second quarter, we didn't expect to make up all the growth that we lost in the first quarter. We recognize that we must deliver strong results in the second-half to achieve our full-year guidance. In the second-half, we expect to grow organic sales by around 2% and acquisitions should contribute about 3% to our sales growth. For the full-year, the extra week in the fiscal year will largely be offset by currency.","So how are we can deliver this growth? Let me start by giving some highlights of our plans in U.S. Soup and Simple Meals. We expect U.S. Soup to deliver modest growth in the second-half of the year. We have a strong promotional calendar in the third quarter and marketing in place to drive soup consumption in the back-half of the year. We also expect our U.S. soup business to benefit from eight new soups that we launched in January under an accelerated timeframe. These include our first Latin inspired cooking soups, new pub inspired varieties of Campbell's chunky soup and new Healthy Request varieties. By comparison we didn't launch any new soups in the second-half last year.","In Broth, we expect to drive continued growth in Swanson with strong Easter programs. Importantly, we expect other businesses to contribute more significantly to growth in the second-half while soup does its part. In Simple Meals, we will continue to build momentum in Campbell dinner sauces. We have already created separate shell sections for this new category in approximately 50% of the ACV. We aim to drive continued growth in Prego with more advertising in new products including expanded presence in white sauces, a space we weren't competing in a year ago. And we expect Plum Organics to show improvement from the first-half with the full product range back in supply, expanded distribution and several new products.","In Global Baking and Snacking we expect Pepperidge Farm to deliver stronger growth in snacks in the second-half. We have plans to drive Goldfish with aggressive promotional activity, increased customer supported merchandising and accelerated channel expansion. Pepperidge Farm will increase innovation with new varieties and types of Goldfish, the national rollout of Goldfish mac and cheese and further expansion of Goldfish Puffs. We will continue to expand Dessert Shop cookies with new varieties and we will launch coffee shop cookies indulgent morning offerings.","Internationally we expect to deliver double-digit growth in sweet biscuits in Indonesia and we are focused on marketing Tim Tam, Shapes and Arnott's sweet biscuits in Australia with increased advertising and consumer promotion and strong customer programs. After delivering solid second quarter results, we expect a strong second-half from Bolthouse Farms. We have one of the most exciting spring innovation line-ups in Bolthouse's history with marketing support and plans to launch a number of new beverages and delicious salad dressings.","Although U.S. beverages won't be a growth engine, we do expect to see improved sales and immediate consumption channels over time as we fully develop our new national distributor network which has been established and is operative. We are also expanding V8 V-Fusion refreshers and we expect continued growth in energy drinks which are performing very well. Across our portfolio, we will be intensely focused on driving productivity and managing expense in our global supply chain. We expect to deliver improved gross margin trends in the second-half and Craig will discuss why we expect profits to be better.","For the full-year, we continue to expect to deliver net sales growth of 4% to 5%, adjusted EBIT growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 2% to 4%. We know it will require strong execution against the drivers of demand. We know it will demand operating discipline and we know that we must have a resolute focus on accelerating stronger, profitable growth across our core business while we continue to integrate our acquisitions. We don't expect to get everything back in the third quarter. It will take a strong fourth quarter performance as well.","We are in the midst of a turbulent period. Retailers are wrestling with challenged consumers who remain under pressure and consumer behavior is becoming less predictable. We believe the weakness that Campbell and other food companies experienced in January was partially related to the extreme weather conditions which dealt a blow to the U.S. economy. We expect to be competing in a more typical environment over the remainder of the year. Obviously if the environment is significantly worse than we expect, then it will be tougher to reach our guidance. In summary we are optimistic about our plans for the second-half of the year and believe that with solid execution our full-year guidance is both reasonable and attainable.","Before I turn the call over to Craig Owens, I also want to thank him for his contribution to Campbell over the past five years. As we recently announced, Craig will retire from Campbell on May 1. This will be his last earnings call with us. And Craig has done an outstanding job as our CFO and Chief Administrative Officer. With his integrity, insights and expertise, he has earned the admiration and trust of our leadership team and the investment community. He will be greatly missed by all.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Craig.","Craig Owens","Well, thanks, Denise. It's really been my pleasure to work with Campbell's and to be a part of your management team. I feel really good about where Campbell is and where it's going and I am particularly happy that Anthony is going to be our next CFO, but I am not quite done yet so let's get back to work.","Let me walk through the second quarter results, segment highlights and then a brief outlook with respect to our earnings guidance. As Jennifer mentioned, my discussion of results will exclude the impact of restructuring charges in both the current and prior year quarters, as well as the acquisition transaction costs of the prior-year. I will also exclude a loss on foreign exchange forward contracts and a tax expense related to the sale of our European business that were both recorded in continuing operations in the first quarter.","On October 28, 2013 which was the first of second quarter, the company completed the divestiture of our Simple Meals business in Europe. This business is reported in discontinued operations. In the quarter, the company recognized a net gain of $90 million after tax or $0.28 per share from that sale.","So for continuing operations, we reported second quarter net sales of $2.3 billion, a 6% increase from the prior year. These results include a five point contribution from our Kelsen and Plum Organics acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions as well as the negative impact of currency, organic net sales increased by 3% primarily driven by gains in U.S. Simple Meals. Organic sales also rose in our Global Baking and Snacking, Bolthouse and Foodservice and International Simple Meals and Beverage segments, while the U.S. Beverage sales declined for the quarter.","Adjusted EBIT increased 15% to $374 million, which includes a three point contribution from the Kelsen and Plum acquisitions. The balance of the increase was driven by lower administrative expense, higher organic sales and lower marketing expense, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.76, a 19% increase versus the prior-year driven by the EBIT increased and also benefiting from a favorable tax rate.","Slide 24 shows the composition of the 6% sales growth. The organic sales increase of three points reflects two points of favorable volume and mix and two points of growth from higher selling expense, partly offset by one point of increased promotional spending. Unfavorable currency had a two point impact due to the Australian and Canadian dollar weakening against the U.S. dollar. The favorable volume mix is driven by our U.S. Simple Meals segment.","The pricing gains were primarily related to the list price increase on U.S. condensed soup and price increases in our Baking and Snacking segment .These increases were partly offset by pricing declines in Mexico based on the new distribution model. The promotional spending variance was primarily related to higher rates of spending in Global Baking and Snacking and in U.S. Simple Meals.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 140 basis points to 35.7%. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to cost inflation, supply chain related costs including project expenses, weather related costs and higher warehousing and transportation expense and unfavorable mix partly offset by productivity improvements and higher selling prices. The ate increase in cost of goods sold was approximately 5% in the quarter, including two to three points from inflation and the balance from the supply chain cost that I cited above. This increase was partly offset by productivity savings. The increase in the cost of goods sold rate for the year is now estimated at 3% to 4% with inflation in materials, energy and labor at around to 2% to 3% and our expectation for productivity gains remains at approximately 3%.","Marketing and selling expense for the quarter decreased by $7 million to $268 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower marketing overhead expense, lower advertising and consumer promotional expenses and reduced selling expense of the negative impact of currency partly offset by the addition of Kelsen and Plum Organics. Excluding acquisitions, A&C for the quarter fell by 7% and is up 2% year-to-date as we frontloaded marketing to support new product launches.","Administrative expense decreased $21 million to $142 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation cost, lower pension expense and cost savings from recent restructuring initiatives, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions which added approximately $7 million.","For the quarter, net interest expense decreased by $2 million to $29 million. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31%, a 170 basis point decrease versus the prior year. This was primarily due to lower taxes on foreign earnings in the current quarter. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased 19% to $240 million. The share count was unchanged versus the prior-year.","Second quarter segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on slide 27. Our U.S. Simple Meals segment delivered $894 million in sales including a $17 million contribution from the acquisition of Plum. U.S. Simple Meals organic sales increased by 5%. Within the segment, U.S. Soup sales also increased by 5% benefiting from the movements in retailer inventory levels.","As we reported with our Q1 results, retailers entered the second quarter with lower inventories than prior-year. They exited the quarter with inventory somewhat higher than prior-year. Consumer takeaway in measured channels was down 1% for the quarter.","Excluding the impact of the Plum acquisition, U.S. Sauce sales increased by 8%. The increase was driven by gains in Prego pasta sauce including its new white sauces, the new Campbell's Slow Cooker sauce and Campbell's Skillet sauces.","Our Global Baking and Snacking segment delivered $639 million in sales including a $92 million contribution from Kelsen. Organic sales increased 2% versus the prior year with growth in Pepperidge Farm in Indonesia partly offset by declines in Arnott's in Australia. The sales gains in Pepperidge Farm reflected growth across fresh bakery and snacks. In the bakery business, sandwich breads and rolls posted strong gains even as most of its brands have been reintroduced in to the market. Sales in stuffing also increased for the quarter partially due to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday.","The Snacks business had another quarter of growth with increases in Goldfish snack crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies partly offset by declines in adult cracker varieties. Sales at Arnott's decreased due to declines in Australia in both chocolate and savory varieties partly offset by strong growth in Indonesia.","Our Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segment posted $359 million sales number, an increase of 2%. Sales rose 6% at Bolthouse driven by double-digit growth in premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings and single-digit growth in carrot business. Sales declined in the North America Foodservice segment principally in soup. For the first-half, Bolthouse generated $392 million in sales.","International Simple Meals and Beverages delivered $213 million in sales for the quarter. Organic sales increased by 1%. Sales gains in the Asia-Pacific region were partly offset by declines in Latin America. Sales in Canada were comparable to a year ago, as gains in snacks and soup were offset by declines in beverages. The sales decline in Latin America was due to the lower selling prices associated with the implementation of a new business model in Mexico. Sales in Asia-Pacific increased due to gains in Malaysia and Japan.","U.S. Beverage sales declined by 3% to $176 million. The decrease in sales was driven by declines across the portfolio primarily due to the impact of the transition to a new distribution network in single-serve, immediate consumption channels. In take-home channels, we saw positive trends for V8 Red and for Splash beverages.","Operating earnings for the U.S. Simple Meals segment increased 12% to $214 million. Operating earnings increased primarily due to productivity improvements, higher selling prices and lower marketing expense, partly offset by cost inflation and supply chain related costs.","Operating earnings for Global Baking and Snacking increased 19% to $88 million. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Kelsen, higher selling prices and productivity improvements, partially offset by cost inflation and higher promotional spending.","The operating expense increase reflected Kelsen's operating results and growth in Pepperidge Farm, partly offset by lower earnings in Arnott's. Kelsen's popularity during the holiday season in Asia skews its profitability heavily to the second quarter.","Within International Simple Meals and Beverages, operating earnings were $38 million, an increase of 15%. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to higher volume, lower selling and administrative cost and productivity improvements, partially offset by lower selling prices and the unfavorable impact of currency.","Operating earnings within Bolthouse and Foodservice rose by 20% to $36 million, primarily due to reduced administrative expense and productivity improvements, partially offset by cost inflation. For the first-half, Bolthouse Farms generated $32 million in EBIT.","Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages decreased by 16% to $31 million. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily driven by cost of goods.","On slide 30, you can see U.S. Soup sales increased 5%, led by broth. As expected, the year's program timing and the late Thanksgiving holiday had a very positive impact on second quarter sales.","Sales of condensed soup increased 4%, driven by double-digit gains in cooking varieties. Sales of eating varieties were comparable to the year ago quarter. Higher net pricing was partially offset by lower volumes.","Ready-to-serve soup sales were comparable to a year ago as gains in Chunky and Homestyle can soups were offset by declines in microwavable soup varieties.","Broth sales increased by 21% driven by double-digit volume gains in aseptic and canned broth.","U.S. Soup sales for the first-half decreased by 1%. The decrease was due to a 5% decline in ready-to-serve soup and a 1% decrease in condensed soup. Broth increased by 10% for the half.","On slide 31, we look at the U.S. wet soup category for the 52 weeks ended January 26, 2014 and in our share performance. The category as a whole rose 1.6%. Our sales in measured channels rose 1.9% with gains driven by ready-to-serve soup and broth. Condensed soup sales were comparable to the prior year.","Campbell had a 59.4% market share, an increase of 20 basis points, for the year. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28% and private label was at 13%. These figures were sourced from SymphonyIRI multi-outlet data and are based on dollar sales.","Our second quarter results represent a sharp improvement from the first quarter. Our position at the end of the first-half is entirely consistent with the guidance expectation we set when we reported the first quarter. For the first-half, net sales from continuing operations were $4.4 billion, a 2% increase from the prior year. These results include a four point contribution from acquisitions, which consist of Plum Organics and Kelsen, which was acquired on August 8 and one additional week of results from Bolthouse Farms, which was acquired one week into the first quarter a year ago.","Excluding acquisitions and the negative impact of currency, organic net sales decreased by 1%, driven by declines in U.S. Beverages and International Simple Meals and Beverages, partly offset by gains in Global Baking and Snacking. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year in our U.S. Simple Meals and Bolthouse and Foodservice segments.","Adjusted EBIT decreased 5% to $711 million, primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage, lower organic sales and expenses related to the Plum Organics recall, partly offset by lower administrative expense. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.42, a 4% decrease versus the prior year, driven by the EBIT decline partly offset by the lower adjusted tax rate. The composition of the 2% sales increase includes an organic sales decrease of one point, unfavorable currency of two points and an acquisition contribution of four points. The detail doesn't add because of the rounding.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 180 basis points to 35.8%. The decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to cost inflation and supply chain related cost, the impact of acquisitions and the Plum recall, partly offset by productivity improvements.","Marketing and selling expenses increased $18 million to $529 million. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of acquisitions and higher advertising and consumer promotion expense partly offset by the impact of currency and lower marketing overhead expense.","Administrative expenses decreased $28 million to $290 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation cost, lower pension expense and cost savings from recent restructuring initiatives, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions which added about $10 million.","For the first-half, net interest expense decreased by $5 million to $59 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates on our total debt portfolio and benefits from the proceeds from the sale of our European Simple Meals business partly offset by debt incurred to fund the Kelsen and Plum acquisitions.","The adjusted tax rate for the first-half was 31.6%, a 70 basis point decrease versus the prior year, primarily due to lower taxes on foreign earnings in 2014. This was partially offset by a favorable settlement of the state tax matter in 2013. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations decreased by 4% to $449 million and adjusted earnings per share from continuing ops decreased to $1.42 for the first-half.","Cash flow from operations was $363 million, compared with $499 million in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to taxes paid on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and lower cash earnings in fiscal 2014. Capital expenditure of $127 million rose from $110 million a year ago. We are still expecting capital expenditures for the year to be about $350 million.","As we previously announced, we suspended the strategic share repurchase program at the end of fiscal 2012 in order to reduce debt incurred to finance the Bolthouse acquisition. However we will continue to repurchase shares sufficient to offset dilution from equity compensation programs. Net debt has decreased by $107 million to $3.9 billion.","Results from the European Simple Meals business are reported as discontinuing operations. The company completed the divestiture of its European Simple Meals business to CVC Capital Partners on October 28. In the second quarter, the company recognized a net gain of $90 million after-tax or $0.28 per share from the sale. For the first-half, the net earnings from discontinued operations were $81 million or $0.26 per share.","Campbell reiterated our annual guidance this morning. We expect continuing operations to grow sales by 4% to 5%, adjusted EBIT by 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS by 2% to 4%. As a reminder, fiscal 2014 is comprised of 53 weeks, one additional week compared to the prior-year, the benefit of which is expected to be mostly offset by the impact of currency translation.","The contribution to sales from acquisitions is anticipated to be nearly $300 million. As we have said before, in connection with the new business model in Mexico, reported sales and cost of products sold will be reduced by approximately $35 million.","Interest expense is estimated at about $120 million for the year and the tax rate is projected to be between 31% and 32%. EPS growth reflects the impact of a significant increase in the tax rate versus an unusually low rate for the last year.","Thank you. With that, I will turn it back to Jennifer.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks Craig. At this time, we will conduct a Q&A session. We would like to request that our callers limit themselves to a single question so we can respond to more people who are on the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Good morning, everyone.","Denise Morrison","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Denise, I was hoping to get just a little more perspective from you on, I think you had said the consumption around core U.S. Soup or the lift basically that you are expecting from some of the activities you did in the quarter, didn't really have the anticipated effect. Is your sense that that was just all, sort of some of the rough weather we have been having or were there some other aspect to that that played into it?","Denise Morrison","Well, last year's weather contributed to the 5% growth, but we think it drove less than half of those gains. We believe that our improved execution and more effective marketing and the introduction of new products were the key drivers last year. This year we were really satisfied with our holiday consumption but January we did get lifts on our promotion but they weren't quite what we expected. And basically we have to do a better job in the second-half driving consumption.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","So you think the consumption or the lifts that weren't right where you wanted them was primarily just the weather we had more recently or you mean to say you didn't do a good enough? I am trying to get a sense of what didn't go as planned or where the improvements will come from?","Denise Morrison","Yes. We have assessed that weather is neutral to us in this quarter. We definitely acknowledge a benefit of cold temperatures, but we think it was offset by unfavorable weather disruptions. We had plant closures for a while, retail store closures and some lost business in the Foodservice sector.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning.","Denise Morrison","Good morning.","Craig Owens","Hi, Eric.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Craig, I don't know if you are going to be down in CAGNY, but it's been a pleasure working with you. Best of luck.","Craig Owens","Thank you. I will be at CAGNY.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay, all right. Then I will save the party until next week, I guess maybe kind of following up on Andrew's question a bit. Just a couple of points around soup. One is, how do we judge like the broth sales being so strong versus arguably the soup side of it a bit weaker and how is it that one could be so strong and the other not in the same type of environment?","Then two, you brought forward a new product soup sales from, I think what you were going to introduce them next season into this season after the fiscal first quarter and I find that to be kind of unusual to the extent that the soup category shelf set, et cetera are normally set quite early. So I am kind of wondering how effective can new products be introduced in the heart of the season when the retailers are kind of normally setting it up way ahead of time?","Denise Morrison","Okay, I will answer both. First of all on the broth business. We were very pleased with our performance on broth and we attribute it to a number of factors. First of all, starting with the consumer, we have seen an increase in homemade soup behavior, I mean people are making more soup at home and they are cooking more with broth, which is great. We do think that that's partially driven by some of the innovation we have brought to the broth segment of the soup category with new flavor infused varieties and we have also changed our advertising campaign to really emphasize insights on why I cook. We think the combination of all of those have really helped the business. As I said, we had a strong holiday.","In regards to the new off-cycle products, our retailers are looking for growth and fortunately, we now have a pipeline with more products ready to go to market. So we view this as positive because we are doing something different and continuing to increase our new surrounding soup.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay, I will pass it on. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning, folks.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","So I wanted to ask some questions on the Beverage side of your portfolio. I apologize if I missed this in prepared remarks. But can you elaborate more on your new routes to market for immediate consumption channels with V8? And also give us an update on the similar initiative that I think you have going on with Bolthouse to try to push into those channels?","Denise Morrison","Okay. We have had, for the last five-years, a contract with Coca-Cola for immediate consumption distribution of V8 and that ended on December 31. Over the last year of that contract, we have continued to work with Coke and effective January 1, we were able to ship V8 products to a new network of distributors for national distribution.","In addition, we are now out working with predominantly convenient store customers to make sure that we not only secure the V8 distribution that we had, but expand it. We now have the benefit of going to market with both V8 and Bolthouse Farms, which gives us, in total, that just both all retail channels about $1 billion of healthy beverage business.","So we feel like we have got a great program going forward on immediate consumption. It is a large part of other beverage company's sales and profits and it's a very small part of ours. So we see this as a really great opportunity for us.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Okay, and sticking on beverages. Given your relationship with Green Mountain on the soup initiative. I am curious if you could comment on your attempt with either V8 or Bolthouse Farms into its new cold beverage platform?","Denise Morrison","We continue to work with Green Mountain on the development of the new Fresh-Brewed Soup K-Cup product and we do not have plans at this point for V8 or Bolthouse Farms execution.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you, guys","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Hi, good morning.","Denise Morrison","Good morning, Chris.","Craig Owens","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Hi, look forward to seeing you at the CAGNY. Just a quick question for you, if I could, to understand the second quarter benefit you received from inventory. And really what I am trying to get to is, it sounds like inventory levels need to come down a little bit in the second-half of the year. So did you quantify or can you quantify the benefit to Q2 or maybe, what you believe would have come out in the second-half for the year?","Craig Owens","Well the benefit to Q2, I would look at that as the difference between consumption, which was down one and inventory which was up five less some of the low level that we entered the quarter with. It's hard to quantify looking forward. Remember that inventories are moving in a big bell curve through the season anyways.","So when we talk about inventory movement, we are talking about difference to prior year at the beginning and end of the quarter. But they are always coming down in the second quarter and they will be coming down in the third quarter. It depends on where we end.","I think it's fair to say, we need to get good consumption and good execution in the third quarter and get the inventory overhang that's out there consumed as we move through the quarter and that's why I mean we feel pretty good about that, as Denise referenced. We have got a lot of programming in the quarter and we are looking forward to seeing that work for us.","Denise Morrison","This is more of a program frequency than program depth too.","Jennifer Driscoll","Right. I just mentioned that. Next question.","Denise Morrison","Sorry, did you want to continue with this?","Chris Growe - Stifel","Well, that's okay. Thank you. I will leave it there.","Craig Owens","Thanks, Chris.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi , thank you. I don't claim to be the best modeler in the world, but my SG&A modeling has obviously gotten worse and worse here with Campbell and I want to know if you could help me here. Your admin costs are well below what I thought and they are well below a year ago. I know you have had some restructuring, but do you think your admin costs are going to be down year-over-year?","And then also, Craig, on the gross margin, I think last quarter you said, you expected to be slightly higher versus a year ago. You seem to be kind of angling at lower now. How much of a headwind on gross margin should we expect for the year.","Craig Owens","So, SG&A first. I think we would expect SG&A to be down versus prior year. We are benefiting from the restructuring activities that we pursued. You will continue to see benefit from that. You will see benefit from that in the second-half. Pension cost is a positive for us this year. It looks like we are headed for a little bit lower incentive compensation cost. So all of those things will run favorably and looks like they will help us in the second-half too.","Gross margin has been negatively impacted in the first quarter. Well, actually really in the first-half, but particularly in the second quarter. In the first quarter, we had the Plum recall and in the half, we have had some project expense work that's fallen into cost of sales, maybe a little bit higher than what we originally anticipated. We have had some weather related costs. The weather has been so severe, we actually had soup freeze in some of our transportation and have to be destroyed and that sort of thing. So we have had some kind of one-off impacts in cost of sales in the first-half.","As I look toward the second-half. I will try this again, I think our gross margin will be pretty similar to what it was last year but clearly, we won't recapture everything that we have lost in the first-half.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","And consumer marketing? Did your budget for that change at all? Are you going to be flat this year? Where are you going to be?","Craig Owens","For the full-year, I would expect us --","Anthony DiSilvestro","We will be a little bit below the sales growth.","Craig Owens","Yes.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Well, so did that change during the course of the year or is that --?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, we had expected it to be a little bit above the rate of sales and now we are forecasting to be a little bit below.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","You are welcome. Thanks, Rob. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Hi, good morning.","Denise Morrison","Good morning, Bryan.","Craig Owens","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","First question, I just wanted to follow-up, I guess on Rob's question. If you kind of back the envelope math, to get the low end of the guidance operating income has to grow by about $90 million in the second-half of the year. Just how much of that is sales dependent? And how much of it is going to be more dependent upon some of the cost phasing and some of the lower cost in the second-half? I am just trying to tease out how much of the profit growth is really just purely sales dependent and how much is going to be year-on-year comps or other programmatic savings?","Craig Owens","Yes.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes.","Craig Owens","Go ahead Anthony.","Anthony DiSilvestro","We looked at this pretty closely and actually only a small part of it derived from the organic sales growth. A big portion is in the G&A line related to the items that Craig just talked about. Also don't forget the 53rd week has a significant impact in the fourth quarter as well.","Craig Owens","Having said that, as Denise said, we do need better sales performance in the second-half than we had in the first-half given the weak first quarter.","Denise Morrison","Right, and we expect organic sales up 2% and 3% from acquisitions.","Craig Owens","And okay, don't forget that you have got a 53rd week and the acquisition contribution in the back-half.","Denise Morrison","Right.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","But that optic of having such a big profit ramp in the back-half, it doesn't look as challenging as it does when you factor in some of the cost comparisons or some of the other factors in the second-half.","Craig Owens","Exactly. When you take it apart, it doesn't have to be driven by really extraordinary sales results or anything.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Okay and then also just a follow-up on Jason's question relative to the distribution changeover at V8. Has that started yet? And do you any expect to see any sort of impact on sales in terms of just maybe pipeline fill and subsequently have you seen any sort of change in inventories may be bled down? Just trying to understand if there is any lumpiness in that, that we should expect going forward?","Denise Morrison","Yes. It is an effect, effective January 1, and we did see wind down in sales to Coke in the second quarter. We will be and are shipping now to the new distribution network. We believe that there will be pipeline fill and increased sales over time. So that's probably the best I can do at this point.","Craig Owens","The ramp-up probably won't be quite as dramatic because it's across a large number of distributors that will be coming on as we move through the quarter.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Okay, and the distributors, are they beverage distributors or are they more general merchandise distributors? Trying to understand who or what the --?","Denise Morrison","They are distributors that cater to the immediate consumption channels, largely convenience stores and single-serve products.","Craig Owens","So it's a multiple-line distributor, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Got it, great. Okay. Thank you very much. Look forward to you guys next week.","Denise Morrison","You are welcome. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with Credit Agricole. Your line is open.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole","Good morning.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Diane.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole","I just wanted to ask, a couple of your peers have talked about spending cuts under the SNAP program and the headwind to sales. I just was wondering if there was any way to quantify what the might mean for Campbell across the features of your portfolio that are attractive to those consumers?","Craig Owens","I think it's very difficult for us to quantify. I would put it into the larger basket of consumer headwind issues that are out there. I think you have seen us and our peers under a lot of pressure to get volume growth. You have seen the grocers under pressure to get volume growth. So I think its part of what's playing in. I think it's really difficult to segregate out that specific impact.","Denise Morrison","Yes. They are dealing with lower employment, higher payroll taxes, healthcare changes, lower discretionary spending available on food. So the food stamp is part of all of that.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole","Okay. I appreciate the color there. Then just a follow-up on the beverage Coke distribution. Was there anything in that contract that prevented you from having products in competing categories? I guess what I am asking is, now that you have a different distribution network, are there categories that would be available for you to expand into that, perhaps before, you weren't allowed in?","Denise Morrison","At this point we are focused on expanding the beverage because that's a huge opportunity for us.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole","I probably think there weren't any contractual limitations?","Anthony DiSilvestro","As we look ahead, the new distribution model does provide us some opportunities to expand beyond the beverage category into some of our other Simple Meals categories as we push it into immediate consumption channels.","Craig Owens","And it also gives us the opportunity to, while the route to market is a little bit different because it's a chilled route to market for Bolthouse and at shelf-stable, even though it's going into refrigerated spaces for V8. It gives us an opportunity to go to distributors and to go to retailers on a joint basis now that we didn't really have under the Coke agreement.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Diane. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Akshay.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about marketing in light of the lower spending that you are expecting now. It's specific to Bolthouse. I know you have spent some money on that brand and I think that was the first initiative behind that brand period. So can you just give us a sense or just an update on Bolthouse and what returns you are sort of seeing from these early investments you made? What does that imply for long-term growth trajectory of that business? Then, if you could just comment on which brands or categories are the ones where you are cutting the marketing? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Denise Morrison","In terms of Bolthouse Farms, recall, this is the first marketing effort that we have had on this brand since it's been newly acquired and the marketing largely met our expectations. We were actually very pleased with the results and we will continue to market that brand in the second-half of this year and invest in it going forward. In terms of the other categories, we have been focusing our marketing largely at competitive levels on our core brands and at ramped up levels on our new products such as the Campbell's cooking sauces and Homestyle and Prego. The only place I can tell you that we will course correct going forward as we believe we did not spend at the appropriate level on condensed eating soup and we will be course correcting that going forward.","Craig Owens","In terms of where the reductions are, I think beverages will be a little lower than our original thinking there as we shift some of that probably to more trade related activity and as we continue to work our way through some of the headwinds that we have seen in beverage and maybe a little bit lighter in Pepperidge but we are not going to be very different from the shape of our original expectation. It was always heavily front-loaded to support the new product introductions and to do the first advertising around Bolthouse and it was always intended to taper back closer to the prior year or slightly below for the balance of the years.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","And just long-term implications of whatever you have learnt from the advertising dollars you spent on Bolthouse? Can you at least share what you learnt from the marketing initiatives that you took on Bolthouse? Thank you. I will pass it on.","Craig Owens","I think it's probably a little early to give the full readout from that but I would fully anticipate that we will continue to be more active in terms of brand building around Bolthouse than they have been historically there. We really think that's one of the opportunities that we have looking forward with the brand.","Denise Morrison","We will take a note to make that part of our review at Analyst Day in July.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Thank you. I will pass it on.","Jennifer Driscoll","The next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. Your line is open.","David Driscoll - Citi Research","Thank you, and good morning.","Craig Owens","Hi, David.","Denise Morrison","Hi, David. Good morning, David.","David Driscoll - Citi Research","I want to go back on soup for just a minute. An important question here. We have done some analysis on the multi-year trends. Third quarter of last year was absolutely a superstar quarter for consumption within our Nielsen data. Your results as well. So Denise, how do you think about this expectation that second quarter consumption underperforms, but yet the requirement is for third quarter to be a strong one, yet it faces singularly the most difficult comparison that you faced in quite a number of years.","Denise Morrison","We acknowledge the fact that we did have a very good third quarter last year but we feel, as we look at our plans in the back-half that they are robust and we are doing some things over the top of what we did last year to have a different outcome. So we have greater promotional frequency. We are launching eight new soups including our first Hispanic cooking soups. We are expanding pub inspired Chunky soups, which are doing really, really well. Some of those are in the top selling SKUs of all soup and we are building more momentum on broth with a bigger Easter program. So we believe that we have robust plans and we are planning on cycling quarter three and quarter four with positive momentum on soup.","David Driscoll - Citi Research","All right. I appreciate the answer. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","You are welcome. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia Howard - Bernstein","Good morning, everyone.","Craig Owens","Hi, Alexia.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Howard - Bernstein","Can I ask about the outlook on the commodity cost side? There seem to be a lot of moving pieces there. On the one hand, the grain envelope is down, which might help the Pepperidge Farm business. On the other hand, we have got droughts in California and meat pressures kicking in as well. As you look out through the second-half of the year, is the commodity outlook pretty benign at this point? Is that one of the reasons why the profit growth should start to accelerate in the second-half? Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. So in the second-half, not much different on the commodity front, on the inflation rate front. We will benefit from not having, as I described earlier, some of the one-off cost that we have had, that if you had cost of sales in the first-half but we are still looking for an inflation rate on inputs and if you just narrow it down to materials, it's more like 1% to 2%, 2.5%. Once you put labor and other overhead cost in it, it gets up to kind of 2% to 3%. Then in the first-half we have been impacted with another point of unusual cost item. So not much impact in the second-half.","As we look forward to next year, you are right. The drought in California is probably going to have an impact on our tomato and our processed tomato cost structure. Obviously you are right about grains, a little bit relief for Pepperidge going forward. But not much impact in the second-half. As you know, we have got a commodity buying program that keeps us out a little bit ahead of the curve and we are pretty well locked in for the balance of this year.","Alexia Howard - Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Good morning. You have owned Plum for three quarters now. What are your learnings on the brand? What I mean is, what do you know now about the consumer that you didn't know before about the new channels that you got into with that brand? Is there any overlap between Plum and Bolthouse because they cater more to millennials, probably that you can exploit?","Denise Morrison","It's still early days of owning Plum. So far, despite the recall situation that we had, we are continuing to see the brand grow in sales. However we have been really focused on getting back in to business on that brand throughout our customer base before we start really expanding distribution and bringing out new products, which will start to happen in the second-half. So it's still early days but we are very pleased with the brand and with the business.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","So no learnings yet that you are willing to share?","Denise Morrison","No, not yet. I mean other than the fact that we studied the category before we made the acquisition and we know it's a higher growth space which is very consistent with our strategy and it also is a very popular brand with millennials.","Craig Owens","It's a negative circumstance to have the recall, but one thing that we have seen is that Plum consumers are very loyal to the brand. I think they really appreciated the way that we have communicated and handled that recall process. They have been very communicative through that process on social media and that sort of things and it has proved to be, despite the negative starting point, to be a pretty good selection of brand loyalty.","Denise Morrison","Yes, they sort of said, through velocities too at the stores where we are fully in-stock. So that's an encouraging thing.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Okay. Thanks.","Jennifer Driscoll","You are welcome. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Jennifer Driscoll","Hi, Matt.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Matthew.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Just two quick ones, since we are in overtime here. One I just wanted to check in on the Goldfish Puffs launch. Just it's been very visible. It's had a lot of display. It seems to be well promoted. So what can you tell us at this point about trial and incrementality to sort of the overall consumption on the brand?","Denise Morrison","Goldfish Puffs has been one of our better introductions and it's largely meeting our expectations. Inclusive of new products, Goldfish was up 5%. So Puffs certainly helped contribute to that sales growth.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Denise Morrison","Then if you link it to slightly older consumer, which we think is more incremental for us.","Jennifer Driscoll","Targeted towards teens and that seems to be a good market for us beyond kids and it's performing very well.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and are you at the point now where you have a view on repeat purchase or still early?","Denise Morrison","Still early.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and then just quickly on the inventory. Just as we are thinking through the mix implications going into next quarter, is that more concentrated in ready-to-serve? Is it broadly across soup? Or are there other categories implicated?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I would say it weighs more to the ready-to-serve category.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Thanks, Anthony.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning.","Craig Owens","Hi, David.","Denise Morrison","Hi, David.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","When you look back at that first-half and you think about the ROI on the innovation spend that you had in the first quarter and advertising in that quarter or the promotion spending in the second quarter, how are you reviewing that as you are thinking about your tactics into the second-half of the year? Will you pursue a similar strategy or perhaps adjusting that somewhat?","Denise Morrison","Obviously, on the advertising, we definitely frontloaded the year. It was up 14% in the first quarter. So that will not be repeated, obviously. We expect a more normal ACT in the back-half.","Anthony DiSilvestro","If you think about innovation, against our dinner sauce, it's hard to think about that over a quarter or even half. We are investing to create a new behavior in a new category in a new shelf space. So we are investing pretty heavily to develop that market and we look at it more on a long-term ROIC basis.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","I am just asking because it seem like you tried, I can appreciate the fact that you have, you are pursuing something more incremental, something more that needs a little bit more explaining in the first quarter advertising spend but it does feel like a lot of companies that have pursued more incremental with the advertising have had disappointing returns on that. So I don't know if that's just in general an indictment on the media spend in general and how you are thinking about that going forward.","Craig Owens","I think it's, again, really difficult. We are still in the trial building phase. Well, on something like dinner sauces, purchase cycle is fairly long. So it does take some time and some investment. So again, I think it's hard to respond to a quarter question.","Anthony DiSilvestro","So we are intentionally investment spending. We know on these new product introductions as you know you are not going to get the return in the quarter on the spending. So I think you have to look at it over a little bit longer period of time and see how the trial and repeat builds.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks.","Jennifer Driscoll","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Your line is open.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays","Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I believe on the last call you had mentioned a possibility to refinance at least part of your August maturities. First, is that still the case? Second, if so, how are you thinking about potentially adding change of control language to the future bond issuances and potentially retroactively adding it in existing bonds? Thank you.","Craig Owens","So it's hard for me to see much advantage to adding it retroactively to bond issuances that are out there. We will consider it going forward, but I feel well, it's just too early to say. Anthony will give that some consideration as we look forward to our future bond issuances.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a quick housekeeping. Where should we expect your debt reduction to be by the end of the year either absolutely or in terms of your leverage?","Craig Owens","Well, I think if you look at the absolute numbers, once you take out the noise created by the European divestiture and the purchases of Kelsen and Plum, it should be sort of a normal operating cash year for us. We tend to fall somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion of operating cash flow on an annual basis.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.","Craig Owens","Thanks.","Jennifer Driscoll","Let's just take one last question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Thanks for the question. Denise, sorry if I missed this, but did you quantify the impact of the Slow Cooker sauces in the quarter?","Denise Morrison","I am sorry, I couldn't quite hear that. Could you repeat that?","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Yes. Did you quantify the impact of the Slow Cooker sauce in this quarter in the sauces business?","Denise Morrison","We didn't, but we may be able to if I talk long enough. While we are looking, I will give you the replay. It's going to be available two hours after the call concludes. You will dial (703)-925-2533 and the passcode is 1630990. We will have that up till February 28, is that long enough, Anthony?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, it is. There sauces contributed about a point of sales growth to the U.S. Simple Meals segment.","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","One point. And then, Denise, can you just walk through how you are seeing those aisle merchandising programs developing at retail with your customers?","Denise Morrison","Are you talking about on the cooking sauces?","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Yes, those you are adding the square footage in the aisles.","Denise Morrison","Recall when we introduced Skillet sauces last year, we had the situation where it was merchandised in about five different places in the grocery store. So we worked diligently this year for our customers to place a section of cooking sauces in the store. It varies where that is located, but typically it is sauce section or even next to broth. But what it does is it gives worthy of space to ourselves and some of our competitors but it gives the consumer a destination to know where to shop for these kinds of products and since we are building a platform, that's been a strategic imperative.","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Okay. So are you seeing a generally favorable buying with that, from the retailer's perspective?","Jennifer Driscoll","I think about half of them.","Denise Morrison","Yes, about half of them. Right, exactly.","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","You are welcome. Thanks everybody for joining us for our second quarter earnings call.

(Broker)","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Campbell Soup third quarter 2015 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Candice, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the third quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. The call is open to the media who participate in listen-only mode.","Today, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide two in our presentation, or to our SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements.","In the third quarter, the company incurred charges associated with our recently announced initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategy, reduces cost and streamlines organizational structure. The company commenced a voluntary separation program and recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $9 million related to the program for severance and benefit related costs. The company also recorded pre-tax charges of $9 million in administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. The aggregate after tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation cost was $11 million or $0.04 per share.","Our comparisons of fiscal 2015 with 2014 will exclude those items impacting comparability. Because we used non-GAAP measures, we've provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.","Before we begin our discussion of the quarter, I'd like to cordially invite our sell-side analysts and institutional investors to our annual investor day at Campbell's World Headquarters. RSVP's are required. Campbell vendors and all others are invited to join by webcast. This year's event will be held the afternoon of Wednesday, July 22. We plan to make it a very informative day for you, featuring presentations by Denise Morrison, Anthony DiSilvestro and our three divisional presidents. We'll include updates on our plans for the company, the three divisions and our cost savings programs, and will also allow plenty of time for interacting with management. So with that, let me turn the call over to Denise Morrison.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter call. A great deal has transpired since we last spoke in February, both at Campbell and in the marketplace. So I believe it's worthwhile to spend time on both topics today. I will share my perspective on the third quarter, and then comment on the broader state of the consumer and events in the food industry since our last earnings call. I'll also provide an update on the progress we made since last quarter in our strategic enterprise redesign, which we discussed in February.","Overall, I am pleased with our results this quarter, especially the improvement in our gross margin. While sales declined in the quarter, this was primarily due to unfavorable currency and the impact of retailer inventory movements on our U.S. soup business. Organic net sales declined by 1%. Importantly, gross margin improved as we took several actions to address the declines in the first half, and adjusted EBIT and EPS were better than expected.","In U.S. Simple Meals, U.S. soup sales were below our expectations, declining 10%. Consumption and market share remained relatively stable. The gap between consumption and sales performance was primarily due to significant unfavorable inventory movements by retailers. Our analysis suggests that this was largely a result of our reduction in trade spending and merchandising, as compared to the prior-year quarter.","Last year, promotions did not generate the anticipated lifts. Therefore, reducing our spending was the right thing to do. In doing so, we expected consumption and shipments to be down, with retailer inventories relatively stable. In fact, consumption was actually better than we expected, but retailer inventory declines exceeded our expectations and are now below prior-year levels. Consequently, sales were below expectations.","Within our soup portfolio, we are encouraged by the performance of our premium offerings. Slow Kettle continues to perform well, and our new Campbell organic soups achieved solid distribution gains. Soups for easy cooking are below expectation. Looking ahead, we will begin shipping Campbell's fresh brewed soup in K-Cups in the fourth quarter.","In our other simple meals business, Prego continued to perform well, led by increases in white sauces and distinctive varieties. Consumption of Campbell dinner sauces remained strong, and we will be adding new grilling sauces to the platform.","Plum sales increased double digits in the quarter, with both share and distribution gains. Plum is now the clear market share leader in organic baby food in the United States.","Our shelf-stable U.S. beverage business performed within our expectations. While this business remains challenged, the early read on V8 Veggie Blends is encouraging. ACV distribution is on plan, and trial is meeting our expectations. Most importantly, depth of repeat is strong.","V8 Protein Bars and Shakes are performing below expectations.","In Global Baking and Snacking, excluding currency, sales rose with solid volume gains in Australia and Indonesia. We feel very good about the progress we've made in Asia-Pacific under the new leadership team in that market.","In the U.S., our Pepperidge Farm business delivered sales gains in fresh bakery, cookies, and crackers. Notably, Goldfish sales increased 5% in the quarter. And marketing increased across our Biscuit and Snacks business. I'm particularly pleased that this segment's operating earnings increased 18%.","Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings grew slightly. In our premium fresh beverage business, we were cycling inefficient promotions from a year ago, which we did not repeat in the quarter. Sales were also negatively impacted by a planned SKU rationalization and the introduction of fewer new items to reduce complexity. Our decision to optimize promotional spending contributed to much stronger operating earnings for the segment.","Looking ahead, our spring innovation is now in the market, including our new cold pressed ultra-premium beverage line, 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, and the initial read has been positive, setting the stage for better sales growth in beverages in the fourth quarter.","Clearly, our gross margin improvement was the main reason for encouragement in the quarter. We achieved net price realization by reducing promotional spending and taking pricing action. So far, consumer response to our pricing actions has been within our expectations.","We benefited from moderating inflation and other factors and delivered an adjusted gross margin increase of 70 basis points, mitigating declines in the first half of the fiscal.","Our adjusted EBIT of $305 million and EPS of $0.62 were ahead of what we expected. We are improving our EBIT and EPS guidance to the favorable end of our range. Anthony will discuss our guidance in more detail in a few minutes.","Turning now to the industry dynamics, this is a tumultuous time in the food industry. We all recognize that the consumer landscape has changed dramatically, driven by a number of seismic shifts. The great recession's impact on consumer purchasing behavior, Global demographic changes, profound shifts in consumer preferences relative to food and the disruptive impact of digital technologies.","All of these are contributing to mounting consumer demand for greater transparency about where and how their food is made. These shifts are converging to create a new normal for the food business. They've produced a persistently challenging environment, with significant volume pressure on mainstream food products, particularly center-store categories.","As a consequence of this new normal, industry participants have initiated a series of strategic actions, including spinoffs, consolidation, acquisitions of small purpose-driven brands, and aggressive cost-cutting measures. The broad adoption of zero based budgeting has set a new bar for cost management in the industry, and the recent consolidation only intensifies the situation, placing even greater focus on cost management.","Campbell is focused on creating shareholder value, by strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces. Areas of emphasis include health and well-being, particularly fresh and organic foods, and Biscuits and Snacks in both developed and developing markets with a focus on Asia and Latin America.","We are increasing our investment in digital marketing, and connecting with consumers in line with our purpose, real food that matters for life's moments. We are doing all of this while instilling an ownership mindset that will help us aggressively manage our costs. We've been paying close attention to the industry dynamics, and strongly believe a strategy that focuses on driving growth, aggressively reducing costs, and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the area of our business with the greatest potential is the best way to create shareholder value over the long term.","With that as context, let me update you on our strategic enterprise redesign. Anthony DiSilvestro will update you on our major cost reduction efforts in a few moments.","We've begun to make changes in the structure of our enterprise to unlock the value of our assets, eliminate barriers to growth, and fulfill our dual mandate to strengthen our core business and to expand into faster-growing spaces. These changes are absolutely essential, and will enable us to fully leverage all we've learned about the key trends in the consumer, customer and business environment. We are working hard to complete the reorganization of our business operations into three principle divisions.","First Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, which we will manage for moderate growth and higher profit. Second, Global Biscuits and Snacks, which will help us, leverage the scale of our combined Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses across developed and developing markets. And finally our Packaged Fresh division where we will make focused investments to accelerate our growth in the Packaged Fresh category.","We've appointed the leadership teams for both Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and the Global Biscuits and Snacks division in the third quarter. Additionally Ed Carolan has been named to the Campbell leadership team for our new Integrated Global Services Group which will include elements of finance, information technology, marketing services, procurement, and human resources.","This group will be a key step in our efforts to reduce costs and elevate operational excellence through shared services and capability-building across the enterprise. We believe our strategic enterprise redesign, inclusive of our cost-reduction efforts, will be game-changing for our company and for our culture. As we pursue our dual mandate, guided by our purpose and growth agenda, this represents the logical next step in our goal of shifting our center of gravity, accelerating our growth trajectory, and maximizing value for our shareholders.","In closing, it has been a very eventful quarter for Campbell. Amidst all the organization changes under way at the company, the team remains focused on driving our performance. It's important to remember that while our industry navigates this volatile landscape, we continue to look at our business and the operating environment with clear eyes, and a clear plan to make the necessary changes at Campbell's to improve our performance. I look forward to sharing more of our strategic plans with you at our investor day on July 22.","Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Anthony for a detailed discussion of our results.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give my perspective on our results, guidance and our cost reduction efforts. Overall, we are pleased with our results for the third quarter. Organic sales were modestly below our expectations, declining slightly, which was primarily the result of movements in retailer inventory levels in the U.S. impacting our U.S. soup business.","Our gross margin percentage increased in the quarter, helping to recover some of the declines we experienced in the first half. Gross margin is benefiting from reductions in trade promotion spending across a number of our businesses, list price increases we've taken in the marketplace, and a moderating level of cost inflation and improved performance relative to the first half in the area of freight and distribution.","With one quarter remaining in the fiscal year, we're narrowing our guidance ranges. While sales are expected to be at the low end of the range, benefits from our cost reduction efforts and a reduction in expected incentive compensation costs are pushing us to the favorable end of the ranges for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS.","As we've discussed, over the next three years, we plan to reduce costs by at least $200 million, or 2% to 3% of annual sales. Leveraging a zero-based approach, we'll streamline our organization's structure to eliminate excess layers, and target expense reductions across a number of cost categories. In connection with our organization efforts in the quarter, for certain U.S. based employees nearing retirement; we offered a voluntary employee separation program under which most of the eligible employees who elected to participate will exit by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, as we begin to implement a zero-based budgeting approach, we are beginning to realize savings in a number of categories. Now, I'll review our results in more detail.","For the third quarter, net sales, on an as-reported basis, declined by 4% to $1.9 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency, organic net sales decreased 1%, as declines in U.S. Simple Meals, driven by the adverse impact of retailer inventory movements on U.S. soup sales, were partly offset by organic sales gains in our Global Baking and Snacking and international segments.","Adjusted EBIT in the quarter fell 2% due to unfavorable currency translation and increased marketing spending on a constant currency basis, partly offset by improved gross margin performance.","Reflecting a lower share count from our strategic share repurchase program, adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 was comparable to the prior year quarter. For the nine month year-to-date period ending April, reported sales were comparable to the prior year, with organic sales gaining 1%, led by our performance in Global Baking and Snacking. Adjusted EBIT declined 4%, as the negative impact of a lower gross margin percentage and currency translation were partly offset by volume gains and lower marketing and administrative expenses. EPS of $2.02 is down 1%.","Decomposing our sales performance, organic sales declined by 1%, while currency translation reduced sales by 3 points. Our two primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both weakened against the U.S. dollar. Within organic sales, volume mix contributed 3 points to the sales decline. The decline was primarily related to our U.S. Simple Meals segment.","Higher selling prices, primarily in U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking, added 1 point of growth. Reduced promotional spending across our four largest segments contributed 1 point to sales growth. The most significant reductions were in U.S. soup, Pepperidge Farm, and Bolthouse Farms, and reflects our efforts to improve price realization across the portfolio.","As you'll see on the next chart, these price realization efforts, both on list price and trade promotions, are contributing to improved gross margin performance in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 70 basis points, compared to the prior year. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 2.4 points. For the quarter, cost inflation, as a rate, increased by approximately 2%. In addition, costs of products sold reflects the adverse impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses. And while we have made progress in our performance throughout the quarter, particularly in the area of freight and distribution, supply chain costs are above the prior year. Due primarily to the sales decline in U.S. soup, we experienced 30 basis points of negative mix.","In aggregate our price realization actions have contributed 1.6 points of margin expansion, with 70 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily in U.S. Simple Meals and Baking and Snacking, and 90 basis points from lower promotional spending across four of our five reporting segments.","Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 180 basis points of margin improvement. Marketing and selling expenses decreased 2% in the quarter, due to the impact of currency and lower marketing overhead expenses, partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expenses, which increased by 8%. Increased levels of advertising in Global Baking and Snacking were partly offset by reductions in U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages.","Adjusted administrative expenses were down 1%, as spending reductions and the impact of currency were mostly offset by higher incentive compensation costs compared to the year-ago quarter. Across both of these expense lines, we are achieving benefits from our cost management efforts, including our $200 million cost reduction initiatives.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS changes between our operating performance and below the line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS was comparable to the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed a penny of EPS growth. Net interest expense declined $2 million versus a year ago, as we reduced our debt level. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.3%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year adjusted rate. With rounding, neither interest expense nor taxes had an EPS impact for the quarter.","Under our strategic share repurchase program, we have repurchased 150 million year to date, and this has added one penny to EPS in the quarter. Currency had a $0.02 negative impact on EPS in the quarter. We continue to estimate that currency will have a two-point or $0.05 per share negative impact for the full year.","Now turning to our segment results. In U.S. Simple Meals, sales declined 6%, driven by 10% decline in U.S. soup sales. While dollar consumption of soup in measured channels declined by just 1%, movements in retailer inventory levels, compared to the prior year, drove most of the sales decline in the quarter. The decline in soup sales reflects lower volumes, partly offset by a reduction in promotional spending and higher selling prices. Sales in other simple meals increased 2%, driven by Prego pasta sauce and Plum Organics. Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals declined 16%, reflecting a lower sales and a lower gross margin percentage, partly offset by lower marketing.","The lower gross margin percentage includes cost inflation, which was above the company average, and the impact of unfavorable product mix.","Global Baking and Snacking had a strong quarter, as 5% organic sales growth was driven by the performance in Arnott's biscuits, with volume gains in Australia and Indonesia. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by growth in Goldfish crackers and fresh bakery, partly offset by declines in sales of Pepperidge Farm frozen products.","Kelsen also grew sales in the quarter.","Operating earnings increased 18%, driven by gains in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's, reflecting improved gross margin performance and sales growth.","In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment organic sales decreased 1%, with sales declines in Bolthouse carrot and natural ingredients, partly offset by growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressing and North America Foodservice.","Operating earnings increased 35% on lower promotional spending in Bolthouse Farms Beverages and productivity improvements. U.S. beverage sales fell 2%. Benefiting from lower marketing spending, operating earnings increased by 17%.","International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales improved 6% on gains in both the Asia-Pacific region and in Canada. Operating earnings were comparable to the prior year, as the benefit of higher organic sales was offset by the negative impact of currency translation.","For U.S. soup, sales declined by 10% in the quarter with condensed down 4%, RTS down 18%, and broth declining 13%. Movements in retailer inventory levels which we believe were driven by the reduction in year-over-year promotional spending was the primary driver of the sales decline. As I mentioned, consumer take-away in measured channels for the comparable 13-week period ending May 3 declined 1% in dollars.","Year to date, as shown at the bottom of the chart, Soup sales declined 3% versus the prior year, as a 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve was partly offset by 2% growth in broth. Consumer take away in measured channels for the comparable 39-week period ending May 3 also declined 1% in dollars. We ended the quarter with retailer inventory positions below prior-year levels.","Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending May 3, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.1%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.4% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups, notably Homestyle, partly offset by gains in broth.","Our share declined just 20 basis points in the last 52 weeks, and has been relatively stable for three years. Other branded players in aggregate had a share of 28%, also declining 20 basis points, while private label with a 13% share gained 40 basis points, reflecting recent gains in broth.","We had strong cash flow performance in the first nine months. Cash from operations increased by $208 million to $971 million, due to lower working capital requirements, wrapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business, and lower pension contributions. We continue to forecast that cash from operations for the full year will reach $1.1 billion.","Capital expenditures increased to $242 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of about $400 million for the year as we increase capacity to support growth in our faster-growing businesses. We paid dividends totaling $297 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share.","In aggregate we repurchased $192 million of shares in the first nine months, $150 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by approximately $130 million to $3.6 billion.","Now I'll review our 2015 guidance. As a reminder, this guidance is based off a 52-week adjusted 2014 as shown on the chart. Our guidance ranges also include an estimated negative impact of currency translation of two points across sales, EBIT, and EPS.","As we announced earlier this morning, given we just have one quarter remaining, we are narrowing our fiscal 2015 guidance. For sales, we expect to be closer to the low end of our minus 1% to plus 1% range. For both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, we now expect to be at the favorable end of the previously announced ranges of minus 7% to minus 5% for adjusted EBIT, and minus 5% to minus 3% for adjusted EPS.","The outlook in both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS reflects our cost management efforts, including benefits from our previously announced $200 million cost reduction initiative as well as a reduction in expected incentive compensation costs.","At the end of the second quarter, we said that incentive compensation represented a $0.06 per share headwind for 2013. Based on our current outlook we are now forecasting that this impact will be approximately $0.04 per share, most of which will impact our fourth quarter performance.","For the full year, we continue to forecast that our gross margin percentage will decline by approximately 1 point. The tax rate will be in the range of 30% to 31%, and interest expense will be slightly below the prior year. That concludes my remarks and now I'll turn it back to Jennifer for Q and A.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks Anthony and Denise. We'll start our Q&A session. Since we have a limited time, out of fairness to other callers please ask only one question at a time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thank you. I had a question about...","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. I had a question about the promotional spending cuts. Do you think that that could extend into fiscal 2016 as well? How much additional discipline do you expect to use in the soup franchise and others?","And then just a quick one on Global Snacking. Denise, you have talked about Global Snacking for a while. But Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm, they are different brand names, the packaging is different, there's not a lot of crossover \u2013 that I see anyway in terms of products that are similar. Is there additional kinds of synergies that you could see between the regions that they haven't been capturing yet? Thanks.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Let me take the first one on the trade spending. I want to go back in particularly to U.S. soup. And I'm going to go back to the year 2013, where we actually increased our \u2013 we were actually operating our trade at a certain rate, and we had a 14% lift in sales.","In 2014, we increased that by about 3%, and our sales were flat. So our analytics suggested that that was not a good spend, and there were many unproductive promotions out there that weren't doing the retailer any good, or us any good. So we course-corrected that in 2015 in the quarter, and went back to the same rate we were spending in 2013.","We are still within the ACT of 25%, which is our goal, and that strategy really hasn't changed. But that said, we continue to be much more disciplined in our analytics on every dollar we're spending out there and the return we're getting for that and that will continue into the future.","On Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm, they definitely are different. We have been expanding the Arnott's brand beyond Australia, into Southeast Asia, and particularly Indonesia, and also in Asia, in Hong Kong. Pepperidge Farm's been expanding more into Canada, and where we are seeing the synergies is in R&D. There's a lot of sharing going on in that area, but by putting the Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen brands together in one division, we expect that part of that will be a global brands team that will start to look at, now that we have platforms in these countries, how can we expand with the brands that we have to take advantage of that scale? So more to come on that, but that's the plan.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Rob, I'll just add to Denise's comment on the first part. We're not going to comment too specifically on 2016 but we are very focused on improving our gross margin over time and we recognize part of that program has to come from net price realization, and to me, there are three areas we'll be looking at. One is, we'll continue to look for opportunities to improve our list price realization. We'll continue to drive our analytics to improve the efficiency of our trade spend, whether that's removing unprofitable deals or improving the profitability of others. And we'll also look for strategic opportunities to move up our promoted price points over time. So, those three things collectively will contribute to price realization, which will hopefully contribute to gross margin expansion.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hello, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, I realize you \u2013 with respect to gross margin I guess you kept the gross margin guidance for the full year the same as previously, even though the fiscal 3Q gross margin came in what seems like better than you and many investors had expected. So, I'm just trying to get a sense of \u2013 is there something that you see in the fourth quarter, albeit it's a seasonally small quarter, that would suggest gross margin steps back a bit or something doesn't come through quite as significantly? Or is it just \u2013 it's a small quarter and see how it plays out?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Andrew, I would say, relative to our own expectations, gross margin was only slightly better than we expected in the third quarter, and that's kind of flown through to the change in guidance. At the end of the second quarter, we did anticipate and did expect to improve gross margin percentage in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So, we do continue to anticipate a modest improvement in gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter as well, to get back to that, close to that minus 1 point forecast that we gave you guys.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And Anthony, are inventories at a point where they're sort of artificially low, such that shipments outpace consumption going forward into next fiscal year? Or are we just at a new ongoing level of inventory that now maintains from here?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's a really challenging question to answer. Obviously, we don't control the level of retailer inventory levels. We do see that they're down relative to last year. And I would say, if they follow their typical pattern and get close to where they were at the end of the fourth quarter last year that would imply some tailwind for us on soup sales in the fourth quarter. But, again, that one is really hard for us to project.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Chris.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I just have a question for you, a bit of a follow-on to Rob's question if I could, which is (36:05) keeping total spending (36:12)","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah, Chris? I'm sorry. Chris, you're really cutting out. Do you have a hand set you could use?","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'm on a hand set, so maybe I'll requeue. Is this any better?","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","It still sounds \u2013 you're in and out. Could you call back in and we'll put you back in, maybe after the next one?","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Sure. Thank you.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, can you make sure that happens?","Operator","Yes. Thank you. And our next question will come from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hello, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. I'll apologize in advance to Chris if I front run his question; that wasn't my intention.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","But I wanted to ask about promotion too. I guess, Anthony and Denise, I appreciate some of the progress you made during the quarter on gross margin. But it also feels like we have gone from one extreme to the other extreme, with gross margins stronger on lower promotion and higher pricing, but also unwinding a lot of the progress that it felt like you were making on volumes and inciting some inventory reduction by retailers. So I guess, I think you touched on elasticity being roughly in line. But is this really the type of volume response you expected to these promotional changes? And if so, do you feel that this is the right balance going forward?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Matt, I think that what we've been paying very close attention to is consumption and market share. And to give you some idea of that, our consumption was down 1% for the quarter. Condensed was down 1%. RTS was down 2%. RTS Premium was up 28%. Slow Kettle was up 50%. And so, we're continuing to see stability in the category, and in our performance in the category. So that's what we've been paying attention to, as opposed to excess inventory driven by promotion spending, or the latter effect.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So there's nothing in the reaction to the promotional changes here in Q3 that you feel a need to change \u2013 tweak strategy in the short term?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I'd say, on Soup, that the consumption has actually held up a little bit better than we had anticipated, given the reduction in trade promotion.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And can I ask just a quick follow-up on inventories? Clearly a big part of that was a reaction to the changes in promotional support, but there has also been some press reports pointing to individual retailers actively shifting the balance of merchandising activity away from some of the of store categories. So, just curious whether you think some of what we saw here in Q3 was more sort of broad programmatic changes at major retailers, as opposed to a specific reaction to your behavior?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we think it's more about what happened last year, and what happened in the third quarter last year. We increased quite significantly the amount of trade promotion in U.S. soup. And, quite frankly, it did not result in the lifts we had expected, and it resulted, therefore, in higher inventory levels at retail. And all we're doing is kind of wrapping that. So this is more about what happened last year than what's happening this year.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And this year, we actually gained four feet of shelf space for premium soup.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks, both.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Have we got Chris back?","Operator","And we do have Chris Growe. Your line is now open.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, how does this sound?","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Much better. Thank you.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I wish I could say was calling from a beach somewhere, but I am unfortunately in my office here. I just had a quick question; it was a bit of a follow-on to Rob's question earlier, and forgive me if you answered this. I may have missed it. As you have reduced promotional spending but kept your overall marketing and promotional spending, that pressure on the consumer, it would imply that more money is going behind advertising. Is that right? Or should that overall kind of 25% of sales start to come down as you get more efficient with your trade spending?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The 25% ACT is about the average in CPG. So we keep that as a guardrail. But the divisions will work with all the drivers of demand to figure the right mix for the brands that they are responsible for.","In this quarter, we actually did have an increase in advertising by about 8%. With 11% in constant currency dollars. But that mostly went toward the Biscuit and Snacks business in both the United States and in Australia. There was a reduction in advertising and consumer in the Simple Meals business.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Does that advertising increase then more than make up for the decline in trade spending?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. Total marketing, advertising, consumer and trade is down a bit in aggregate, compared to last year.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. If I could just ask one other follow-up as well, just in relation to the new product contribution, I know you are focused more on fewer, bigger, better, if we can use that term. I am just curious. You had a lot of new product activity this year in 2015. Has that been contributing strongly to revenue growth for the year? Is there any metrics you can look at, like how much your revenue has come from new products this year?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know if you got that figure.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't have that figure in front of me.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't either. I think that I can address the fewer-bigger, though, because we have still had a disproportionate amount of line extensions that \u2013 things like soup for easy cooking that just haven't contributed meaningfully. And it's created some complexity in our supply chain. So what we've been doing is really focusing on a fewer, bigger platforms like the dinner sauces, like the organic food, like the Slow Kettle, that we can build and will have a meaningful contribution. We're going to try some things that aren't going to work. The trick is to catch them early and move on.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A question about U.S. Beverages. In this quarter, sales were only down modestly I guess year-over-year, and you had pretty good profit contribution. I understand I guess part of that is just the marketing expense was lower. But are we closer to the point now where you feel like you've got that business stabilized? Or is that just too much of a read into this quarter?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, I call them green shoots. Not waving the victory flag yet. But we are again seeing really positive signs from the new V8 Veggie Blends, and the impact that's having on our vegetable juice. Our Splash business is strong. Our single-serve business did pretty well in the quarter. Where we've been hit is the V8 V-Fusion, and we're just dealing with that one.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And then just one follow-up, and maybe I'm not following this correctly. But it sounds like retailers didn't buy as much soup as you thought they would have; yet the takeaway was a little bit better even in response to the promotional level. So did retailers not buy enough soup? Like would you have sold more soup if retailers had bought more? Or is that not the right way to read it?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I wouldn't read it that way. I think your first part of your question was right, is that the consumption has held up better than we expected, but the change in retailer inventory levels was more than we expected.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. Have a great holiday.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You too.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks. You too.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Eric.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everybody. I have maybe a little bit of a longer-term question, then a short-term question. Why don't we deal with the latter first, the short-term? Anthony, the corporate expense line was a lot lower than we had expected. Is that a function entirely of the incentive comp, or is there other stuff going on there?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","When you say the corporate line, unallocated corporate?","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, exactly, within the segments.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think what we're seeing is a relatively big benefit from our cost management efforts, so earlier in the year, we had put some restrictions on hiring. We had put some restrictions on discretionary spending, and then later in the year we started our $200 million cost reduction initiative and we're seeing some early benefit from that, but I think you put those two things together and we're doing a bit better on the cost management side. A lot of that's coming through the G&A line. Some of it's coming through marketing overhead and we're just seeing a little bit, doing a little bit better on the cost side than we had originally anticipated.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, Denise, I guess the longer-term question is, at CAGNY you told us that in simple meals you are going to more of a relative top-line approach. And in listening to your explanations today and certainly over the last couple of years, there has been new product efforts and promotion, and sometimes it's worked and sometimes it hasn't, and that's kind of swung things around both from a sales to gross margin to profit standpoint.","And so as you implement kind of more of the simple meals or relative top-line approach and combine with ZBB, I mean, do you basically anticipate that division sales kind of being flat to down and profit up as promotion is just less volatile and arguably less of a negative? Maybe you can give us some initial thoughts there, and I'll pass it off. Thanks.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think it is fair to say that the \u2013 a couple years ago, the simple meals business was in a hole, and we've gotten to the point where we've gotten stability in consumption and market share over the past two years. Now we've got to get to profitable growth. That said, that's going to be moderate, based on where that category is, and where it plays today. We do anticipate margin expansion in that division as well, so that's the portfolio role that Americas Simple Meals and Beverages will play.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks. Have a good weekend.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You too.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks; good morning.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, John.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Denise, just wanted to come back to the beverages side for a minute. You have been out some time now with the independent distributor model for the instant consumables. Just wondering how that is evolving for you in terms of distributor performance, opportunities to rationalize or consolidate some distributors; and just what you are seeing in terms of the returns there overall.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Are you talking about the immediate consumption business?","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Yeah, we \u2013 when we moved away from the Coke distribution system, we created a network of distributors that could cover the United States that was largely DSD. Some of that worked, and some of it didn't. We course-corrected, and added some broadline distributors to that network, and that's working much better today.","In addition, we had our Foodservice sales force responsible for managing those distributors. We have since moved the sales effort to our retail sales force, to not only motivate the distributors from a supply standpoint but also to have end-user customer coverage to create demand, and we've also supplemented that with some broker support for store work.","So we believe with this more push-pull model, we set ourselves up for better results. Finally, we are introducing more products in the range that distributors have to work with. In the past, they had V8 Red Juice. They had a couple SKUs of Splash and a little bit of V8 V-Fusion. Today they have that plus the V8 Veggie Blends in single-serve, V8 energy and we have a pipeline of new products as well, so we're very committed to immediate consumption. It's only 10% of our business today and we know in a lot of beverage companies it's 50%, and very profitable. So this is worth building and being patient and doing it the right way?","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Denise.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Akshay.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Akshay.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. My question is on your recent acquisitions, Bolthouse and Plum Organics. If you just take a step back and \u2013 I would love to get an update on where those businesses are relative to when you bought them, and what your expectations were. On Plum Organics, Kroger at a recent conference was raving about it. I know it is relatively small as a percentage of your overall sales, but seems like that one after some initial issues has really taken off. So if you could give us an update on both of those, greatly appreciate it. Thank you.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I think overall we're very pleased with our acquisitions of Bolthouse Farms and Plum Organics. We bought both of them to drive growth, and they are delivering the growth. Bolthouse Farms gets us into the Packaged Fresh category, where we can continue to build and bring new capabilities to that space. They have a great team, and Plum Organics, also a great team, is a window to millennial parents, and has taught us a lot about organic food, and really different ways of connecting with the next generation of consumers. So from a strategic standpoint and a performance standpoint, we're very pleased with both of these acquisitions.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, if I can just add to that to give a slightly, the other side, is we've seen a little bit of margin pressure in some of these businesses, and are taking actions as you can see. In Bolthouse Farms there's been a little more trade pressure and this quarter we did dial back on trade to improve the profitability, so it's been a little bit of pressure on the margin there.","And in Plum, we're going through a more extensive integration of some of the back and front-office operations to improve the profitability of that business going forward, as well.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Alexia.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Okay, just one quick data question and then another one. You mentioned that the shelf space allocated to premium products had gone up by about 4 feet. I'm assuming that's some sort of weighted average distribution metric? Is some of the inventory reduction a reduction in shelf space on your more mainstream brands? And if so, how much is that reduction? And then just on the promotions, there have been a lot of discussions on this call. Do you have view as to why the promotional spending has become less effective over the last few quarters or so? Thank you very much, and I'll pass it on.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. We have not had reports of reduction of shelf space on our mainstream brands. We really believe that the inventory movements that we've talked about were movements in warehouse inventory due to buying less cases because of a reduction in promotion spending.","And then, on the second part of the question. One of the things we experienced in the quarter was, we were cycling the relaunch of Campbell's Homestyle RTS, where we had a huge ACT spend against that brand, and obviously we did not repeat those levels of spending this time around.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think it's important on the promotional spending, if you step back, in aggregate, we spend somewhere around $1.5 billion on trade promotion in a year. Overall, we feel that it's an effective spend and that we're getting a return. When we talk about the changes, we're talking about this $50 million reduction. Again, it's $1.5 billion. So, we're at the edges of it and we continued to try to improve the effectiveness of that spend. We drive our analytics to look for opportunities to reduce unprofitable trade deals. We look for opportunities to increase the effectiveness of trade deals. We look for opportunities to increase the promoted prices over time. So I think we're talking about relatively minor refinements to the overall bigger program.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, year-to-date, our trade spend is down a point.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Jason.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning. Hi, guys. Thank you for letting me to ask a question. I wanted to follow up on Alexia's question, because your answer surprised me. You said you haven't lost shelf space on your legacy products, but you have gained 4 feet on premium soups. Have you really gained 4 feet on average of shelf space for soup at retail?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's what our figures show us. I mean, we track this very, very closely, and that's the feedback.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","What we are seeing in terms of retail data is pretty sharp velocity declines on a sales per TDP or gross distribution point metric, sort of high single digit, low double digit. How sticky do you think that shelf space is?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not sure what data you're looking at.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Nielsen data. Okay, I guess I could follow up with Jennifer on that just to get sort of clarity on the data. Why don't I move on to one more then? It is back sort of building on Akshay's question about M&A, and it is more about the portfolio overall. Over the last of years, Denise, you've embarked on a bit of a portfolio reconfiguration effort with some of the M&A. Are you happy with where the portfolio is today? Do you think it is the portfolio that will allow you to get back to your long-term algorithms? Or should we expect M&A to remain in the forefront of your strategy as you continue to rebalance the portfolio? And if so, can you give us an update in terms of what you are thinking in terms of fit, size, timing, et cetera?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think we've made good progress, in terms of the reshaping of our portfolio and pushing into faster-growing spaces with the three acquisitions that we made, and with the divestiture of the Europe Simple Meals business. I do believe that we need more M&A. Although, we're very willing to be patient because deals need to create shareholder value. And so, we're very disciplined in our approach there.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","We'll take one more question. We're coming up on the hour.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just one more comment on the shelf space and stickiness question. As Denise mentioned most of that gain has to do with extension of our premium offering, and our Slow Kettle business is growing well above double digits in the marketplace. So, we feel really good about the velocities we're seeing on that business.","And, as you know, we've just launched a line of organic soups into that premium section, as well. It's still early days on the organic thing, but we feel really good about the ACV distribution and shelving we've achieved to date on that one. So, we feel really good about our premium offering in Soup, on shelf.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from David Driscoll of Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. Just a few loose ends. Anthony, can you quantify how much of the $200 million in cost savings are to be realized this year? And then also for you, can you quantify for us what you expect the incentive compensation headwind to be for F16?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so let me take those one at a time. I can't quantify specifically on the $200 million. It gets a bit complex. But what I can tell you, that between the cost retainment efforts that we had in place before the $200 million initiative, and inclusive of the $200 million initiative, we've probably saved somewhere around $15 million in the quarter.","Now, when we get to Analyst Day, we'll try to parse that apart, because we're still going through the analysis now to figure out, well, how much is due to the change in travel policy, for example, or consultant policy, relative to the restrictions we had in place already on discretionary spending and head count? So it gets a bit difficult to do that. And we'll try to do that for you when we get to Analyst Day, and we'll try to give you an outlook, looking ahead across the three years, at what rate do we expect to realize the $200 million?","On the incentive comp, just to give you kind of order of magnitude. If I take you all the way back to the beginning of the year, we said that incentive compensation would be a $0.09 headwind. Now we're saying it's a $0.04 headwind. That nickel is still hanging out there for next year. Probably a way to think about it.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Then just following up on the fourth-quarter expectations, what drives EPS down so much, given your expectation for gross margin improvement and what sounds like pretty clearly additional cost savings?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, let me give you a couple of components I think should help you. The one thing to remember is that last year has the extra week, right? So if you go back to the $0.49 that we reported on an adjusted basis, there's $0.08 in there that we've quantified as the extra week. The other thing we've said is that $0.04 compensation headwind all sits in the fourth quarter, and there's probably another $0.01 of currency. So there's $0.13 of decline for you year-on-year.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I appreciate the help. Thanks to everyone and have a great holiday weekend.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","You too.","Jennifer K.

Please go ahead.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015.","With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, our Chief Financial Officer; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations.","We will start with a few housekeeping items. Then, Denise, will offer her perspective on the quarter and progress with our F'15 objectives. Anthony will discuss our financial results for the quarter before elaborating on our expectations for fiscal 2015. After that, we will take your questions.","As usual, we have created slides that accompany our presentation.

Because we use non-GAAP measures we provided in our appendix, a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.","With that, let me turn the call over to Denise Morrison.","Denise Morrison","Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Today, I am going to share my perspective on our first quarter 2015 performance. I will review the key drivers of our results, including our positive organic sales performance across most of our core and acquired businesses. Then I will discuss the challenges we are facing and the actions we are taking.","Our challenges include our gross margin performance and the impact of currency headwinds, which Anthony will review in greater detail in his presentation.","As a reminder, we said on September 8th, that we don't expect our growth in fiscal 2015 to be evenly distributed across quarters. As a result, we believe that evaluating our business performance on a first-half basis, rather than a quarterly basis, will be more meaningful.","Let us start by examining the key growth drivers in our core business in the quarter. I was pleased that we drove top and bottom-line growth in U.S. Simple Meals, with higher sales in our U.S. soup portfolio. Our U.S. soup performance benefitted from a stronger seasonal sell-in and the timing of our quarter end relative to the Thanksgiving holiday.","As we stated, one of our strategic priorities is to expand our presence in the faster growing premium soup, which represents roughly 10% of the wet soup category. We made good progress as we launched new Slow Kettle varieties in the quarter to drive the brand's double-digit sales growth.","Many of our retail customers have created a dedicated shelf space for our premium soups, where we have gained additional linear fee.","The next step in our plan is to expand further with the launch of six varieties of Campbell's organic soup in easier to open cartons this January. Another key driver in U.S. Simple Meals was our strong performance in sauces, including Prego, Pace and Campbell's dinner sauces as we introduce new products and leverage merchandising.","We expanded our dinner sauces platform beyond Skillet and Slow Cooker pouches, with the launch of Oven Sauces in the quarter, which has quickly achieved 52% ACV.","Overall, Campbell dinner sauces now have over 80% ACV, with dedicated sections that are becoming a consumer destination. Within Global Baking and Snacking, a significant improvement in our core business was our performance in Australian biscuits.","We are moving in the right direction to stabilize the business in Australia, where we drove our net sales and earnings. Our tame [ph] growth consumption and share in total biscuits by strengthening planning and execution with our retail partners increasing marketing and promotion behind core brands and driving innovation, including new Tim Tam varieties in light and crispy Arnott\u2019s Shapes.","I was also pleased with the continued strong growth in our Indonesia business, which expanded beyond sweet biscuits into savory crackers, with the introduction of Arnott\u2019s Shapes.","Now, let's look at the performance of the trio of growth engines that we acquired in the last two years, Bolthouse Farms, Plum Organics and Kelsen. Strategically, we acquired these businesses to expand in the faster growing spaces and respond to the seismic shifts in the consumer landscape, including the focus on health and well-being and the growth of the middle class in developing markets.","Together, these businesses contributed one point of organic sales growth to our company in the quarter.","We were encouraged by Bolthouse Farms' strong top-line growth. We continue to expand distribution in packaged fresh super premium beverages and fresh salad dressings.","Bolthouse Farms has strengthened its number one share position in premium beverages over the last year, while simplifying and streamlining its beverage portfolio, increasing space for higher velocity offerings and reducing out of stocks.","During the quarter, we also launched Bolthouse Farms Kids, the brands first line of healthy beverages and Veggie Snackers for children. We are merchandising Bolthouse Farms Kids with a dedicated shelf set in the fresh produce section to further expand our position in the fast-growing perimeter. Our goal is to become a branded leader in the $18.6 billion packaged fresh category.","Plum Organics delivered double-digit sales growth after facing challenges a year ago, as the number one brand in the organic segment of the U.S. baby food market Plum continue to expand distribution and drive innovation in simple meals and snacks.","We are continuing to integrate Plum to leverage Campbell's Kettle and amp up its expansion while maintaining its entrepreneurial spirit.","Kelsen, which we acquired early in last year's first quarter to expand our global snacks business, delivered higher sales as it continued to meet our expectations. We are focused on expanding distribution in key cities in China.","The second quarter historically marks the peak season for Kelsen sales and earnings as an authentic Danish butter cookies are often exchanged by friends and families in China and gifts for holidays and festive occasions, including Chinese New Year's.","Now, let us take a look at some of our challenges and how we are addressing them. I am going to focus my remarks on two businesses that underperformed Pepperidge Farm and U.S. Beverages, but before I get to those, ","Let me say that our gross margin performance in the quarter did not meet our expectations. Some of the pressure came from higher than anticipated commodity inflation and some came from unexpected costs in our supply chain, including manufacturing and transportation costs. ","Anthony will describe these issues in greater detail in a few moments. We are taking action to manage costs aggressively and working all the levers to mitigate the unexpected pressure on gross margin.","Turning to the businesses, Pepperidge Farms' performance in the quarter was mixed. I was pleased with our growth in cookies driven by Milano and crispy Pepperidge Farm varieties. We also drove strong results in fresh bakery, which continue to outperform the market with consumption and share gains. Fresh bakery benefited from our focus on seasonal offerings and quality improvements.","Our main challenge in this business is to restore growth in crackers. It is important to examine the total cracker category. For the past two years, dollar consumption growth trends have slowed in the category and were flat to declining in the quarter. We see several crucial drivers in this category deceleration.","First, we are seeing a shift in consumer snacking preferences. About of half of cracker consumers are buying crackers and other snacks less frequently. When they do, they are shifting in some cases to snacks that are better for you or in the opposite end of the spectrum, more indulgent snacks.","Second, approximately three quarters of the losses in the total category has been in sandwich crackers, where we don't compete.","Third, total advertising in the category has declined more than 20% in the last year, impacting velocities as price and distribution held.","Finally, there has been a decline in the number of new products introduced in the category, resulting in less excitement from innovation in the cracker isle.","In this environment, some major brands have continued to outpace the category. One of those brands is Goldfish, which has consistently outperformed the category over the last three years. In the first quarter, despite growing consumption and share and outperforming the category Goldfish sales declined, due in part to cycling the distribution build of the launch of Goldfish Puffs. We are not satisfied with this performance given the brand's steady track record of growth over many years.","We continue to expect Goldfish sales to be up for the year behind strong holiday programs, increased advertising and consumer promotion and improved in-store merchandising.","Going forward, we are increasing advertising by about 20% with a quarter of our spend in digital media. Our plans include increased innovation, including new flavors of Goldfish and Goldfish Puffs.","Turning now to U.S. Beverages, although we grew operating earnings, sales in V8 V-Fusion and V8 vegetable juice declined as shelf stable category remained under pressure. Our plans to revitalize our V8 platform are underway.","The next step is the January launch of V8 veggie blends. We are optimistic about this launch as we plan to tap into the juicing trends by offering nutritious affordable juicing that is convenient for the consumer.","Separately, in the quarter, we extended the V8 brand to a new category, with the launch of V8 protein shakes and bars to expand into adult on-the-go nutrition, a multibillion-dollar category. This is another example of our focus on driving breakthrough innovation to expand in the faster growing spaces.","Looking ahead, although we face more challenging comparisons, we are confident about our plans for the year which include driving continued growth in U.S. Simple Meals, continuing our turnaround in Australian biscuits, which moved in the right direction in the first quarter, restoring growth in Goldfish crackers and improving Pepperidge Farms' top-line performance, revitalizing V8 to bring news to the shelf-stable juice category and delivering strong performance in Bolthouse Farms, Plum Organics and Kelsen.","Across our portfolio, we are responding to the consumer shift to health and well-being with new, on-trend products, ranging from Campbell's organic soups and V8 veggie blends in the center of the store to Bolthouse Farms Kids in the fresh parameter and V8 protein shakes and bars in health and beauty aisle. Finally, we are taking action to mitigate gross margin pressure in the remainder of the year.","To sum up, we delivered organic sales growth across most our core and acquired businesses in the first quarter, with stronger performance is in U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking.","We have more work ahead and challenges to overcome this year, but we remain focused on our strategy to strengthen our core business and expand in the faster growing spaces to reshape our portfolio for a more profitable growth trajectory.","I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes.","Now, let me turn the call over to Anthony for a detailed review of our financial performance.","A - Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning. Thanks, Denise. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give some perspective on our result and guidance. As Denise said, we are encouraged with our top-line performance as we start the fiscal year. However, this top-line performance is dampened by gross margin pressure from higher than anticipated cost inflation and supply chain related costs.","The other item I want to call out is currency. Due to the recent and significant strength of the U.S. dollar against most major foreign currencies, we are seeing a negative impact that we did not forecast. Based on this headwind and volatility from currency translation, we have reduced the low end of our guidance ranges. Importantly, our currency neutral expectations have not changed.","Now, I will review our results. First quarter net sales increased 4% to $2,255 million organic net sales increased by 5%, with volume and organic sales gains in four of our five reportable segments.","Sales in the quarter benefited from movements in retailer inventory levels from a stronger seasonal sell-in and the later timing of our quarter relative to the Thanksgiving holiday.","In aggregate, the movements in retailer inventory represent about half of our organic sales gains in the quarter. We are encouraged by the sales performance in Australia and from the performance of our recent acquisitions Bolthouse Farms, Plum and Kelsen contributed one point of total company organic growth in the quarter.","Adjusted EBIT increased 9%, reflecting the higher sales, the benefit of lapping the prior year Plum recall and lower administrative and marketing expenses, which are partly offset by the decline in our gross margin percentage. Adjusted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.74.","Decomposing our sales performance, favorable volume mix was the main driver of the increase, primarily in the U.S. Simple Meal and Global Banking and Snacking segment.","Overall, increased promotional spending was negatively impacted to sales by one point. While our promotional rate was stable in our largest segment, U.S. Simple Meals, the increase was driven by higher rate of spending in the Global Banking and Snacking segment.","Currency also negatively impacted sales by one point as our two primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both weakened against the U.S. dollar.","We are disappointed with our gross margin performance, which did not meet our expectations. The bridge on this chart highlights the factors impacting our performance.","First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 340 basis points. Most of this was cost inflation, which as a rate increased by almost 4%. Recent and unanticipated increases in dairy, beef and aluminum have added to the overall inflation impact. Also, with pressure on carrier capacity, we are seeing much higher freight cost.","For the full fiscal year, we now anticipate cost inflation at the high-end of our 3% to 4% range. In our North American supply chain, we experienced higher than expected manufacturing and freight costs from significant volume demand early in the quarter. As a result, we ran production more weekend, increased the use of co-packers and incurred higher freight costs in the spot market.","Promotional spending negatively impacted gross margin by 70 basis points, primarily impacted by higher spending in the Baking and Snacking segment. While volumes increased this segment, trade had a negative impact on margins.","Moving to the right, as we wrap both, the Plum recall and the one-time purchase accounting impact on the Kelsen acquisition, these represent a 90-basis point gain. Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 140-basis point of improvement.","Looking ahead, reflecting our revised inflation outlook and first quarter performance, we now expect our gross margin percentage of the full year to decline 50 to 100 basis points, due largely to the residual cost inflation and cost to maintain our customer service levels as we recover from the early spike in demand.","Longer term, our investments soup common platform and broad capacity will increase our flexibility to respond to volatility in demand. Importantly, we will manage the balance of the P&L to mitigate the negative impact, including our overhead and supply chain costs and our marketing programs and also evaluate price realization opportunities.","Marketing and selling expenses decreased 5%. As you may recall, we increased advertising in the prior year quarter to support new product launches and Bolthouse Farms. Marketing reductions in the current quarter reflect lower advertising spending in U.S. Simple Meals, primarily advertising production costs and a shift in advertising in U.S. Beverages to the back half of the year to support the launch of our new V-8 veggie blend platform.","Administrative expenses were down 9%, driven by lower long-term incentive compensation costs and cost savings related to prior year restructuring initiatives. Given that our annual cycle for long-term incentive compensation is at the end of the first quarter, we had favorability through this quarter and as we have discussed previously, expect a significant headwind for the balance of the year.","For additional perspective on our performance this chart breaks down or EPS growth between our operating performance and below the line items.","As you can see, we grew adjusted EPS by $0.08 per share, $0.07 of which is attributable to the growth in EBIT. Net interest expense declined $5 million versus a year ago as we reduced our debt level using the proceeds of the European Simple Meals divestiture and this contributed a penny to EPS growth in the quarter.","Our tax rate remained relatively flat, declining 40 basis points to 31.8%. We resumed repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program in a quarter, repurchasing $50 million under this program. However, given the timing, there was no impact on EPS growth in the quarter.","While currency had a point impact on sales, it did not impact EPS in the quarter.","For the full year, and based on current exchange rates, we estimate currency will have a $0.03 per share negative impact. As this was not anticipated, we have adjusted the lower end of our guidance range to reflect the impact.","Now, turning to our segment results. Sales growth in U.S. Simple Meals was 8%, driven by strong volume gains. U.S. soup sales increased 6%, benefiting from movements in retailer inventory levels, due to a strong seasonal selling and the later timing of our quarter end relative to the Thanksgiving holiday.","Sales of other simple meals increased 14%; driven by growth in Plum, Prego benefiting from white sauces and in our dinner sauce platform, which now includes Oven Sauces.","Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased 15%, with eight points of the growth due to cycling the Plum recall in the prior year.","In Global Baking and Snacking, we achieved a 3% organic sales growth, driven by the improved performance of Arnott\u2019s. We are pleased with our consumption and share gains in the Australian biscuit category given our previous challenges while Indonesia delivered another quarter of double-digit sales gains.","Within Pepperidge Farm, fresh bakery and cookie sales grew. Goldfish crackers had share gains, but sales decline. Sales of frozen products were also soft.","Operating earnings for Global Baking and Snacking increased 15%, of which 10 points was due to wrapping the negative impact of purchase accounting on the Kelsen acquisition in the prior year.","In Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, growth continued to be driven by sales gains in Bolthouse premium beverages and salad dressings. The decline in operating earnings was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage, with cost inflation across the segment.","International Simple Meals and Beverages grew organic sales by 5%. Strong sales gains in Canada were driven by innovation and higher levels of promotional activity.","Declines in operating earnings reflect the impact of increased marketing support. U.S. Beverage sales fell 3% and declined in the immediate consumption channel as we continue to implement our new route to market.","Across the portfolio, sales declined in V8 V-Fusion and V8 vegetable juice more than offset gains in V8 Splash.","Operating earnings improved as we shift the timing of our marketing programs to the back half to support the launch of the veggie blends platform. Within U.S. soup, the 6% sales growth was driven by gains in condensed and Swanson broth. Condensed eating and cooking varieties rose.","Swanson broth continues to perform well in the marketplace led by aseptic broth, which benefited from earlier holiday shipments. Sales of ready-to- serve soup were comparable to the prior year as declines in volume were partly offset by lower promotional spending as activity was shifted to the second quarter of this year. While our soup sales increased 6%, consumer takeaway in measured channels for the comparable 13-week period, ending November 2nd, declined by 2%.","Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending November 2nd, 2014, the category as a whole declined 0.5%.","Our sales in measured channels declined 1.6% with weakness in condensed and ready-to-serve soups partly offset by strength in broth.","Campbell had a 59% market share, a decrease of 70 basis points. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, with gains driven by smaller players. Private label also grew share, finishing at 13%.","We had strong cash flow performance as cash from operations increased from $38 million to $188 million, reflecting lower working capital requirements, lower pension contributions and reduced payments related to hedging activities.","Capital expenditures increased slightly to $62 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of about $400 million for the year as we increase capacity to support growth in our faster growing businesses.","We paid dividend totaling $101 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate, we repurchase 73 million of shares in the quarter, 50 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to our offset dilution from equity-based compensation.","Based in our current investment plans, we anticipate making strategic share repurchases at this pace on average for the balance of the year.","Net debt declined almost $700 million to $3.8 billion, including the proceeds from the European simple meals divestiture.","Approximately 22% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, with the Australian dollars and Canadian dollar making up the majority of our non-U.S. sales.","Since September, both of these currencies have declined in value relative to the U.S. dollar, and while not a material impact to our first quarter, if the current rates hold for the balance of the year, we will see a more meaningful impact.","At current exchange rates, we estimated to negatively impact our full year performance by one percentage point of sales, EBIT and EPS, and is the reason we are adjusting down the lower end of our guidance ranges as illustrated on the next chart.","As we announced early this morning, we have adjusted our fiscal 2015 guidance as show. Our currency-neutral expectations have not changed for sales and earnings. While we now anticipate some pressure on our gross margin percentage, we have plans in place to mitigate the impact.","We now expect sales growth of zero to plus-2%, adjusted EBIT from minus 1% to plus 2% and adjusted EPS from minus 1% to plus 2% or $2.42 to $2.50 per share. As we said previously, we anticipated stronger first quarter performance. Because we are cycling a more robust second quarter last year, we expect the first half as more consistent with our full year guidance.","Thank you. Now, I will turn it back to Jennifer.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time, out of fairness to other callers, please ask only one question at a time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia Howard","","Good morning, everyone.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Alexia.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning.","Alexia Howard","","Denise, you mentioned once or twice the fast growing parameter of the store. From what you have seen, the retail is expanding for its space at the moment and what does this mean to the shelf space in the center of the store. Obviously it is great for Bolthouse. It might be more difficult in the ambient product. Thank you.","Denise Morrison","Thank you, Alexia. You know, we have seen over the past several years a expansion and build-out of the perimeter of stores. Within the produce section however, the additional space that we are getting for the Bolthouse Kids launch is largely a reconfiguration of existing space, so pulling from other things in produce and carving out a section for Bolthouse Kids and that has been largely the way the premium beverage and the salad dressing sections have been expanded as well.","I think it is more yes perimeter space continues to expand and then within and the produce section there has been a larger dedication of space CPG items.","Anthony DiSilvestro","I would add to that, I mean, if you look at the center of store and our in our soup business, I mean, given the level of innovation we are bringing to the market with the premium expansion and soon the organic soup launch, we are expecting to gain shelf space in our soup category.","Alexia Howard","","Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Driscoll","Thank you and good morning.","Denise Morrison","Hi, David.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning.","David Driscoll","I wanted to just pull a little bit more on this gross margin issue. I mean, this looks to be a fairly significant issue. I think Anthony, you said now down 50 basis points to down 100 basis points for the full year, and previously the expectation, correct me if I am wrong, but it was up modestly was the prior expectations. Is that correct?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I think we said it is expected to be stable, so versus stable, yes we are down, now looking to be down 50 to 100 basis points and to just dimensionalize that, you know, we did not anticipate the recent increases in diary and aluminum and also what freight costs are doing and that is the majority of that 50-basis point to 100-basis point decline. The other piece of it is higher than anticipated supply chain cost related to that early spike in demand that we had to deal with.","David Driscoll","May I say that - I always thought that you had a pretty good visibility on the protein side because of your relationships with your suppliers, you know, these things didn't kind of just suddenly come up and I thought the entire purpose of that was that gaining pricing in soup during soup season is like all, but impossible. Maybe, you know, is my recollection of history correct in kind of why is it different this time?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I think, we have a pretty broad array of input cost. Certainly on proteins, it is a significant part of it and we do have good relationships always with our suppliers but the markets have been extremely volatile and I don't think we are the only ones that are seeing this type of activity. There has been issue on the supply side related to the drought. There has been issues on the demand side related to foreign buyers and this just created a lot of volatility that frankly we didn't anticipate.","David Driscoll","The way you offset this is by, number one, it is going to be lowering marketing spending. Then number two lower overhead spending. Do I have that in the right order?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I would switch the order of that and I would also add that we are evaluating price realization opportunities and also pushing on our supply-chain to, one, fix the problem and, two, contribute to those cost savings.","David Driscoll","Super. Thank you. I will pass it along.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Growe","Hi. Good morning.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. I just had a quick question for you if I could. If you look at this quarter, you are getting - you seem to be increasing contributions from the sauces business within U.S. Simple Meals, in particular as well as the premiums, so I wondered if you could give a little color around how those two products benefited the sales for that division in the quarter?","Maybe related to that, ready to serve is a little weaker than I had thought against the relatively easy comp, premium soups - ready to serve [ph] clearing and understand why that was more weaker than I thought?","Denise Morrison","Okay. First of all, we have had for the past several years a very good run with our base sauce businesses, particularly in the Prego line. Recall, part of our innovation plan was the successful launch of Prego white sauces, which has done incredibly well. We have increased our advertising against the brand. We are also advertising to Hispanics, which has been very productive for, so we are very pleased with the innovation and the brand building that has gone on in our base sauce business and pace also a very good quarter, ","One of the things that is also impacting our sauce business is the building of the dinner sauce platform. Although it started small with one initiative in Skillet, as we built from Skillet to Slow Cooker and now introduced Oven, as we have gained an additional section in the store to house these sauces and create a consumer destination, we really believe that that has added seriously to our sauce performance. Of course, this is a very good margin business for us as well.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Okay. The only thing I would add to that is Plum is reported inside simple meals and it had a significant increase in sales in part due to wrapping the recall and in part due to expanded distribution.","Chris Growe","Within ready to serve, presumably premium soups grew, that was a contributor to growth. Was there one element of ready to serve that was weak, whether that would be Chunky or Homestyle or?","Denise Morrison","Yes. There was a very good reason for that. Our ready to serve business was relatively flat and that comes mostly from promotional timing moved to the second quarter out of the first quarter relative to last year.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ken Goldman","Good morning, everyone.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Ken.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi, Ken.","Ken Goldman","Denise, you have spoken in the recent past I think about course correcting your deals a little bit deal bags, right? Going deeper in terms of discount, but maybe a little bit less broadly, I am just curious if it is still the plan, because as we look Nielsen data, we are seeing deeper levels of price discounting. You are doing what you said, but we are not really seeing a change in the percent lift from promotions, so I am just curious how you think about that, I guess breadth versus depth decision going forward here?","Denise Morrison","We do expect our total marketing to be in the range of 24% to 25% of total lift sales. Within that the mix will be different by category and we do recognize as we are very diligent about going back and looking at the productivity of our trade spending and we recognize that some of the spending last year, particularly in Pepperidge Farm and soup did not achieve the anticipated lifts. Predominantly, it came from increasing the frequency of promotion, so we do expect our overall trade rate trends to improve in the second half as we have course corrected in this area.","Ken Goldman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thank you.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Rob.","Robert Moskow","Good morning. I guess, I was wondering about this unexpected spike in demand. If we look at the sales in the quarter, they didn't come in that different from what we had modeled and I don't think it came in that different from what you had modeled, so is this a specific customer making a last-minute decision that you felt like you had to react to?","Then secondly gross margin being down 130 bips despite volume being up, Anthony, was there any kind of overhead absorption benefit from all this volume. If not, you know, why not?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. Let me start with the last part of that question. No. There wasn't absorption benefit, because we still expect to make the same full-year production, so it is just moving fixed cost with those cases between the quarters on an rate per case basis nothing really changed.","In terms of the volume spike, what you don't see when you look at the quarter is the monthly variations and we had very strong volume demands early in the quarter, so August-September and it is not a particular customer that has to do with just our overall programming and the timing of which customers place orders.","In order to meet the customer service requirements, you know, we had to run some more overtime, we had to run some more weekends and obviously that cost us a bit more and we also had to get into the freight market on a spot basis, so that is obviously a little more expensive, so it is going to take us a little while here to catch up with that requirement, but we would foresee improvements when we get to the second half of the year.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Okay. Was it on the specific line of products or not. It's mostly in our soup and sauce business in the U.S.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Eric Katzman","Hi. Good morning. Happy holidays to you and your family.","Denise Morrison","Same to you, Eric.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Good morning.","Eric Katzman","I guess, I want to follow-up on Rob's question, because I think it goes to the point. I mean, what kind of - I mean, obviously we do the timing of Thanksgiving, and you kind of have said that the shipments were well ahead of consumption, so the first part is, what are we looking for from sales in the second quarter given how much there - it seems like there was over-shipment versus consumption.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I think, that is a good point. We, as you know, benefitted from the retailer inventory movement in our last year first quarter relative to this year's first quarter. When you look at where we ended this quarter, it is within the kind of the historical ranges, but we are a bit higher than where we were last year, so it is hard to predict exactly when that will come out, but it could put some be a little bit of a headwind for us on second quarter top-line.","As we have also said, we did expect no stronger first quarter and relatively softer second quarter, and to finish the half with results more in line with our full year guidance, so this is not in unexpected, but again the thing that we did not expect was within the first quarter, the acceleration to the earlier month or two.","Denise Morrison","Yes. We actually had a stronger sell-in against back-to-school, and as predicted had our holiday shipments, some of our holiday shipments shipped in October, and in the soup business at least about 75% of our consumption actually occurs in the second and the third quarters.","Eric Katzman","Okay. Then, Anthony, I don't understand your answers to Rob's question about the volume lift and the absorptions. Are you saying that regardless of quarterly volume, you basically spread the fixed cost over the entire year, kind of like just on some kind of basis as opposed to kind of counting it more specifically within the quarter.","Anthony DiSilvestro","It actually goes with the volume, so you figure out on a fixed cost per case and you recognize those fixed costs as you sell them, so it is not straight line. It moves with the volume.","Eric Katzman","Great, so with the volume so strong in arguably the highest margin products that you have, I guess you just must have paid extraordinary cost on the freight market and I would assume Pepperidge Farm and Goldfish is a very high margin product, was that also an offset, because otherwise my guess is most investors are saying that this would have been a much bigger margin quarter.","Anthony DiSilvestro","I think, you referenced the mix benefit and we do see and you saw it on the gross margin bridge that I reviewed, so we are seeing that mix benefit. As I said, on a fixed cost per case basis, we don't necessarily see that, but we do see it in the mix line, so I think there was 30-basis point or 40-basis point of mix benefit given the performance is stoop in some of our higher margin business relative to the balance.","That being said, you know, the inflation impact on dairy, beef and aluminum and freight, is about half of that gross margin miss you know and the other half is the supply chain related costs, which you know are not insignificant and did hurt our gross margin performance in the first quarter.","Eric Katzman","All right, I will respect the time. I will pass it on and will follow-up on this, Thanks.","Denise Morrison","It was 40 basis points of mix benefit.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Denise Morrison","Hello, David.","David Palmer","Good morning. A big picture question about Campbell improving towards its long-term algorithm, I am imagining this year that Plum will have V8. Those are going to be areas of improvement this year and perhaps you can comment on that.","Thinking longer term one issue and I think Chris was hinting at this on his question, Campbell has been improving somewhat in the meal helpers, the sauces, the cooking soups, essentially helping the Millennials and others prepare meals and participating in that importantly in a higher margin way for Campbell, Over time it is certainly believable that there could be a tipping point when these platforms again higher margin platforms for Campbell could start to sort of carry the P&L to contributor revenue in a way that is not one where you are fighting the gross margins of the products that you are growing with.","Can you comment on that perhaps when you could see a tipping point like that? Thanks.","Denise Morrison","First of all, I don't think I could have articulated the strategy any clearer than you did, so thank you for that. I think that as opposed to tipping point, I think we are starting to see the impact of some mix exchange as these particular faster growing businesses come into the portfolio and are now captured in our organic sales.","I liken it to what we did with aseptic broth. Once upon a time broth was a canned business and over time we introduced the aseptic cartons and cans gradually declined, the aseptic cartons of broth increased at a very significant margins, so we were pretty excited about that.","I think it is these other businesses that will come into the portfolio and mix accordingly, but that said we are still putting a very concerted effort on our core businesses to strengthen them as well.","David Palmer","I guess the big question, the million-dollar question is whether these sauces and helpers, essentially, and some sometimes it is hard for us to teas that out of your general soup numbers, because some of these are cooking soups. When those will, again, carry that that line item in a margin-accretive way, I guess, that would be for us to just wait and watch.","Denise Morrison","Yes. I mean, I think that is right. One of the things we do know is that these types of products are attracting more affluent and younger consumer into our franchise and we are very encouraged by that.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Grainger","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Denise Morrison","Hello, Matt.","Matthew Grainger","Just to drill down on one of these newer business lines, I was surprised to see profitability down pretty sharply in the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment and granted one quarter, but you are obviously generating strong top-line growth on Bolthouse.","Foodservice seems to be in a more stable position, so is the margin contraction here during the quarter a function of the timing of investments in new products or should we think about there perhaps being Bolthouse-specific cost pressures that could persist over the course of the year or are there other factors that play just here during the quarter?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Matt, there was a couple of things. Within Bolthouse, the CPG business, so beverages and sour dressings grew both top-line and bottom-line and within Bolthouse that has been carrots, so there has been some significant inflation in there. It is partly due to the drought, so we have had higher water extraction costs and higher land cost.","We also had a higher freight cost. We were growing up in Washington state in trucking down to California and since the first quarter that production has moved to central California, so that should help a bit. The other impact is on the Foodservice business, so not in Bolthouse, significant cost inflation in the Foodservice products and also some investment we are making to expand our retail fresh business, so it is a combination of those things.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, so it is fair to say it may not be the same magnitude, but some of these things directionally could continue to pressure operating profit for the next few quarters?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I would expect things to get better.","Denise Morrison","Yes. We expect improvement.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. All right. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.","Denise Morrison","Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Hi, Bryan, same to you.","Bryan Spillane","You know, I just wanted to ask a question about M&A. Denise, we are now a couple of years into this current strategy and you have been very articulate and clear about where the M&A targets are, but at the same time there is two things that probably shifted more in the last three years.","One has been the trend towards or the size of the impact on health and wellness has become, I guess, more pronounced and larger in the U.S. Then also, international, especially developing and emerging markets, at least right now have slowed and I think there is a lot of mixed opinions in terms of when it turns and how it turns and where it turns.","Can you just talk a little bit about how you have looked at those dynamics changing, and if at all it begins to have you kind of refocus or adjust at all, your lens for where you are looking to do acquisitions?","Denise Morrison","Yes. We said previously that some acquisition may be required to further diversify our portfolio and we still believe that to be the case. That said, we have also said and still are very tight with this, we have a very disciplined approach to how we evaluate acquisitions and the strategic fit of acquisitions into our program here.","That said, we do have the financial flexibility to make a meaningful acquisition if we can find one that is a good fit and gives us the returns that we would expect to create value over time, so we still are active in this space, but we are being very disciplined about our approach to it.","Bryan Spillane","Has there been any change in focus areas or areas we are looking? Just because the global economy has slowed, things are slower in developing emerging markets and there seems to be an increased certainly appetite in the investment community, but also just broadly if health and wellness related products and categories, because you expand, has that all changed the areas where you are looking or is it still the same basket theme proportions in terms of where you were looking?","Denise Morrison","Yes. Well, if you think about the acquisitions that we have made, Plum, Organics and Bolthouse Farms in packaged fresh have both been, we believe, are very, very solid plays in health and wellness and the Kelsen business was a good add for us for international expansion, particularly with 40% of its sales in China and Hong Kong. We will continue to look or target similar to those kind of acquisitions.","Bryan Spillane","Then just one last one related to this, just in terms of investment, so rather than M&A is there any more broad thoughts to just changing, thinking investments organically in your own business to adjust towards simple ingredients are more health and wellness above and beyond what you have already done, so something you might maybe change production processes or change ingredients. Is that all part of sort of what you are looking at in terms of your investment dollars? Thank you.","Denise Morrison","Yes. I think, if you really look at the platforms for growth, in addition to what we just discussed, we have got a concerted effort on breakthrough innovation and one of platforms in breakthrough innovation is health and well being, because we have got V8 veggie blends coming, V8 protein bars and shakes. We have got advances in innovation and Bolthouse Farms and Plum and we have the new Campbell organic soups coming to market, so we are very active in innovation, in health and wellbeing space.","Packaged fresh, we just talked about and then also increasing our availability, we have got an enormous opportunity in other channels outside of grocery, particularly in an immediate consumption channels, so we are in the process of building out that network, we have put a sales team in place and we still have a lot more work to do there, but that is a great expansion space for us.","Bryan Spillane","All right. Thank you very much.","Denise Morrison","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and Happy Thanksgiving.","Denise Morrison","Hi, Akshay.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Same to you. Good morning.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning. My question is on freight cost. Can you talk a little more broadly about freight cost? A lot of companies have been mentioning that in the food space as being a headwind.","Is seems like a general industry trend that sort of snuck up on us. Is that the case? What is your read on that? Is it sort of a transitory issue? Perhaps how long might that last?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes. I think, it really stems from the carrier capacity situation and there is just significantly more demand than there is availability especially on the spot market, so it hit us two ways this quarter. One, is just a general increase in freight rates. The other, because of our volume demand, we had to exit the spot market and a higher proportion than we have done in the past.","You know what we are doing about it is, you we are trying to get more committed carrier capacity in our highest volume freight lanes and that will protect us from coming to the spot market. You may have to pay a little bit more, but it gives us some protection and our supply chain group is in the process of doing it right now, so it will be a negative impact but it should moderate as we go through the year here.","Akshay Jagdale","Thank you. I will pass on.","Denise Morrison","Our last question please?","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia, your line might be muted.","Alexia Howard","Thank you for the follow-up question. Can I just ask about the shift into digital on both, the advertising and promotional front? A number of companies have been saying that promotional spending particularly has been getting less effective of late.","I am just wondering how quickly you are shifting into digital on both, advertising and promotion, and how you can be confident that is giving you, I guess, better effectiveness as you make that shift? Thank you.","Denise Morrison","Yes. We have been experiencing and encouraging the same shaft into digital. We are up to about 20% of our spending and digital. What happens is it is the production cost of digital are less, but you need to produce more content, so there is a bit of an offset there.","Yes, you could see non working come down, because of the price of producing in digital, but then again it is a different kind of production and making sure that content is fresh and works on multiple screens sizes, but we do believe that the shift will continue. This is the way to connect with the next generation of consumers.","We still do have a significant portion of our spend in T.V., because of our large baby boomer population that still watches TV as their major media.","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Alexia, and thanks all of our callers for those questions, Happy Thanksgiving from all of us at Campbell.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the second quarter earnings call and webcast for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, our President and CEO; Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, CFO and Chief Administrative Officer; Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance; and Anna Choi, the new senior manager of IR. Welcome, Anna.","Denise will kick us off today with a strategic update, as well as her takeaways from our segment performance. Craig will offer his take on the quarter, our segment results and our guidance. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. Please keep in mind that this call is open to members of the media, who are participating in listen-only mode.","As a reminder, our presentation today includes forward-looking statements, which reflect the company's current expectations about future plans and performance. Our forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to Slide 3 in the presentation or to our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements.","Campbell completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms 1 week into the year. The acquisition is now included in our results, and it drove most of the year-over-year changes in the first half.","On September 27, we announced a $115 million pretax restructuring program designed to improve our U.S. supply chain cost structure. Our second quarter reported results reflect $42 million of pretax costs associated with that program.","Last, we signed commercial agreements with 2 large companies in Mexico, which we announced yesterday. Accordingly, our reported results for Q2 include a charge of $6 million pretax for that. Our remarks today for the balance of our presentation will be on an adjusted basis, including Bolthouse Farms' operating results for 25 of the 26 weeks of the first half, but excluding the transaction costs and the restructuring charges.","Since our presentation includes non-GAAP measures, as defined by SEC rules, we've provided a reconciliation of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation. These slides, along with our earnings release and selected quarterly financial information, can also be found on our website accessible by computer or with the Campbell IR app. In both places, next week, you'll be able to access Campbell's presentation at the CAGNY event, Consumer Analyst Group of New York event, in Boca Raton, Florida. We're presenting at 10:30 a.m. Eastern and then hosting the following luncheon. Our presentation slides will be available afterward in an archive.","And with that, let me now turn the call over to Denise Morrison.","Denise M. Morrison","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I will offer my perspective on our performance and discuss specific segment results, highlighting what's working and areas where we face challenges. Additionally, I'll provide an overview of our breakthrough innovation efforts. Finally, I'll touch briefly upon the announcement we've made yesterday afternoon to expand our business in Mexico through access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities that we have not had before. I'll then turn the call over to Craig Owens, Campbell's Chief Financial and Chief Administrative Officer, to provide details on our financial performance.","As I stated previously, our goal was to drive sustainable, profitable net sales growth. We're putting the consumer first in everything we do at Campbell as we turn around this great company. We're actively listening to consumers and engaging with them to understand their needs, and we're converting our insights into action to delight both our core baby boomers and other growing consumer segments. I'm also encouraged by the creativity and dedication of our people. All of this is beginning to have a meaningful impact on our business.","We posted solid performance in the second quarter, with net sales up 10% and adjusted net earnings up 6%. Both net sales and EBIT are up 1%, excluding Bolthouse Farms. We achieved this growth while advancing our work on cost controls and productivity improvements across the entire company. Our laser focus on brand building and innovation has helped drive our sales growth.","Most of our businesses performed well in the quarter. Sales rose in U.S. Simple Meals and in Global Baking and Snacking. The Bolthouse Farms business continues to deliver results consistent with our acquisition plan.","For the first half, with the exception of our U.S. Beverages and North America Foodservice business, our organic sales trends improved in every business relative to its results in fiscal 2012. We are encouraged by this performance. We believe that we are well positioned to deliver our full year guidance of net sales up 10% to 12%, adjusted EBIT up 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS up 3% to 5%.","I'd like to now offer a high-level perspective on our second quarter results in our reporting segments. I'll start with U.S. Simple Meals, a business that is clearly picking up steam. This business had positive sales and profit growth for both the second quarter and the first half. Sales increases were driven by improvements in dollar consumption and market share trends. In fact, as the second quarter progressed, consumption outpaced shipments.","Our growth has also resulted in improved total wet soup category performance, with dollar consumption increasing over 3% for the category, as well as for Campbell during the quarter. We ended the second quarter with sales up 1% and earnings up 10%, and the first half with sales up 2% and earnings up 7% on this large and important business.","This positive trend is largely due to our focus on brand building by optimizing all of the drivers of demand. It reflects continued investments in product taste, with new recipes on campbellskitchen.com and line extensions that have added new craveable flavors to the base business; new packaging graphics in ready-to-serve, particularly our Chunky soup line; refinements in brand positioning across the portfolio; and more effective and efficient marketing and promotion.","Some of you have expressed concerns about our reduction in advertising spending in our Soup business. Our advertising spending continues to be at competitive levels, and it has also been more effective. For example, in our -- It's Amazing What Soup Can Do campaign has worked well for Campbell's condensed soup, but our Chunky brand got lost in this portfolio campaign. Well, Chunky is back to the NFL in a big way, and the Mama's Boys campaign is resonating with our male target consumers. In the second quarter, Chunky consumption was up double digits.","Our new breakthrough innovations, specifically Campbell Go Soups in pouches and Campbell Skillet Sauces, achieved their ACV distribution goals. In December, we turned on the marketing, which was largely digital, and intended to connect with younger consumers. As planned, in the second quarter, we invested more in advertising to support these new product innovations. We are now in the early days of building trial. So far, the repeat is strong and purchases are skewed to the younger consumers who are the target demographic.","While it's still too soon to judge the long-term success of these products, we're encouraged by the early results. These new products are contributing only about 0.5 point of sales growth in the quarter. Over time, we believe these breakthrough product platforms can contribute meaningfully to our growth. In the short term, sustaining innovation, such as the Chunky line extensions, have had even more impact to our growth.","Moving on to Global Baking and Snacking, this segment also posted solid results in the second quarter, with organic sales up 6% and earnings up 4%. The Goldfish brand continues its positive momentum, driven by effective brand building and innovation. During the quarter, we increased consumption in our Pepperidge Farm sweet snacking business with a successful holiday season. We also delivered better execution and innovation focused on our iconic Milano cookies and on our soft dessert cookies, where seasonal varieties like pumpkin cheesecake and caramel apple pie were very successful.","In addition, we gained additional shelf space and merchandising in our Pepperidge Farm fresh bakery business, partially as a result of the Hostess bankruptcy, but also due to better execution, as well as innovation in our line of Swirl breads. We expect that some of the gains resulting from the Hostess bankruptcy may be temporary. But in the meantime, we will continue to demonstrate what an expanded premium offering with the goodness of Pepperidge Farm can do for our customers and our consumers.","Finally, despite continuing challenges in the retail and consumer environment in Australia, we grew biscuit sales in Asia-Pacific, both for the quarter and for the first half. The company delivered solid results for the quarter, however, I am disappointed in the sales decline in our U.S. Beverages business and the difficult conditions facing our North America Foodservice business. Although we posted a minus 3% sales decline in our U.S. Beverages business, our earnings grew 9% in the second quarter, and we realized 5% earnings growth for the first half. In the quarter, positive earnings were driven by reductions in marketing spending and productivity improvements.","V8 Splash continued to grow, but not enough to offset declines in V8 original 100% vegetable juice and V8 V-Fusion. Sales continue to be adversely affected by intense competitive activity in a sluggish shelf-stable juice category. We have started to ship our new V8 original 100% vegetable juice with improved taste and new line extensions such as Hint of Lime and Hint of Pepper. We're also focusing on new innovation in beverages to expand usage occasions with our V8 V-Fusion + energy drink and juice boxes for kids.","We intend to step up our marketing support in the third quarter, but we recognize that we have more work to do in engaging consumers and managing our costs and expenses to improve the performance of this business. Our North America Foodservice business suffered from the loss of a significant restaurant customer, higher levels of promotional support and weaker consumer traffic in restaurants, all of which impacted the business. We are working through these issues. However, we expect to experience further declines in the second half in traditional foodservice, partially offset by growth in our retail fresh soup.","Bolthouse Farms had a good quarter and a good first half, with solid performance across all 3 categories: carrots, super premium beverages and salad dressings. Both beverages and salad dressings increased dollar consumption and share. Increases in shelf presence in beverages and new product innovation were the key drivers in increasing same-store sales.","Salad dressing continued to benefit from expanded points of distribution, as well as increases in comparative store sales. The integration is progressing according to our plan.","Before I close, I want to touch on an announcement we made yesterday about our efforts to expand our international presence. We're very pleased to have entered into arrangements with Grupo Jumex and Conservas La Costena, 2 terrific companies in Mexico. These partnerships will give us expanded access to distribution and manufacturing capabilities that haven't been available to us in Mexico before. Jumex, the largest producer of fruit juices and nectars in Mexico, will manufacture and distribute Campbell's V8 portfolio throughout the Mexican market. La Costena, one of the largest producers of prepared foods in the country, will manufacture and distribute Campbell's soups, broths, and Italian sauces. We believe these arrangements will redefine the scope of our business opportunities in Mexico.","In sum, we've now completed our first half with positive results, and we're looking forward to a second half of continued investment and profitable sales growth. Our leadership team is committed to delivering superior execution in both the base business and in new innovation. We're also continuing to build a robust innovation pipeline for next year. I'll talk about some of that at CAGNY next week and more at our Analyst Day in July. We look forward to continuing to share our results with you as we focus forward.","Now I'll turn it over to Craig.","B. Craig Owens","Thank you, Denise, and good morning. I'm going to take a few minutes to walk through our second quarter results and segment highlights, followed by a look at our first half results, and then wrap up with a look at the full year sales and earnings guidance.","As Jennifer mentioned, my discussion of results will exclude the impact of all restructuring programs for the current and prior years, as well as the transaction cost associated with the Bolthouse Farms acquisition.","So for the quarter, we reported net sales of $2.3 billion, a 10% increase from the second quarter of 2012, reflecting the impact of Bolthouse Farms. Excluding the acquisition impact, organic net sales increased by 1% in the quarter. Excluding restructuring cost, which impacted both the current and prior year quarters, adjusted EBIT increased by 5%, or $349 million. Of the adjusted EBIT increase, 4 points came from adding Bolthouse and 1 point came from growth in the base business, primarily driven by strong earnings growth in U.S. Simple Meals.","Adjusted earnings per share were $0.70 this quarter, a 9% increase from the second quarter of 2012. The increase reflected EBIT growth, the benefit of a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, partly offset by higher interest expense related to the acquisition.","Our second quarter EPS results exceeded our initial expectations. U.S. Soup consumption performance exceeded our forecast, more than offsetting unfavorable retailer inventory movements and higher marketing spending behind innovation.","As you can see on Slide 21, 9 points of the 10% increase in net sales were attributable to the Bolthouse Farms acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, the growth in organic sales reflected pricing contributions of 2 points and a negative impact of increased promotional spending of 1 point. The pricing gains primarily reflected our previous list price increase on U.S. condensed soup and increases in Arnott's in Australia and soup in Canada. The promotional spending variance is primarily due to higher rates of spending in International Simple Meals and Beverages, North American Foodservice and Pepperidge Farm. We continue to invest to remain competitive in all of these businesses.","Excluding the impact of current quarter restructuring programs, our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 160 basis points to 36.8%. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, which operates with a lower gross margin structure. Excluding the acquisition, the impacts of cost inflation, increased promotional spending and unfavorable mix were largely offset by productivity improvements and the benefit of higher selling prices. The inflation rate and cost of goods sold was approximately 3% for the quarter.","Marketing and selling expense was $297 million compared to a year ago -- sorry, comparable to a year ago. Lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses were offset by higher spending to support innovation efforts, higher selling expenses and the impact of the addition of Bolthouse.","Advertising and consumer promotion expense declined by 14%, primarily due to declines in U.S. Soup and U.S. Beverage. While advertising and consumer promotion expense declined in total, we have significantly increased spending behind new product introductions.","Administrative expenses for the quarter increased $20 million, primarily due to the acquisition and higher compensation and benefit costs, including a significant increase in pension expense. Below the operating earnings line, net interest expense increased by $5 million. The increase was due to the higher level of debt incurred to fund the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, partially offset by the favorable impact of lower average interest rates on our total debt portfolio. The adjusted tax rate declined 190 basis points to 31.8%. Primarily due to the benefit of various tax planning initiatives, we recognized lower taxes on foreign earnings in the current year. With the lower tax rate more than offsetting increased interest expense, adjusted net earnings increased by 6% for the quarter.","We continue to benefit from our strategic share repurchases in fiscal 2012 as earnings per share increased 9% this quarter, reflecting a decline in diluted shares outstanding. Below the operating earnings line, net interest expense increased $5 million. The increase was due to the higher level of debt, as I said earlier, incurred due to the acquisition.","Second quarter segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown in the next slide. Sales of U.S. Simple Meals increased by 1%. Within the segment, U.S. Soup sales rose by 1%, driven by gains in ready-to-serve and condensed soup, partly offset by declines in broth. U.S. Sauce sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in Swanson canned poultry, Campbell's canned pasta, Pace Mexican sauce and the introduction of Campbell's Skillet Sauces were offset by declines in Prego pasta sauce and Chunky chili.","Our Global Baking and Snacking segment achieved strong organic sales gains, up 6%, with increases in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's. The sales increase in Pepperidge Farm was driven by growth across fresh bakery, crackers and cookies. In the bakery business, we benefited from the market exit by Hostess, with volume gains across most of the portfolio. The snacks business had another strong quarter, reflecting solid growth in Goldfish snack crackers and the national launch of Jingos! crackers. Benefiting from a very successful holiday period, we delivered a strong sales performance in cookies.","Sales at Arnott's increased primarily due to sales growth across the portfolio on Australia, including savory crackers, chocolate cookies and sweet varieties. Indonesia delivered an excellent sales growth performance for the quarter.","Organic sales for International Simple Meals and Beverages were comparable to the prior year. Strong sales gains in Latin America and growth in Canada were offset by declines in the Asia-Pacific region. Sales in Europe were comparable to the prior year quarter as sales growth in France was offset by lower export sales. In Asia-Pacific, sales decreased due to the declines in Australia and Japan, partly offset by growth in Malaysia.","Sales for the Bolthouse Farms and North America Foodservice segment were $352 million, with Bolthouse contributing $195 million. Organic sales, excluding the acquisition, declined 10%, comparable with the year -- compared to the year ago. This sales decline in North America Foodservice represents a loss of a major restaurant customer and higher levels of promotional spending at both the distributor and operator levels in order to remain competitive.","U.S. Beverage sales decreased 3% in the quarter, reflecting declines in V8 vegetable juice and V8 V-Fusion beverages, while V8 Splash sales increased slightly. The decrease in V8 V-Fusion was primarily due to declines in the existing business, partly offset by the growth in new products, including energy drinks and juice boxes.","Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased significantly, up 10%, to $191 million this quarter as we continue to improve the profitability of the business. The increase reflects strong earnings, gains in U.S. Soup, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Sauce. Within the segment, the benefit of higher selling prices, productivity improvements and lower marketing expense were partly offset by volume declines and cost inflation.","The earnings of Global Baking and Snacking increased by 4%, reflecting growth at Pepperidge Farm, partly offset by lower earnings at Arnott's. For the segment, volume gains and productivity improvements were offset by increased promotional spend and cost inflation.","Within International Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings decreased by 7%, primarily due to lower earnings in Canada, where cost inflation has outpaced higher selling price, net of increased promotional spending. Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages increased by 9% for the half. Lower advertising expenses, which were largely timing-related, and productivity improvements were partially offset by volume declines and cost inflation.","And finally, operating earnings within the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment increased by 7%, or $2 million. The increase included $15 million from the addition of Bolthouse Farms and a significant decrease in earnings from North America Foodservice. Consistent with the sales decline, the earnings decline in Foodservice is driven by customer loss and higher trade spending. We are pleased with the performance of Bolthouse Farms, which is delivering results consistent with our acquisition plan.","U.S. Soup sales for the second quarter increased by 1%. Our sales performance was negatively impacted by a decline in retailer inventory levels. Our end market performance, as measured by consumer takeaway, increased about 3%, led by gains in both RTS and condensed soup.","As you can see on the chart, our reported sales of condensed soup increased by 1%, driven by gains in eating varieties. Cooking varieties were comparable to the year-ago quarter. Ready-to-serve soup sales increased 8%, primarily due to volume-driven gains in Campbell's Chunky canned soups and the benefit of new items across the portfolio, slightly offset by declines in microwavable soups.","Broth sales declined by 12%, primarily due to movements in retailer inventory, following increased shipments in the first quarter to support holiday promotions. For the first half, U.S. Soup sales increased 2%, primarily driven by a 6% increase in ready-to-serve soup. Sales of condensed soups were comparable to the prior year, while sales of broth decreased 1% for the half. U.S. Soup consumer takeaway for the first 6 months was up about 1%.","On Slide 28, we look at our market share and category performance based on the past 52 weeks for the U.S. wet soup category. The category as a whole rose 2.2%. During the full year, our sales in measured channels rose by 0.2%, with gains in condensed soup and ready-to-serve cans mostly offset by weakness in microwavable bowls.","Campbell's had a 59% market share of the wet soup category, which includes condensed, ready-to-serve and broth. All other branded players collectively held a share of 28%, leaving 13% for private label. These figures represent dollar share and are sourced from SymphonyIRI multi-outlet data.","For the first half, we reported net sales of $4.7 billion, a 9% increase from the prior year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, organic net sales increased by 1%. The organic sales gains were primarily driven by growth in Baking and Snacking and U.S. Simple Meals, partly offset by declines in North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverages.","Excluding restructuring and acquisition transaction cost, adjusted EBIT increased by 5% to $787 million. 4 points, or $29 million of the increase, was attributable to Bolthouse Farms' operating earnings, while 1 point of growth came from the base business, primarily driven by earnings gains in U.S. Simple Meals.","Adjusted earnings per share were $1.58 in the first half, an 8% increase from the first half of 2012. The increase reflected EBIT growth, the benefit of lower tax rates and fewer shares outstanding, partly offset by higher interest expense.","In the first half, our reported net sales increased by 9%, with the Bolthouse Farms acquisition contributing 9 points. Organic sales, excluding the acquisition, increased 1%, reflecting an increase in pricing of 2 points, partly offset by the negative impact of increased promotional spending of 1 point. You'll note that the detail doesn't add due to rounding.","On a segment basis, organic sales growth in Global Baking and Snacking, U.S. Simple Meals and International Simple Meals was partly offset by declines in North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverages. Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined 160 basis points to 37.4% for the half. The decline was primarily attributable, again, to the impact of Bolthouse. The inflation rate and cost of goods was approximately 4% for the half, in line with our expectation for the full year.","Marketing and selling expenses decreased by 1% to $551 million. The decline was primarily due to our planned reduction in marketing spend, principally a 14% reduction in advertising and consumer promotion expense, partly offset by the impact of Bolthouse Farm expenses and higher selling expenses.","Administrative expense for the quarter increased $37 million due to adding Bolthouse Farms and incurring higher compensation and benefit cost, including increases in pension expense.","Below the operating earnings line, net interest expense increased $10 million due to the higher level of debt to fund the acquisition. The adjusted tax rate declined 120 basis points to 31.7%, primarily due to tax planning initiatives, which lowered our taxes on foreign earnings. Consistent with EBIT growth, adjusted net earnings for the first half also increased 5%. Adjusted EPS, benefiting from fewer shares outstanding, increased 8%.","Cash flow from operations was $499 million compared with $478 million in the prior year period. Higher cash earnings, including the addition of Bolthouse Farms, were partly offset by increased working capital requirements and higher pension contribution.","Capital expenditures of $110 million were up from $97 million a year ago. For the year, we continue to forecast capital spending of approximately $330 million, including capital spending at Bolthouse.","As we previously announced, we have suspended the strategic share repurchase program at the end of fiscal 2012 in order to reduce the debt incurred to finance the Bolthouse acquisition. However, we continue to repurchase sufficient shares to offset dilution from equity compensation programs.","Net debt rose to $4 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, due to the acquisition, partly offset by cash generation from the base business. For the first 6 months, the company paid dividends of $366 million, including accelerated payments of the January and April dividends. This total compares with $188 million paid a year ago.","This morning, we confirmed our fiscal 2013 guidance. For the year, we continue to expect to grow sales between 10% and 12%, with adjusted EBIT growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 3% to 5%. Within these ranges, currency is expected to be neutral. We now expect interest expense to increase approximately $20 million, primarily due to the acquisition financing.","The tax rate will still be between 31% and 32%. Our guidance includes the estimated impact of the Bolthouse business and excludes the impact of onetime acquisition transaction cost and those costs related to our restructuring programs.","The Bolthouse Farms acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $750 million to sales and to add between $0.05 and $0.07 to our adjusted EPS, including the impact of suspending our strategic share repurchase program.","Looking at the second half, the acquisition will have a more significant impact on our sales growth rate given our ownership for the full period and given the seasonality of our base business. While we expect EBIT growth to continue in the second half, our EPS growth will be negatively impacted by an unusually low tax rate in the back half of last year, 26% in the third quarter, 30% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.","Thank you. With that, I'll now turn it back to Jennifer.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Craig. At this time, we'll conduct a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'd like to get a little better understanding on this Mexican transition. And specifically, I have a few questions. So I apologize in advance. I'm just going to rattle off a few. First, can you give us a rough sense of how big your soup and beverage business is in Mexico right now, where the current distribution level stands, where you think distribution could go to over time? And then give us a sense of the time line for this transition and roll out.","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So Jason, we don't disclose the size of the business. But it is relatively small, right, in Mexico, while we've been there for quite some time and have developed a reasonable soup business, given that the soup business there is not primarily wet soup. And lately, we've had a lot of success with our beverage business there. Our distribution model currently is primarily in the developed trade. And really, I think the primary impact of this change is that it's going to take us, in a much better way, down market and into the smaller mom and pops and the smaller outlets that are so important, particularly to our Beverage business in that country. The time line is that we will phase out of production really across the next several quarters. But fairly quickly we will move into distribution through the third parties. And so we'll start to see some of that impact us as early as the latter part of this quarter.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Are you expecting any material impact on the overall margin profile of this business?","B. Craig Owens","Well, I don't want to get all deeply at this point into the accounting for this, but the margin will improve. We'll probably see a decline in our reported sales because of the structure of the agreement, but I think it'd be best for us to tackle that when we report the quarter where that impact begins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just want to clarify something. So if I understand you right, you're planning to increase advertising on V8 because you're not happy with the performance of the brand. You increased advertising on Chunky, and apparently the brand is reacting there, yet you're still planning to decrease advertising overall. Doesn't the success of your advertising show you that more advertising would be helpful?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. Thilo, let me take that question. There's a number of different dynamics going on in different brands. And what we've been talking about is, for each brand, optimizing all of the drivers of demand. In the V8 situation, we believe that as we introduce our new V8 with improved taste and the Hint of Lime and the new energy drinks and the juice boxes on kids, increasing our advertising in the second half is a good way, as one of the drivers for that business, in addition to merchandising and the innovation and product improvement that I just talked to you about. In terms of Chunky, we -- the biggest change on Chunky was going back to the NFL and having advertising that was a lot more productive than when Chunky got lost in the Amazing campaign last year. We think that has been huge. So across the Soup business in general, our advertising investment is still indexing significantly higher than peers. But we've used media vehicles. For example, we shifted to higher-quality GRPs and doubled our network prime GRPs, which were much more effective for us. So we've made some changes in not only the advertising campaign in Chunky, but also in the media as well. So I think that it's -- suffice it to say, that we are looking at all those drivers by brand, and we're making the decisions based on the situation the brand finds itself in.","Jennifer Driscoll","And just a fact check. Advertising was down in Soup, not up as you said, Thilo.","Denise M. Morrison","Right.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But it was -- was it up on Chunky?","B. Craig Owens","No. It was down on Chunky. I mean, it's one of the things that makes it a good example of what we're talking about. We had great response to more effective advertising on Chunky and to some of the other things that we did in the marketing mix. But advertise spend on Chunky was down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess -- we heard from Kraft this morning of inventory deloading in some of their markets. Smucker's seem to have skated through without that, but you mentioned I guess broth as a challenge. Can you -- perhaps you can kind of go into what's happening with that? I think you broadly mentioned that you undershipped consumption. But in broth, it sounds like it was a pretty tough quarter.","Denise M. Morrison","The broth business was affected by the fact that we shipped our holiday broth program at the end of October. So it actually hit in the first quarter, which raised our inventory levels. And we actually guided for that as we entered into the second quarter. Overall, for the half, broth was down 1%. So I think, overall, what we found in the second quarter as our consumption, our dollar consumption on soup picked up, we actually were seeing dollar consumption. This is MULO [ph] of plus 3.2%, with our shipments only being up 1%. So we've been outpacing our shipments with consumption. But our inventory is only up slightly at the end of the quarter, and that's in anticipation of the programming that went against the Super Bowl.","B. Craig Owens","So broth was sort of the most extreme piece of that, Eric. But for the half, it's all pretty well squared up, even within broth.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess the challenges in Beverages are -- that's been going on for a while. But Foodservice, that's not a business that we really have talked about much at all, basically, I guess, because it's been relatively small and not all that impactful one way or the other. But it sounds like that's going the wrong way in a very rapid rate. What -- I guess, is there anything really that you can do other than try to gain some accounts back sooner versus later to offset that? And how much of a drag to, I guess, earnings do you expect that to be in the second half?","Denise M. Morrison","A large portion of our sales decline, as we said, was due to the loss of a key restaurant customer, but we've also had an impact in the bottom line due to increased promotional spending. The cost of doing business in these channels have increased for us. So we're working through programs with retailers -- or sorry, with restaurants and with operators. We have a campaign for customer acquisition, but this is going to take time, and that's why we've basically said that we do anticipate that over the next few quarters, this business will continue to face challenges. The one part of the Foodservice business that actually remains a bright spot is our retail fresh soup. And the other thing that's in our profit in this business is we're investing in new capabilities that will support our ability for new customer acquisition.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so to the question about the earnings hit, can you kind of give us some sense as to how much of a drag that's going to be?","B. Craig Owens","Eric, I don't actually see the trends getting a lot better in that business. I mean, as you've pointed out, the -- there are some step-change things that happen as you acquire or as you lose customers. We're on the negative side of that this year with a pretty significant restaurant loss. And we'll keep working on expenses and customer acquisition. But I think, realistically, we're going to see that business be a negative drag through the balance of this year, and then we will have cycled that customer loss.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just looking at your full year EPS guidance, which hasn't changed, but given the over delivery in the fiscal second quarter, I guess at the midpoint of your full year range, it implies essentially no EPS growth in the second half of the year. And I'm trying to get a sense of why that would be. Is it -- we already have the higher year-over-year tax rate in our model. Is it just the Foodservice issue you just talked about and some higher spending planned in Beverages? Or is there something else there that would lead the earnings growth to slow that much sequentially?","B. Craig Owens","Well, if you look at it half to half, Andrew, the delivery on -- the implied delivery on EBIT is not very much different. So it's all about what's going on below the line, and it's the combination of cycling the very low tax rate from last year in the second half. So in the first half of this year, tax was a small favorable as we went from EBIT to earnings per share in the first half, and it's going to be a big negative as we go from EBIT to EPS in the second half. And then you've also got the fading positive impact of the share repurchase program. We suspended share purchase at the beginning of this year. So on the first half, the positive impact from that was something like 3 points, and it'll be more like 1 point or so in the balance of the year. So those 2 things are really what's going on between EBIT and EPS differently between the 2 halves.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And you'd mentioned that condensed -- I think condensed sales were essentially flat for the half. And I know there were some concerns coming into the year that you were taking some pricing on condensed and what would the elasticity be. But it seems like, at least thus far, that's been manageable and -- so I'm trying to get a sense, is that level of elasticity essentially in line with what you had planned coming in or better? And what does it tell you about the, I guess, resiliency of that piece of the business and the role it can play in your broader portfolio?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. Andrew, on the condensed soup, the performance has been better than what we expected in terms of the list price increase, and we're seeing that not only across the base but also the incremental.","B. Craig Owens","I mean, if you look at consumption data for the quarter, condensed was actually up about 3 points. So we're pretty happy with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Aaron of RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned in your prepared remarks that consumption in soup came in a little better than you expected. As you kind of look at kind of the underlying data there, does it look to you like that's a function of what you've been doing to kind of improve that business? Or was there perhaps just more of a benefit from kind of easy comps and some better weather year-over-year?","Denise M. Morrison","We have -- our conclusion on the performance this quarter really has been that our growth is driven by improved execution across the drivers of demand. We talked earlier on the call about the Chunky example, but if you think just in that one line, we've made taste improvements, we have had new innovation. In fact, 3 of the new varieties are performing in the top 5 of all RTS. We have had better positioning with the NFL. We're now being much more true to the brand target, dealing with satisfying the core male demographic. We've optimized pricing. We had better distribution and more impactful merchandising. So it's not a silver bullet. It's just been working with the brand and what it stands for in a much better way. In the advertising, we've kept it competitive levels, but we actually have more impactful advertising with the NFL. And quite frankly, you could say, \"Yes, the weather had an impact,\" but it's really hard to predict or measure weather. So basically, we think it's that plus all of the other things we're doing on the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Actually, maybe just continuing on the question of Chunky execution. It must be quite unusual to have some of those brand-new SKUs be in the top -- the top of SKUs for that entire brand. Is that because they're getting an awful lot of new promotion and merchandising support? And if so, how long is that launch merchandising support likely to last?","Denise M. Morrison","I think it's a combination of the fact that we've had better quality merchandising and more frequency of promotion, not necessarily in the depths of that promotion that's really worked for the brand this year. And the new SKUs would be promoted, at least the new base SKUs, would be promoted with the rest of the line.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And the promotion for the new SKUs, that will continue -- is there unusual promotion on those new products? And how long does that typically continue?","B. Craig Owens","There's not a lot of differentiated activity on the new SKUs within the Chunky line, Alexia. I mean, they have done very well, and we are really happy about that. But I -- the Chunky line tends to get promoted, both base and incremental SKUs together, and we're just seeing really good response to some of the new flavor adventure that we've got in the new SKUs. So it's pretty good news for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Denise or Craig, just thinking about the industry and the environment here, it seems to be picking up a little bit. And I guess in light of that, just wonder if you can maybe share your vision in terms of Global Baking and Snacking to the extent that maybe there's some white spaces in your portfolio that you'd like to fill, or maybe certain geographies where a deal could enhance your leverage or enhance your growth. Just wondering if you have any thoughts there.","Denise M. Morrison","The Global Baking and Snacking business for us has been pretty robust. And we're seeing increases in sales in both the United States and in Asia-Pacific, across the savory and the sweet. And then in the United States, we did have a windfall in our bakery business due to the Hostess bankruptcy. We were able to get extra shelf space and extra merchandising. I think that we're encouraged by those results. I don't know, Craig, if you have anymore to add there?","B. Craig Owens","Well, I mean, we have said a number of times that part of our strategy is to be a little bit more active in M&A. One of the -- certainly, in terms of category, baking and snacking is interesting to us. So if we saw an opportunity to fill portfolio whitespace, as you put it, in some of our target markets with baking or snacking assets, that would be interesting to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wanted to ask a bit more of a big-picture strategic question. Incredible news yesterday, with Heinz going off the board here with a -- sorry, a non-strategic buyer, a financial buyer. Denise, I'd really like to hear your thoughts on -- it's always been one of my beliefs, and I think a fairly widely held belief, that the combination of Campbell's and Heinz would produce just tremendously powerful cost synergies on bringing those 2 companies together. You don't need to comment -- you're probably not going to comment on Heinz, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this idea of extracting cost synergies in a really big-picture strategic sense as to what we can do with Campbell's. I mean, it does seem like there's some amazing opportunities. And to see a company like Heinz go off the board from a financial buyer who should have nowhere near the capabilities of bringing cost synergies like a Campbell's would, I'm just surprised that, that type of a transaction has happened and we haven't seen a Campbell's get involved with something like this.","Denise M. Morrison","Well, we found the news surprising yesterday as well, and we wish Heinz and all the investors well with their plans. I'm not really going to comment on that transaction. What I can comment on, though, is the fact that at Campbell's, we are constantly looking at ways that we can reduce costs and manage our margins in these businesses, and we'll continue to do so.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer of UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have a question on innovation. It sounds like some of the new flavors of Chunky have worked well. You also had Go soup and some other platforms with the idea that you wanted to broaden the shoulders of the brand, reach down into younger demographics. Could you speak to those new platforms, where there's a prospect of those being in-source because they're that successful from co-packing, which is my understanding, that those are being co-packed? And any insights there, that'd be great.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. I think the easiest way to deal with this is the fact that we've had 2 types of innovation. We've had sustaining innovation, which we've just talked about in terms of the line extensions to our base business, and then also the breakthrough innovation. The major breakthrough innovation that we've had in Soup and Simple Meals, as you've pointed out, is the Go soup and the Skillet Sauces. And to  date, they've added about 0.5 point to our sales growth in quarter 2. Let me give you a little color on this. We reached our distribution targets for ACV, although it was a slower build. But we've completed that at the end of quarter 1. And just to give you an idea, that's about 70% in the MULO [ph], and in grocery, it's about the mid-80s. Therefore, once we achieve that, we turned on the marketing mid-quarter, particularly in digital and social media and then in-store, with sharper marketing and consumer promotions. Because right now, we're in a stage where we want to drive more trial with this new demographic of millennials. And the trial is building. And where we have trial, repeat is encouraging. And so we believe that this is going to take longer to create a franchise with this new demographic, but we're very committed to it, and this is the beginning of a platform to do so. In the case of Skillet Sauces, we're really making a market here because this dinner sauce segment does not exist. And so what we've found was customers placed the Skillet Sauces in some different locations in the stores. We're learning where they should be situated. We're reading the data on that throughout this introduction. But what we've come up with and we're talking to retailers about is we envision a new dinner sauce section in the store. And we recognize that it creates -- it's going to take longer to create a new category than building on line extensions. But so far, the retailer receptivity to this idea is very good. So we're pretty encouraged by these platforms, and we're going to continue to work them and build on them. And you'll hear more about that at CAGNY.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had a question for you on the Foodservice business and just a follow-up. A lot of my other questions have been answered. So on the Foodservice side -- and obviously, the loss of a customer can hurt the business in the short run, but is there anything you need to do to that business to get it either -- whether it's from an investment standpoint or even a restructuring standpoint, I know you've got a pretty good plant there. But is there anything you can do from either of those sides to help kind of improve the performance for the new, if you will, Foodservice business?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. I -- well, so we're working actually in both of those areas. We are putting in some new capability. There's been -- particularly around soup, we think that the market growth is more about ready-to-eat soup rather than our frozen soups, and so we're making some capital investment in one of our plants there and extending not only our capacity but also our packaging capabilities. With respect to restructuring, we've been through actually some restructuring of that organization. It improved our profitability last year and the year before. I think we'll retake a look at that. But the reality is that some of the pressure, in addition to the lost customer, is coming from the -- just pressure within the industry at both the distributor level and the wholesaler level as we see pressure on prices. So we're having to respond to that. We're being competitive. It is creating a difficult business environment for us that we think we'll work our way through it. But that's the reality right now in the marketplace.","Operator","We have Jonathan Feeney with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just one quick one. The $297 million in marketing and selling expenses in the quarter you disclosed, if -- what would that have been roughly without -- I assume Bolthouse had some marketing and selling associated with it, but how much would that have been down on an organic basis? And I guess related to that, clearly you had -- did have some success with Chunky and in an environment of falling advertising expenses. So what is it that's special do you think about soup and maybe you\u2019re ready-to-serve franchise that's allowing you to get growth where, I guess -- sort of industry dogma that you need to advertise to sell product deals to accelerate volumes incrementally?","Unknown Executive","Down 2%.","B. Craig Owens","So we would have been down 2% marketing and selling expense, Jonathan, excluding the impact of Bolthouse. I think, as we've said several times, I don't want to keep -- I don't want to be repetitive. But the reality is, Chunky is responding very well to a lot of activity that we have going on across the different drivers of demand as we talk about it. Advertising is a piece of that. It's an important piece of that. We think our advertising is more effective. We think the positioning, the more unique positioning on Chunky going sort of back to its roots and getting it out from under the umbrella advertising has made every dollar that we've spent on air more effective than it was last year. And as we've also shown, and we'll talk a little bit more about this at CAGNY, the -- although we are down, and it's appropriate for us to talk about that because it's a driver from year-to-year, although we're down on our advertising spend, we are still very fully spent if you compare us to sort of industry averages against our Soup business.","Operator","We have Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So it's a one-part question. I think this year management has demonstrated that they can stabilize the Simple Meals business. And operating margins, by my forecast, anyway, look like they're going to come in around 25%. They've come in 25% almost every year for the last 4 or 5 years. And I guess my question is, is stabilization good enough right now for that business segment? I mean, would you be happy with kind of like a slow 0 to 1% kind of pace of growth and 25% margins? And if so, are you concerned that there might be dilution to the margin for the portfolio overall as you concentrate your resources on growing kind of the lower-margin parts of the businesses like Beverages and Bolthouse?","Denise M. Morrison","All right. I'm going to try and really answer this question. First of all, stabilization of this business is not good enough. And we've always said that we want to stabilize and profitably grow the business. We recognize that the business as is, is capable of a few points of growth. And it will be the innovation that we bring to the business on top of what we have today that could take that growth higher. Some of those executions will be at a lower margin, but they'll be important because they'll be reaching different consumers than what we've been able to do to date, and bringing them into the franchise. But overall, Soup and Simple Meals will be a very profitable business for Campbell's. I don't know if you have anything else to add?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. And, Rob, you're right. If you focus on margin dilution, there probably will be some, right? We talk about entering faster-growing segments, faster-growing geographies. It's very unlikely that those new spaces will have the same kind of operating margin that Soup does. But to the extent that we expect those to be incremental growth, it adds to our total growth portfolio, I'm not so concerned about margin dilution per se. And particularly, when you put it on top of not only stabilized soup business but one that has had some growth to it and one that's benefiting from increased innovation, I think the formula starts to work pretty well for us if we get all those things going at one time.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A few points of growth? Was that a 2 or a 3 behind it for Simple Meals? Or is that how I should interpret that?","B. Craig Owens","Don't have a specific forecast on Simple Meal growth going forward.","Jennifer Driscoll","Okay. Thank you for your very active Q&A session. We'll switch to Denise for her wrap-up.","Denise M. Morrison","So in conclusion, I'd like to leave you with some key points. We're encouraged with our overall performance this quarter, as we continue to make progress on advancing our 3 growth strategies. Our U.S. Simple Meals business is clearly picking up steam, with positive sales and profit growth in both the quarter and the half. It's still too soon to judge the long-term success of our breakthrough innovations in U.S. Simple Meals, but early results are as we expected. And over time, we believe these products can contribute meaningfully to our growth. In Global Baking and Snacking, we posted solid results. Our Goldfish brand continued its positive momentum, and we drove increased consumption in our sweet snacking business. We also gained shelf space with fresh bakery. And in Asia-Pacific, we grew biscuit sales for both the quarter and the half. We have more work to do to improve the performance of U.S. Beverages and our North America Foodservice business, where we lost a significant customer. Bolthouse Farms had another good quarter, driven by innovation and increased distribution across its 3 categories, and we advanced our efforts to expand our international presence through agreements with Grupo Jumex and Conservas La Costena that will give Campbell expanded access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico to grow our business. We're looking forward to a second half of continued investment and profitable sales growth.","Thank you very much for joining us today, and I look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY next week.","Jennifer, can you please provide the closing comments?","Jennifer Driscoll","Thank you, everybody.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the second quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's Fiscal 2015. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, Chief Financial Officer; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who'll participate in listen-only mode.","Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to our slide or to our SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements.","While in the current quarter we had no items affecting comparability, our comparisons of fiscal 2015 with fiscal 2014 will exclude previously-announced items. Also our fiscal 2015 guidance is on a 52 week to 52 week adjusted basis to a 53 weeks last year. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we've provided in our appendix, a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. And with that, let me turn the call over to Denise Morrison.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Today I will share my perspective on our second quarter and first half performance, our plans for the remainder of the year, and finally, our initiative to create a new enterprise structure while driving significant cost savings over the next three years.","Our CFO, Anthony DiSilvestro, will discuss our financial performance and segment results in greater detail, and then we'll have time for your questions.","My perspective about the second quarter is highly influenced by some of the factors we shared with you during our first quarter call. As a reminder, we had strong first quarter, with organic net sales up 5%, adjusted EBIT up 9%, and adjusted EPS up 12%. Recall that in quarter one, we experienced higher input costs than expected and this situation continued into quarter two.","We started the year with a stronger seasonal sell-in. We also had more holiday promotion activity ship in quarter one because of the timing of our quarter and relative to Thanksgiving. This shift drove sales growth in Campbell's condensed soups, Swanson broth and our Pepperidge Farm stuffing businesses ahead of consumption. The strong first quarter put pressure on our supply chain to maintain acceptable customer service levels.","To serve our customers, we ran our plants overtime, and shipped product from all over our network to meet the increased demand. We also increased our use of spot market transportation, which resulted in higher rates in a constrained market, and fueled additional cost.","These supply chain issues continued into the second quarter, as we made the decision to incur additional expenses to improve our customer service levels. With this as background, let me now offer my perspective on our second quarter results.","Our organic sales performance was comparable to year-ago. In the quarter, declines in U.S. Soup were impacted by quarter one sales growth which benefited from movements in retailer inventory levels and the timing of quarter end relative to the Thanksgiving holiday. This had an expected adverse impact on Q2 soup sales.","In the quarter, we delivered positive sales growth in our large U.S. sauce brands, Prego and Pace, as well as in Plum Organics baby food, in the CPG portion of Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings and in our Foodservice business. I was pleased with our Global Baking and Snacking business which delivered solid organic top line growth as well as strong bottom line growth with contributions from both Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm.","I was not satisfied with the performance of the U.S. Beverage business. Sales of our V8 V-Fusion franchise declined, while V8 Splash and V8 + Energy performed well in the quarter. In January, we started shipping our new V8 Veggie Blends, which have been well received by our customers.","Our biggest disappointment in the quarter was our gross margin performance. As I mentioned previously, we continued to face persistent challenges with increased inflation and cost pressure in logistics including higher transportation and warehousing costs, and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses.","Despite our efforts to reduce expenses, we posted a double-digit EBIT decline greater than we anticipated. Anthony will discuss our gross margin performance and outlook in much greater detail in a few minutes. As a reminder, at the close of our first quarter we told you that we didn't expect our performance in the fiscal 2015 to be evenly distributed across quarters. As a result, we said at that time that evaluating our business performance on a first half basis rather than a quarterly basis would be more meaningful. We still believe a first half view gives the most informative picture of the business.","Turning to our first half performance, organic sales increased plus 2%. For the half, four of our five reporting segments achieved organic sales growth, with gains in U.S. Simple Meals including steady sales in U.S. Soup. We posted positive organic sales in Global Baking and Snacking, Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice and International Simple Meals. Sales of U.S. Beverages declined.","It is important to note that our recent acquisitions, Plum and the CPG portion of Bolthouse Farms, posted double digit sales gains for the half and Kelsen biscuit sales increased as well. For the half, our gross margin was under pressure with the continuation of the input costs that were higher than anticipated and the supply chain issues that I previously discussed.","Turning now to the back half, we plan to focus on fewer, bigger innovation platforms across our portfolio. As discussed at CAGNY last week we believe this approach will have a more significant impact on the top line and reduce complexity in our supply chain.","In the back half, we will continue to ramp up our health and wellbeing platform across our business. Our health and wellbeing platform includes new Campbell's organic soup and the continued expansion of our Healthy Request line of soups. We're increasing the distribution of new V8 Veggie Blend juices for affordable mainstream juicing and V8 Protein Bars and Shakes, which are expanding the brand into adult on the go nutrition.","In the Packaged Fresh category, this spring we're launching 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, a new cold pressed ultra premium organic juice. We will continue to expand Bolthouse Farms kids fresh beverages, veggie and fruit snack tubes and carrot veggie snackers in the produce section.","And we also have spring flavor innovations in place for super premium fresh beverages including an on-trend blueberry banana almond milk variety and new varieties of salad dressings. In Simple Meals, we will introduce a range of premium and convenience platforms including the expansion of our dinner sauces line with the addition of grilling sauces. We're also preparing for the launch of Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soup and K-Cup. Our joint development project with Keurig Green Mountain. And finally, we will introduce Prego and Pace ready meals in convenient on-the-go microwavable pouches.","We've also taken actions to address the supply chain issues that are within our control. For instance, we are making significant improvements to our freight and transportation management, while our service level to customers and cost management is improving.","We're taking steps to increase net price realization on our core business. We believe that these steps will help our gross margin performance improve, starting in the third quarter. And finally we're managing SG&A and other costs aggressively across a number of areas such as travel and hiring. Even with these efforts, we don't expect to offset the full impact of the margin pressures that we experienced in the first half.","We recognize the challenging environment that we and our peers are operating in, particularly in center store categories. Consumer behavior and their preferences with respect to food are changing. There are many seismic shifts impacting our industry, which I discussed last week at CAGNY. We're taking these shifts into consideration, as we pursue our dual mandate to strengthen our core business, while at the same time to expand into faster-growing spaces.","We recently announced a new enterprise structure to better align our organization to deliver on our strategy. After considerable thought and planning, we are reorganizing our company to unlock greater value from our people, brands, and assets. This work is under way, and will ramp up in the back half. We expect the creation of our three new divisions: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Packaged Fresh, coupled with our efforts to simplify our organization structure, will result in streamlined operations, better execution, and improved financial results over time, all while delivering fewer, bigger product innovations that will delight consumers.","As we implement this leaner and flatter organization structure, we're also adopting zero-based budgeting in fiscal 2016 to drive cost savings and to instill new cost discipline at Campbell. Together, we expect these initiatives to ramp up to annual cost savings of $200 million-plus over a three-year period.","This is a difficult time across the food industry. While we have made solid progress at Campbell's over the past 3.5 years to reshape our portfolio, it has not been enough. We're making necessary changes at our company, changes to the way we organize and manage our business, and changes to the way we allocate resources and assets while managing costs to fund our growth. Simply put, we are taking more aggressive action on multiple fronts, while staying resolutely focused on the consumer to change the growth trajectory of our business.","Thank you, and now I will turn the call over to Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details I wanted to give my perspective on our second quarter performance and revised 2015 guidance.","First, we are pleased with our overall sales performance. Organic sales following 5% growth in the first quarter were flat in the second quarter, with the first half now at plus 2%.","Our updated sales guidance reflects an increased headwind from currency. Excluding currency, our sales outlook remains unchanged from our previous 2015 guidance. However, reflecting disappointing gross margin performance, second quarter EBIT was down 17%, and below our expectations. I'll discuss the details of our gross margin performance shortly.","Importantly, for the balance of the year, we expect to see improved gross margin performance as inflation and supply chain headwinds moderate, and we take actions to improve our net price realization. As we announced on February 12, given our second quarter performance and revised outlook for the balance of the year, including the impact of currency translation, we lowered our full-year guidance.","Now, I'll take you through our second quarter results segment highlights, and then review the guidance. For the second quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined by 2% to $2,234 million due to the negative impact of currency translation.","Organic net sales were comparable to the prior year, as gains in both our Global Baking and Snacking and our Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segments were primarily offset by declines in U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages. Following a strong first quarter, sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by movements in retailer inventory levels, including earlier holiday shipments that benefited the prior quarter. With these timing related items now behind us, first half reported sales increased 1% with organic sales gaining 2%.","Adjusted EBIT in the quarter fell 17%, due to a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable currency, partly offset by reductions in marketing spending. For the first half, adjusted EBIT declined 4% as the negative impact of a lower gross margin percentage and currency were partly offset by volume gains and lower marketing and administrative expenses. Reflecting lower interest expense and a lower tax rate, adjusted earnings per share decreased 13% to $0.66 in the quarter. At $1.40 for the first half, adjusted EPS is down 1%.","Decomposing our sales performance, favorable volume mix contributed one point to sales growth. Gains in volume mix in the Global Baking and Snacking and Bolthouse and Foodservice segments were partly offset by declines in U.S. Simple Meals, the segment most impacted by the inventory and holiday shipment timing between the first and second quarters. Higher selling prices, primarily in Global Baking and Snacking, added 1 point of growth.","Overall, increased promotional spending lowered sales by 2 percentage points. The pressure came largely from the Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Simple Meals segments. Currency reduced sales by 2 points as our two primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar both weakened further against the U.S. dollar.","Here's our gross margin bridge for the second quarter. Our gross margin declined by about 3 points in the quarter compared to the prior year. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 3.6 points. About two-thirds of this was cost inflation, which as a rate, increased by approximately 4%, reflecting continuing increases in meat, tomatoes, dairy, steel cans and chocolate, and includes the negative impact of mark to market losses on open commodity hedging contracts.","While inflation was slightly higher in the quarter than anticipated, we expect inflation to moderate in the back half. The remaining third came from our supply chain, where we experienced increases in manufacturing costs, in freight and distribution, and from the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses.","I'll comment further on the first two. Our manufacturing costs are higher, as we've temporarily increased the use of co-packers to meet short-term demand and from an equipment outage in one of our major plants. On freight and distribution, to meet our customer service levels, we've incurred higher transportation costs based both on our usage and rates, the impact of which we've seen moderate during the quarter. Looking ahead to next year, our investments in soup common platform, broth capacity, and changes in our committed freight capacity should mitigate the impact of these factors.","Promotional spending negatively impacted gross margin by 100 basis points, primarily due to higher spending in the Baking and Snacking segment, and while volumes increased in the segment, trade had a negative impact on margin. Higher selling prices, primarily in Baking and Snacking, added 40 basis points. Lastly, we continued to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 130 basis points of improvement. As I'll discuss in connection with the guidance, we expect that our gross margins will expand slightly in the second half.","Marketing and selling expenses decreased 10% in the quarter, reflecting reductions in advertising in U.S. Simple Meals and Pepperidge Farm, helping to offset some of the gross margin pressure. Administrative expenses were down 1%, as lower benefit costs, cost savings from prior restructuring initiatives and the impact of currency were mostly offset by increased long-term incentive compensation costs compared to the prior year, which benefited from reduction in estimated payouts.","On the topic of incentive compensation more broadly, we now expect a full year 2015 headwind on incentive compensation costs of approximately $0.06 per share, compared to our original estimate of $0.09 per share, as we have lowered our assumption for estimated payouts on long-term and annual bonuses.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS growth between our operating performance and below the line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS declined by $0.10 per share, $0.12 of which is attributable to the decline in the EBIT.","Net interest expense declined $4 million versus a year ago as we reduced our debt level, and this contributed $0.01 to EPS growth in the quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter was 27.9%, down 310 basis points, versus the prior year adjusted rate, due to the favorable resolution of an inter-company pricing agreement between the U.S. and Canada. The lower tax rate in the quarter added $0.03 to EPS.","We now expect a tax rate for fiscal 2015 in the range of 30% to 31% versus our previous guidance of 31% to 32%. Under our strategic share repurchase program, we repurchased $15 million in the quarter bringing the year to date total to $100 million. With rounding you don't see an EPS impact on the quarter. Currency had a $0.02 impact on EPS. For the full year and based on current spot rates, we estimate currency will have a 2 point or $0.05 per share negative impact.","Now turning to our segment results, sales declined in U.S. Simple Meals by 3%, primarily driven by volume declines and higher promotional spending. U.S. Soup sales decreased 6% following a 6 point gain in Q1 as the timing between quarters was impacted by movements in retailer inventory levels and the timing of our quarters relative to the Thanksgiving holiday.","Sales of other Simple Meals increased 6%, driven by growth in Plum, Prego, and our dinner sauce platforms. Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals declined primarily due to higher inflation and the supply chain costs I discussed earlier.","In Global Baking and Snacking, 4% organic sales growth was driven by the strong performance of Arnott's. We achieved consumption and share gains in the Australian biscuit category, and Indonesia delivered another quarter of double digit sales gains.","Within Pepperidge Farm, Goldfish crackers delivered strong sales gains which were partly offset by softness in frozen products. Kelsen sales declined slightly reflecting the shift of the Chinese New Year further into our third quarter.","Global Baking and Snacking posted strong operating earnings driven by the organic sales growth and lower marketing spend. In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic growth was driven by sales gains in Foodservice and in Bolthouse premium beverages and salad dressings, while Bolthouse Farms carrot and natural ingredient sales declined. The decline in operating earnings was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage and higher administrative expenses as the prior year benefited from a reduction in long-term incentive compensation accruals.","The decline in gross margin percentage reflects higher carrot costs including the impact of adverse weather. International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 2%, with lower sales in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. Sales in Canada were comparable to the prior year following a very strong first quarter.","Declines in operating earnings were due to cost inflation. The adverse impact of currency on input costs and the negative impact in currency translation. U.S. Beverage sales fell 4% as declines in V8 V-Fusion more than offset gains in V8 Splash. Operating earnings declined primarily due to higher promotional spending, including new an item introduction cost, cost inflation and increased supply chain costs.","For the first half, I want to focus your attention specifically on the performance of the U.S. Simple Meals segment. With the timing shift in Q1 and Q2 now behind us, U.S. Simple Meals sales increased 2% for the half, driven by volume gains in the segment. U.S. Soup sales were comparable to the prior year, while sales of other Simple Meals increased 10% driven by growth in Plum, Prego and our dinner sauce platform.","Operating earnings declined 3%, reflecting cost inflation and higher supplier chain cost, partly offset by productivity improvements, lower marketing expenses, sales gains, and the benefit of lapping the Plum recall in the prior year. For the remaining segments the results for the half were similar to those of the second quarter.","Within U.S. Soup, 6% lower sales in the second quarter was due to declines in condensed and Swanson broth, which were impacted by the timing of shipments between first and second quarters while ready-to-serve soup sales were comparable to the prior year. While our soup sales decreased 6%, consumer take-away in measured channels for the comparable 13-week period ending February 1, declined 1%.","For the first half, as shown at the bottom of the chart, soup sales in aggregate were comparable to the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed was offset by 7% growth in broth, with ready-to-serve sales comparable to the prior year. We ended the quarter with retailer inventory positions comparable to the prior year.","Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending February 1, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.2%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.9% with weakness in condensed and ready-to-serve partly offset by strength in broth. Our share declined 50 basis points in the last 52 weeks, and has been relatively stable over the past two years.","All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, with gains driven by smaller players. Private label also grew share, finishing at 13%.","We had strong cash flow performance in the first half as cash from operations increased by $221 million to $584 million, as we've wrapped the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and due to lower working capital requirements and pension contributions in 2015.","Capital expenditures increased to $143 million. We continued to expect capital expenditures of about $400 million for the year as we increase capacity to support growth in our faster growing businesses. We paid dividends totaling $199 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate we repurchased $133 million of shares in the half, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity based compensation. Based on our current plans we anticipate making strategic share repurchases at this pace on average for the balance of the year. Net debt declined by approximately $200 million to $3.7 billion.","Now I'll step through our 2015 guidance which is consistent with our news release on February 12. As a reminder growth rates are based off a 52-week adjusted fiscal 2014 base. Beginning with net sales, we expect changes in net sales to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 4%, including a currency headwind of 2 points.","Excluding currency, our sales outlook is unchanged from our previous guidance. We expect adjusted EBIT to decline between minus 7% and minus 5%, reflecting weaker than anticipated gross margin performance. While first half performance has been impacted by inflation, supply chain costs and currency, we expect improved year-on-year performance in the back half, as inflation and as supply chain impacts moderate as we exit the season and we realize the benefit of several list price increases and promotional spending reductions, which are now in the marketplace.","For the full year, we forecast that our gross margin percentage will decline by approximately 1 point. At EPS and reflecting a tax rate in the range of 30% to 31% and interest expense slightly below the prior year, we expect adjusted EPS to decline between minus 5% and minus 3%. A range of $2.32 to $2.38.","In terms of quarters, directionally, we expect a relatively weak third quarter followed by a stronger Q4. As we discussed at the CAGNY conference last week, we have launched a major cost reduction initiative targeting a $200 million-plus annual cost opportunity by adopting a zero-based budgeting approach. While we expect to deliver savings beginning in our fiscal 2016, we do not anticipate a material impact on our 2015 results.","As we said last week, we are in the early stages and will have more to say about the initiative and impact on our performance as we make progress. That concludes my remarks and now I'll turn it back to Jennifer for Q&A.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Anthony. Kate, we will now start our Q&A session. Our audience, we'd ask you that since we have limited time, please ask only one question at a time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, Good morning.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Chris.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I just have two quick questions. I'm sorry; you said keep it to one. Let me just do it in one then and really just focus on the gross margin. Anthony, can you give more color around the increase in transportation costs? Like some of the unique factors that led to the weaker gross margin performance in the quarter. I know you talked about these in some overall detail, but I'm just curious how much incremental, say, transportation costs were. Is that one of the big drivers of the weaker gross margin performance?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, as I said in my remarks if you look at the gross margin bridge, we had cost and inflation other factors of 3.6 points. About a third of that is the supply chain issue and the largest single one within there is freight and distribution.","And as Denise mentioned, we have prioritized maintaining our customer service levels over some incremental costs. So what that's resulted in is some more inter-plant shipments, less use of intermodal and higher utilization of the spot market at a time when carrier capacity has been constrained and the rates have been higher. So those three things are really the primary drivers of the costs in freight and distribution. Those which are a pretty significant part of the supply chain costs that we've been talking about.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then would input costs be like the remainder or the vast majority of the remainder of the incremental gross margin weakness in the quarter?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, when you talk about year over year performance, inflation is the single largest factor. So two-thirds of that 3.6 points decline is inflation. Things like meats and tomatoes and chocolate and dairy are all increasing double digits. Steel cans is single digits and made worse by mark to market on some diesel hedges that we had that were under water in the quarter.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi. Good morning.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi. Good morning.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess I will ask more of a philosophical question on marketing. It's sort of surprising to see your marketing spend continue to shrink. I was just looking through it in the first half; it's now down to 25% from where it was 10 years ago. And your sales continue to suffer. How should we think about marketing on a go-forward? Are we in an environment or a world now where advertising spend, the deflationary pressure on the efficiency of digital has enabled us to be at a point where we can continue to trim it? Or do you still believe that marketing is a very important driver of top-line growth? And as we think about the go-forward at Campbell, should we be expecting and modeling for a degree of reinvestment in marketing on a go-forward?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jason, we do try and keep total advertising consumer and trade at about 25% of sales. In the first half, our soup advertising was not cut. What we are lapping is the launch of Prego white sauces and dinner sauces, so the advertising spend in the simple meal portion was down, and also lower advertising on U.S. Beverages as we chose to spend more on that in the back half against the introduction of the V8 Veggie Blends.","The other thing that we did was in the biscuit business, we did have a higher trade on Pepperidge Farm as we drove more merchandising, in particularly the second quarter, and in Arnott's, we had a price increase and we did spend trade to make sure we protected promoted prices in the marketplace.","The other thing that affected trade was soup, the launch of our new organic soup, and also the launch of Veggie Blends where we put new distribution funds in place on those two businesses.","Going forward, we absolutely believe that advertising is a solid grower of top line, as is consumer, and as we work through our new divisions and their portfolio roles, we will be making sure that we're allocating those investments to the places that have the greatest profitable growth opportunity for us.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just to add to Denise's comments, as we look to the $200 million cost opportunity, we believe some of that can come from our non-working or discretionary marketing spend, so we'll be looking at that area pretty closely.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we'll be able to make that distinction.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. I'm going to try to cheat and squeeze in one quick follow-up. You talked on looking at spend as an entire bucket, inclusive of trade spend. Your promo line has been moving higher; I should say as a contra-revenue indicator moving lower for eight years. And you're now citing gross margin disappointment on sort of the net price realization.","So clearly it's a problem, the degree of trade spend and the lack of efficiency on it. How do you address that? And after eight years of putting more money in, is it really feasible to imagine you'd be able to pull money out and get a net benefit on that in the go-forward?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, we've been doing quite a bit of analytics on our trade performance in the marketplace and on the appropriate pricing. So we've been able to really understand with a new level of granularity where we've invested and the return on that investment, and we will be reducing less profitable or less ROI trade in the marketplace. That's our approach.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, just to add to that in terms of our back half net price realization efforts, we've announced pricing on our Simple Meals segment across 30% of the portfolio at an average of 5.7%. So we're taking pricing on some of our Red & White SKUs, we're taking pricing on Prego, we're taking pricing on Campbell gravy. And we're also reducing our promotional spending in a couple of our key businesses. I won't name those for competitive reasons, but we should be seeing some moderation on trade in the back half here.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks a lot guys. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, there. Can you hear me?","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Perfect. I know we focused a little bit at the conference on the overall trajectory on margins, but can I just focus specifically on the soup segment?","Just from looking at what's going on in the grocery stores, there seems to be a shift into newer products that are in cartons and other new packaging formats, not necessarily the cans. And Campbell's is obviously joining this trend with the organic soups (36:46) and so on. How does that affect your margins over the long-term?","In the near term, I imagine using co-packers reduces the margins. Longer-term if you were able to scale those and bring them back in house, would the gross margins be comparable? And is there also margin pressure across the U.S. Simple Meals category, if the new pouched skillet and dinner sources are replacing sales of condensed soup for cooking? Thank you very much.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Alexia, I do think that the major shift for us in terms of out of the can packaging has been in the area of premium soup which has been a place where we've expanded our Campbell's Slow Kettle in tubs, our bisques in boxes, and now our new organic soups, which are also going into that segment. And that segment is growing. And that segment also commands a higher price point, so we're very pleased with the margins that are in that particular segment.","That said, the canned soup business is still several billion dollars, and very profitable, and so bringing news to the core business is also an important part of our program here. And I think the best example I can give you in terms of margins is on the broth business. Recall once upon a time, Swanson broth was 100% in cans, and over time, after the introduction of the aseptic Swanson broth at a higher retail and very solid margins, we've been able to manage that conversion at the pace that the consumer has taken us there. And so, we now have two very profitable offerings in that particular space. So I hope that answers your question.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Is that a model that you can use directly in the canned soup business to migrate it over to those aseptic cartons, or does the FDA prevent that?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think that \u2013 again, there are many consumers that continue to buy canned soup, and there are some that choose to buy soup in other packages, and we believe we are bringing the consumer a choice model depending upon what their preference is, and we make sure that our margins are acceptable.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","This is Jennifer. I was just going to add, you probably noticed our new organic soups in the cartons do have garnish.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, it would be great to see more of that. So, thank you very much, I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Diane.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Diane.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. I wanted to ask about your comment on reducing the amount of innovation, but making \u2013 sort of scaling it and making it more impactful. So last summer when we came to your Analyst Day, you obviously had a lot of innovation, you showed us. It seems like there's a little shift in strategy there given what's going on in the center of the store. Can you just talk about what you envision in terms of like platform innovation? How many will we see per year? What is the bogey in terms of sales that you have to hit in order for it to be considered successful? I just want to understand a little bit better the strategic thinking behind that and how you will assess it going forward.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, let me take you back 3.5 years, where we had no innovation pipeline on our soup and Simple Meals business and our sustainable innovation was driving about 5% of sales from new products on a rolling 3%. Fast forward to today, where we have built a pretty robust innovation pipeline in that business, and our sales from \u2013 in new products introduced in the last three years now, are about 11%. We would like to get them to between 13% to 15%, so we still have more work to do, but we are totally in a different place.","That said, we've been able to go back and look at literally the plethora of activity in that space, and what we've realized is if we can cluster our innovation into fewer, bigger platforms that have scale in the marketplace and can have a bigger impact, that would be a better program that we are now prepared to run.","And so, for example, if you look at health and wellness, innovation in the organic space, innovation in the fresh space, and innovation in vegetable nutrition, are three big platforms that we believe we can build out. In Simple Meals, our whole dinner sauces with skillets, oven, slow cooker, and now grilling, can be a platform that will have a meaningful difference in the category. And so, those are two examples of how we're starting to look at it.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","So is the company scaled for larger innovation platforms in fiscal 2016, or is it more fiscal 2017 where we should look for larger impactful platforms?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I believe what you'll see is us building on to the platforms that we've already initiated, and coming out with new bigger ones over the next couple years. Because we still are very committed to brand building and innovation as a way to drive sustainable profitable growth.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Thank you. Hey, Anthony, I was listening to the reconciliation of gross margin and it seemed like a lot of these issues were things that you had mentioned on the first-quarter call already. So I guess I wanted to know what was the major surprise. Since you were already talking about spot rates and intermodal traffic in first quarter, what made it worse in second quarter that you didn't expect?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I would break it down into three areas. The first was cost inflation. So I quoted some numbers on categories earlier. Those numbers were a little higher than, frankly, than we anticipated, and a mark to market on diesel was a little higher than we anticipated.","The second is in this area of freight and distribution. We talked about in the first quarter that we got a little bit behind, given an early spike in demand, and that continued further into the second quarter than we anticipated. Quite frankly, as we decided to prioritize keeping up on customer service over some of these incremental cost issues. So I think it's the same factors that have just pushed into the second quarter a little bit further than we've anticipated.","And the third impact I'd point out is, the dollar continuing to strengthen has had a larger impact on input costs of some of our international businesses than we anticipated.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Campbell's done a lot of work to make the supply chain more efficient. Productivity pops up all the time as a benefit. Are you at all concerned that maybe, as you've changed your supply chain footprint, that you've reduced the flexibility in the footprint at the same time and that could have led to some of these issues? Or am I just jumping to a conclusion?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, we've talked about that. We look back at some of the actions we've taken, primarily the closure of the Sacramento plant. We achieved very significant savings from that initiative. And I think, in comparison, these costs that we're seeing here are relatively minor compared to that. We believe we understand the causes of them. We believe we're addressing them. We're starting to see them moderate. And we expect the worst is behind us from here going forward.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, our supply chain continues to deliver about 3% in productivity every year. And with the soup common platform and plant of the future, it actually is introducing much more flexibility into the footprint to be able to manufacture products beyond the can.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you, Denise.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC. Your line is open.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. You mentioned condensed is down a few percent. If you break down condensed between eating soups and cooking soups, what are the trends in each? And if you want to extend it back a couple quarters to make it even, please go for it. And what is the percentage of the breakdown between eating and cooking soups currently in condensed? Thanks.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, they're about equal weight. I think the way to answer the question is: Longer term, we've seen relatively better performance out of cooking soups than eating soups. Cooking soups being more on trend with consumer behaviors around, obviously, cooking and recipes. While the eating soups, given all the activity in ready-to-serve, there's been some migration from eating soups to ready-to-serve soups, and I think that's been the primary factor over the longer term negatively impacting condensed eating varieties.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and I would just add that the three icons still remain very strong in condensed soup, and where we've seen the impact is in the other eating with the interaction with ready-to-serve.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I mean, that really is the nature of the question is that you wonder if there might be a time one, two, three years down the road where your sauces, your broths, and then your cooking condensed varieties together get to a scale and they're on trend with the Millennial eating patterns that that could be a high-margin sort of savior to your growth, whereas some of your other growth areas are lower margin in nature. I wonder if you see that getting to critical scale within some time horizon. Is that a fair question?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we tend to view the business that way. And in fact, it comes together really nicely on CampbellsKitchen.com, we were able to suggest many recipes using both broth and also our cooking soups to make fresh food taste great. And so, we do see a scale play in terms of our cooking varieties. That said, we still have a very nice business in our other eating condensed, as well.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Erin Lash with Morningstar. Your line is open.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","Thank you. I was hoping you could just kind of address, in line with the discussions, regarding some of the innovation. You've been quite upfront about the fact that center of the store has been struggling. We've seen that in the numbers. Kind of the positioning of those new products, whether you think that they will drive traffic in the center of the store, or positioning within the perimeter, and kind of how those discussions with retailers are going.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think it's important that when you run an innovation program, there has to be an acceptance that some of the innovations are going to hit, and some of them are not. And the trick is, is to figure out which ones are the winners, and put your money and investment behind those, and figure out which ones are not, and pull them away. And I believe we have been running that kind of program.","But we've seen some very important innovation to our core business, for example, in pub-inspired chunky soup, which has introduced a whole new line of innovation to that particular franchise. We also were very pleased with the building of the dinner sauce platform that I talked about earlier. Those are two examples where we've really hit the mark.","The other place, too, is in the premium soup. We've been able to get 4 feet extra for premium soup in the stores, which has enabled us to expand Slow Kettle and the boxed soup, and also provide a home for our new Campbell organic soup. And, again, as I mentioned, that segment is growing nicely.","We've introduced Goldfish Puffs in the Pepperidge Farm franchise, which are gluten free. But we also introduced Jingos! a couple years back that didn't work. So, there is always going to be a mix, and what we are pleased with is that we're hitting more than we're missing.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","So suffice it to say, most of the innovation will continued to be I guess positioned within that center of the store as opposed to the perimeter?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry if I gave you that impression. We have a very robust innovation pipeline in the perimeter, with our Bolthouse Farms business. In beverages, we're introducing new blueberry banana almond milk, and a couple new salad dressings. In addition to 1915, which is the ultra premium cold-pressed juice, and we also have an innovation pipeline that's looking at other categories in the perimeter where we can bring Campbell's capabilities. So there's a lot of activity going on in that space.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Denise, just wanted to address U.S. Beverages for a minute. Performance is pretty weak there and I guess it's clearly not from a lack of effort. But at this point you've already pushed through new packaging, new advertising, new flavors; you've renovated with corn syrup removal and yet it seems price reductions are more of an everyday lever, and without a volume response. So what comes next? Is this just an example of a category moving away from you structurally with V8? Do you have to look outside at maybe different brands or segments at this point? Just your thoughts there.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the shelf stable juice category has been really sluggish for a couple years. And I think that one of the big drivers is most of the juice in that category contains sugar, and there's been a movement on the part of consumers to really pay attention to that. That said, we are pretty well positioned having vegetable based Beverages. And we decided a year ago to really rethink that whole offering from V8, which is why we spent a great deal of time developing the V8 Veggie Blends, gaining some expertise from our part of the business at Bolthouse Farms.","We're just getting those vegetable blends in the marketplace today, but what we believe is that that will offer consumers great-tasting vegetable juice alternatives that are mainstream priced, and we believe will add a jump start to our V8 business. In addition, we only have 10% of our business in single-serve, whereas most beverages have about 50%. So, we are still very committed to increasing our V8 business in single-serve immediate consumption. And with the Veggie Blends, we'll have more of a breadth of line to offer our distributors in the marketplace.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, outside of the Veggie Blends, what are your thoughts on just the core tomato franchise? Has that weakened at all at the consumer in terms of change in preferences?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The core tomato franchise has always been polarizing. There are people who either like tomato or who don't like tomato. And we haven't been able to offer the people that don't like tomato base a different alternative. So we believe that tomato will still be an important part of our franchise for those who love it, and we'll be able to offer other things, as well.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Denise.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Akshay.","Lubi John Kutua - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. This is actually Lubi on for Akshay. I just wanted to ask about performance in Bolthouse in general. It seems that top-line performance and maybe profitability as well in that segment has been trending somewhat below your original expectations when you first entered the sort of faster-growing packaged fresh category. So, first, is that a fair characterization? And then, if that is the case, can you talk a little bit about what's driving the relative underperformance and how you are thinking about growth in Bolthouse longer term? Thank you.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I can take that. I would split the business into two parts. Think about the CPG, beverages and salad dressings, those businesses, we're very pleased with the performance of those businesses both top and bottom-line. Where the issue in the short-term has been and I think most of this is now behind us, has been on natural ingredients and carrot costs.","As you know, we went from a very unique drought situation, and that raised our costs in terms of water costs, water extraction costs, land costs, and then we went from that to four rain events within a 10-day period, which also cost us on the carrot cost side. And both of those situations have impacted our business.","The reason I said I believe it's behind us is now we've shifted our harvesting to the more southern region where they don't have the same kind of situation. We saw improved performance in the back end of our quarter, so we feel pretty good about the outlook.","The other issue, we've had a little bit on the top line, is we export some natural ingredients and concentrates to Japan, and that business has been under pressure. But the core business, the CPG, beverages and salad dressings continues to perform very, very well.","Lubi John Kutua - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. That's helpful. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","If we look at, I guess, gross margins today versus even a couple of years ago, obviously we have seen some pretty significant erosion for various reasons that you have discussed over time. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you view the current level of gross margins as maybe somewhat artificially low or as really a new, more reasonable base from which you try and improve going forward in light of the various reinvestment needs? You've got the gross margin mix of some of the faster growth areas put against the ZBB actions you are going to take.","And then just secondly, you are taking some pricing actions, even in soup you talked about. I had always thought it was tough to take pricing sort of intra soup season. And is it just more on the versions that you know are very inelastic that allow you to do that? Just trying to get a sense of what's changed there. Thank you.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","In terms of the first part of the question, I really believe we have opportunities to improve our gross margin performance over time. And I think when you think about the new organizational structure, coupled with the portfolio role that we've assigned to each of those businesses, we really do have an opportunity to improve gross margin performance, both from net price realization, both from a more modest inflation outlook, continuing productivity improvements, and the cost savings we expect to garner through our new $200 million program. So, I think there are opportunities to expand margin over time.","In terms of the pricing question, I mean, certainly in terms of benefit, we get more benefit by enacting a pricing action ahead of the soup season, but there is nothing that really prevents us from doing it at any point. The key is to work through the timing and the impact on the promotional activity with our retailers, but this was well planned out, and is now in the marketplace.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Good morning, thanks.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Jonathan.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","I guess this is for Anthony. Looking at the volume declines, particularly in Simple Meals over the past few years, and you mentioning your use of increased co-packing in some of the new products, what would you say that maintenance capital expenditure is for this business?","And maybe as part of that, as we look at this new sort of segment structure and maybe some different kind of streamlining and cost savings that might allow, what sort of returns on capital do you typically look at for amounts over and above that maintenance capital expenditure in your annual regular budgeting process? Thanks.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think maybe the best way to answer the question is we expected to spend about $400 million this year on capital. 60% of which is on projects that have an economic return, and those are split between capacity-adding projects and cost-reduction projects.","On the capacity-adding project we typically see pretty significant and attractive IRRs, I'd say 20% plus kind of levels. On the cost-reduction ones, I'd say we do see returns certainly above the cost of capital. It's kind of hard to come up with one kind of IRR for them, they kind of range, but I think we have a very successful track record of achieving good returns on those cost reduction projects.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","I got you, but if your business, just in a weird alternate universe didn't grow volume at all, and everything stayed exactly the same from year to year, you are saying about 40% of your capital expenditure would be required to sort of just \u2013 doesn't have an economic return, just sort of maintains economic returns where they are.

DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I guess maybe I will follow up on Andrew's question around pricing. Is this kind of a signal of, for lack of a better phrase, treating some of the Simple Meals in the new division and maybe the relative share targets? Is one way to interpret this that it is, again kind of lack of a better term, but a cash cow?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not intended to be, Eric. I mean, when you take a step back, the pricing action was only on 25% of our U.S. retail portfolio based on gross sales, but across our entire portfolio, it equates to about 1.4%. And we were very surgical about where we priced, and so it was predominantly on Red & White condensed, on Prego, and on Campbell gravy.","So the other place where we are constantly looking to is where we've spent promotional activity and didn't get the returns on that activity.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't read any more into it than that.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Anthony. I remember there was a lot of confusion in the first quarter about how you account for fixed cost absorption, and I'm kind of asking that question with regard to the second quarter and the gross margin weakness. And kind of these third \u2013 it's not like your volume was really all that bad in the scheme of things. And so I guess were you actually kind of looking for volume in the quarter to be down, and then volume was better than you thought, and then you had to go out into the market to buy the spot freight rates and...? Or was it, again, having to do something with how you account for those fixed costs as you go through the year?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, trying not to complicate this too much, but it's actually a little bit of both, right? The whole area of inventory and inventory management gets really complex when you think about SKU and location and our multiple distribution points and the fact that we got a little bit behind and had to catch up. And that takes a little bit of time in season when you're running pretty close to flat-out inside of these plants. So we had to run a little more overtime. We had to use co-packers more. That's more of a broth idea than a can idea.","Separate from that, in this whole area of fixed costs it's not the major impact but our sales came down a little bit inside our own range, and that had a slight negative impact on fixed cost absorption both in the quarter and in our outlook for the year, but it wasn't a significant impact.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","We have time for one more question.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. Your line is open.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning. And thanks for getting me in. Kind of two points that I just wanted to clear up and then a very short question; the first one is just on the guidance. So, if I understand it right, the previous gross margin guidance was minus 50 to basis points minus 100 basis points. Today you are guiding to down 100 basis points, so at the low end of the previously-discussed guidance on gross margins. Tax rate is lower. So, Anthony, what is the change in the guidance then on EPS? It looks like it's all between gross profits and EBIT, everything in the SG&A line. What's changing there if I've said everything correctly?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Between EBIT and EPS, a couple of changes. One is we took the tax rate down a bit. We also expect interest expense to be favorable to our original assumption, so down slightly year on year. And then within EBIT, I would say there's three things happening. The primary issue is the gross margin performance, and that's a combination of the freight and distribution that we've been talking about. The manufacturing costs that we've been talking about, the use of co-packers. We had a slight impact from an equipment outage at one of our plants and from a stronger U.S. dollar, that impact on the input costs of some of our international businesses.","The second area is currency translation, so we went from about 1 point of negative impact to 2 points and about a nickel impact at EPS now for the year. And the third I mentioned a moment ago, is a slight sales reduction within our range which had some impact on gross margin dollars more so than percentage. So I'd say those are the three primary things above EBIT, and then below EBIT, the tax rate and interest expense.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","But just to be super clear on this, because I think that you still -- I'm not saying it or you're not saying it the same way. Gross margins were previously forecasted down 50 basis points to 100 basis points and today you are saying down 100 basis points, so it's still within the range that you said last call, yet your EPS guidance is down $0.10 to $0.12. It doesn't make sense to me when you say all these factors, because that would be inclusive of what you said three months ago.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I'd say in hand sight that gross margin range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points was probably a bit too wide. And we were closer to the 50 basis points than the 100 basis points.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right, that's what I was looking for. On the service issues, Denise, just a question here to follow-up on what Moskow said earlier. It does seem like all of this is related to just planning issues. So, I mean, intermodal transport, everything just seems to be related to forecasting out what you had to ship in this period of time. And that forecasting doesn't go well and, hence, it causes a domino effect across your supply chain that increases costs. Is that just kind of fundamentally the root cause analysis as to what happened?","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's part of it, David, but literally, having the one less plant in our system, having a much more expensive spot market and making sure that we were \u2013 we got out of the gate with a huge back to school program that put some pressure on our forecast, it was above what we had anticipated. So there was a combination of a lot of things coming together and we got behind. And then we made the conscious decision to make sure that we were delivering for our customers and I still would have made that same decision.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Last little thing for me was just on winter temperatures and soup sales. In our latest 12 weeks of Nielsen retail data, which I think is easier to understand than maybe your shipment patterns this year, the retail data looks pretty soft in soup and yet the winter temperatures have been pretty cold. So, I was just curious if you had a thought as to kind of why that's happening, what's driving the reduction in consumption. Because I think it's both a sales and a volume issue according to our Nielsen data.","Denise M. Morrison - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, our consumption is down about 1%, and it's pretty much in line with center store categories. So...","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's really difficult for us to tease out the temperature and the winter impact from our overall performance.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","And it was cold last year, too.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I just wanted to get your sense of it. Thank you so much.","Jennifer K. Driscoll - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Jennifer K.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call and webcast for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, CFO and Chief Administrative Officer; and Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance; as well as Stephanie Varnum, Senior Manager in Investor Relations.","Denise will kick us off today with a strategic update, a few thoughts on Hurricane Sandy, the highlights of our results for the first quarter and a few comments on the year. Then Craig will offer his take on the quarter, including our segment results and then our guidance. After we take your questions, Denise will make a few closing remarks.","As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. Please keep in mind that this call is open to members of the media who are participating in listen-only mode.","As a reminder, our presentation today includes forward-looking statements, which reflect the company's current expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to Slide 3 in the presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements that we might make.","As you know, Campbell completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms on August 6, 1 week into the quarter. The acquisition is now included in our results, and it drove most of the year-over-year changes in the first quarter. The quarter also includes $10 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition, which are included in our reported results.","In September 27, we announced a $115-million restructuring program designed to improve our U.S. supply chain cost structure. Our first quarter reported results reflect $43 million of costs associated with that restructuring program.","Our remarks today for the balance of our presentation will be on an adjusted basis, including Bolthouse Farms' operating results for 12 of the 13 weeks of the quarter, but excluding the transaction costs and the restructuring charges.","Since our presentation includes non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules, we've provided a reconciliation of the measures to the mostly -- most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation. These slides, along with our earnings release and selected quarterly financials, also can be found on our website and one other place.","One last item. To make it easier for our iPad and iPhone users to follow Campbell, we've made available to you in the Apple App Store and Google Play Market a new app for viewing Campbell news releases, SEC filings and more on smaller screens. You need to have iTunes installed, but the cost is reasonable, 0. Just search for \"Campbell IR.\" We'd love to get your input on your experience with it as we continue to be interested in improving the way we communicate with you.","And with that, now let me turn the call over to Denise.","Denise M. Morrison","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Campbell's first quarter earnings call.","A few months ago, I marked a year as the CEO of this great company. We have committed ourselves to focus forward relentlessly on a new strategic vision that is centered on driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth. Our 3 growth strategies are focused on accelerating the momentum of our existing businesses and extending our platforms into new higher-growth segments and geographies.","We are working diligently to be a more agile and innovative company that is resolutely focused on the consumer, a company that better satisfies the needs of our core baby boomer consumers and is also responsive to new consumer needs, to demographic and generational change, to the increased demand for fresh foods, to the explosion of digital and social media and to the evolving global culture of food. We know we are witnessing major shifts in the drivers of consumer choice. And at Campbell, our rallying cry is \"consumer first.\"","We recently added some wonderful new talent to our senior leadership team. Mike Senackerib was appointed Campbell's first Chief Marketing Officer. Mike will work to build our brand and product equities globally and enhance our marketing capabilities, particularly in the digital space.","We also announced that Luca Mignini will be our new President of International. Luca has deep experience in Asia, Latin America and Europe and will lead the expansion of our international footprint in faster-growing categories and in faster-growing geographies.","We are not yet a different company, but we are thinking very differently about Campbell's future than we did a year ago. In fiscal 2013, we told you that we expect to return to growth in our base business. The addition of Bolthouse Farms will contribute to both our top line and our bottom line growth. And we are acutely aware of the work we must do now to deliver our long-term sales and earnings targets on a sustainable basis.","Before I talk about our results for the first quarter, I would like to make a few comments about Hurricane Sandy. First, to everyone on this call who was affected by the storm or whose family was affected, please know that our thoughts are with you and with all that are working to restore ravaged communities. Our world headquarters in New Jersey and Pepperidge Farm in Connecticut were closed for 2 days. Many of our employees suffered property damage and were displaced due to loss of power. Scores of residents in our local communities still have needs for food, clothing and shelter.","I am very proud of the many Campbell employees who stepped up to volunteer. In addition to making financial contributions to the Red Cross, the New Jersey governor's relief fund and the special United Way Hurricane Fund, we have shipped products to numerous food banks and relief organizations.","During the storm, we supported our customers with extra merchandise and hurricane pallets. Our Pepperidge Farm distributors were in stores 24\/7, replenishing bread and snacks. And we did see a very small benefit in soup during the last few days of October, but it was not material to the quarter. This is not about business. It's about people. And in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, I saw what I have seen many times before, that the special quality of the Campbell Soup Company is its heart.","Turning now to business. This morning, I'll offer my perspective on our progress as we execute our 3 growth strategies: to stabilize and profitably grow North America soup and Simple Meals, expand our international presence and grow faster in healthy beverages and baked snacks.","Our new fiscal year is off to a solid start, and we're encouraged by the progress we've made on advancing our growth strategies. Our U.S. Soup and Simple Meals business delivered solid results, with sales up 3% and operating earnings up 5% as we continued to optimize execution across all of the drivers of consumer demand.","In the quarter, we reduced advertising spending according to the plans we outlined at our analyst meeting in July. Our advertising spending remained at competitive levels as we continued to run our effective \"It's Amazing What Soup Can Do\" campaign for condensed soup and introduced new advertising for Campbell Chunky RTS Soup. That campaign returns Chunky to its NFL roots, with Victor Cruz of the New York Giants demonstrating that Chunky fills you up right.","Ready-to-serve soups, condensed cooking soups and broth all performed well in the quarter. We also successfully executed our previously announced price increase on condensed soup.","It's too early to judge our breakthrough innovation, particularly our Campbell's Go soups and Campbell's Skillet Sauces, but these launches are showing good retail acceptance. This is the start of strategic innovation platforms for Campbell that we will build over time. These products are outcomes of a reengineered innovation process to accelerate our speed to market. They feature contemporary packaging and offer new global tastes aimed at attracting new consumers or serving new occasions.","As I've stated before, customers have been very supportive of these new products and the many innovations in our base business. We introduced more than 50 new products this year in U.S. Soup and Simple Meals, up from 3 just 3 years ago. While we continue to make important strides in U.S. Soup and Simple Meals, we are not breaking out the champagne yet. We are encouraged, but we have more work to do on this large and important business.","Bolthouse Farms had a very good quarter, with growth in all 3 of its categories: beverages, salad dressings and carrots. The new beverage products introduced last spring, including Coffee Protein PLUS, Orange and Carrot and fresh nog -- yes, without the egg -- are all achieving distribution targets. As we stated, we are operating Bolthouse Farms as a separate business unit, and our integration of corporate services such as finance and legal is on track.","Pepperidge Farm had positive sales in the crackers business, driven by Goldfish and new Jingos!, partly offset by declines in cookies and bakery. We did have a strong October, with solid plans going forward for the holidays. Be on the lookout for Goldfish Finn and Friends in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.","Our business in Asia Pacific returned to growth this quarter, with Australia stabilizing and Indonesia posting double-digit sales gains. In Australia, a refocus on core brands and better joint business plans with our customers have helped results despite a challenging retail and consumer environment. In international, we continued to enjoy momentum in emerging markets, with sales gains in Malaysia and Mexico.","Parts of our business continued to present challenges in quarter one. U.S. Beverage sales declined 5%. Despite easing inflation, we did not return to EBIT growth. We are rebalancing our consumer marketing towards the base V8 Red and V8 V-Fusion business, introducing new advertising and prioritizing our innovation on the highest-potential product platforms: energy and kids juice boxes. We do have positive momentum on V8 Splash.","In North America Foodservice, our retail fresh soups grew while our traditional foodservice business did not. In addition, Europe had subpar performance, albeit in a difficult environment.","Notwithstanding some challenges, overall, our quarter one results have enabled us to reaffirm our annual guidance of net sales growth, plus 10% to 12%; adjusted EBIT growth, plus 4% to 6%; and adjusted EPS growth, plus 3% to 5%. As we've stated before, we anticipate returning to positive organic growth on the base business but expect to be below our long-term targets this year.","Now I'll turn it over to Craig for a discussion of our segment results.","B. Craig Owens","Thanks, Denise. Good morning, everybody.","I'll spend a few minutes discussing our first quarter results and segment highlights, followed by comments on our full year sales and earnings guidance. As Jennifer referenced, my discussion results will exclude the impact of the restructuring charge, as well as transaction costs associated with the Bolthouse Farms acquisition.","So for the quarter, we reported net sales of $2.3 billion, an 8% increase from the first quarter of 2012. Excluding the impact of currency and the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, organic net sales increased by 1% in the quarter. Excluding restructuring costs and acquisition transaction costs, adjusted EBIT increased 5% to $438 million. Of the adjusted EBIT increase, 3 points came from adding Bolthouse and 2 points came from growth in the base business, primarily driven by U.S. Simple Meals. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.88 this quarter, a 7% increase from the first quarter of 2012.","On Slide 22, you see the Bolthouse Farms -- you see that Bolthouse Farms contributed 8 points to sales growth, while currency subtracted 1 point due to the euro weakening against the U.S. dollar. Organic sales increased 1% as pricing contributed 2 points and promotional spending subtracted 1 point. The pricing gains reflected increases on condensed soup in the U.S. and across our baking and snacking segment. The promotional spending variance was primarily related to Global Baking and Snacking. We continued to invest to remain competitive in our Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm businesses.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 160 basis points to 37.9% from 39.5%. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, which operates at a lower gross margin structure. The inflation rate in cost of goods sold was approximately 4%, which is in line with our expectation for the full year.","Marketing and selling expenses decreased 3% to $254 million. Advertising and consumer promotion expense declined by 15%. The primary cause of the declines was our planned reduction in advertising and consumer promotion expenses in the U.S. Soup business, partly offset by the impact of adding Bolthouse Farms. Although U.S. Soup advertising and consumer promotion expenses declined compared with the prior year, we are maintaining competitive levels of support on the base business while investing behind our new launches.","Administrative expenses for the quarter increased by $17 million due to adding Bolthouse and incurring higher compensation and benefit cost, including the expected increases in pension expense.","Below the operating earning lines, net interest expense increased 18% or $5 million. The increase was due to a higher level of debt to fund the acquisition of Bolthouse, partly offset by lower rates on the debt portfolio. The adjusted tax rate declined by 60 basis points to 31.6% from 32.2% in the prior year, due to the favorable settlement of a U.S. state tax matter. With the lower tax rate offsetting increased interest expense, adjusted net earnings increased 5% this quarter. Adjusted earnings per share benefited from fewer shares outstanding and grew by 7%.","First quarter segment sales and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on the next slide. Sales of U.S. Simple Meals increased by 3%, with gains in both U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. U.S. Soup sales rose 2%, driven by gains in broth and ready-to-serve soup, partially offset by a decline in condensed soup. U.S. Sauce sales grew 4%, primarily driven by strong gains in Prego pasta sauce, the launch of Campbell's Skillet Sauces and the growth of Mexican -- of Pace Mexican sauce. These gains were partly offset by lower sales of gravy.","Global Baking and Snacking sales increased by 1%, fueled by gains in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's. Pepperidge Farm sales increased on the strength of another solid quarter of growth in Goldfish snack crackers and by the launch of Jingos! Pepperidge had sales declines in cookies and bakery. Sales in Arnott's increased primarily due to double-digit gains in Indonesia. Biscuit sales in Australia were comparable to the prior year.","Organic sales for International Simple Meals and Beverages increased by 2%. Higher sales in the Asia Pacific region, Latin America and Canada were partially offset by declines in Europe. In Canada, higher selling prices contributed to sales growth; and in Europe, lower sales in Germany were partially offset by higher sales in France. In Asia Pacific, sales increased due to the strong growth in Japan and Malaysia.","Our Bolthouse Farms and foodservice reporting segment now includes the recently acquired Bolthouse business, along with North American Foodservice, which had been recorded separately. Of the segment's $323 million in sales for the quarter, Bolthouse contributed $171 million. Organic sales, excluding the acquisition and currency impact, declined by 6%. This decrease in North American Foodservice sales was primarily due to declines in frozen and canned soup sales, partially offset by volume-driven gains in fresh chilled soups sold at retail.","U.S. Beverages sales decreased by 5% in the quarter. The decrease was due to declines in V8 vegetable juice and V8 V-Fusion beverages, partially offset by an increase in V8 Splash. The decrease in V8 Fusion -- V8 V-Fusion was primarily due to declines in the existing base business, partially offset by growth in new products, including energy drinks and juice boxes.","Operating earnings for Simple Meals rose by 5% to $274 million this quarter. The increase reflects earnings gains in U.S. Soup, partly offset by a decline in U.S. Sauce. Within the segment, the benefits from productivity improvements; higher selling prices, net of related volume impacts; and lower marketing expense were partly offset by cost inflation.","Earnings of Global Baking and Snacking declined by 3%, reflecting lower earnings in both Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm. Both businesses were negatively impacted by increased promotional spending as we continue to invest in highly competitive markets.","Within International Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings increased by 9%, largely driven by growth in Asia Pacific and Canada. Earnings in Europe declined. For the segment, the increase in operating earnings was primarily driven by organic sales gains and an increase in gross margin percentage.","Operating earnings within the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment increased by 26% or $7 million. The increase included $14 million from the addition of Bolthouse Farms and a decrease in earnings from North American Foodservice. Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages were comparable to the prior year, as the impact of lower volume was offset by lower advertising and consumer promotion expense.","U.S. Soup sales for the quarter increased by 2%. Consumer takeaway in the quarter was down about 1%. Ready-to-serve soups and broth sales benefited from movements in customer inventory levels, reflecting accelerated merchandising activity for the quarter. Sales of condensed soup declined by 1% as declines in eating varieties were only partly offset by gains in cooking varieties. Our pricing in response to inflation in condensed soup has not resulted in any unexpected volume pressure.","RTS soup sales increased by 4%. Volume-driven gains in Campbell's Chunky canned soups were partially offset by declines in microwavable soups. Campbell's Go soups, launched this quarter, added to the sales growth. Broth sales grew 9%, primarily due to volume-driven gains in both aseptically packaged and canned broths.","Slide 29 is a look at U.S. retail sales of wet soup for the last 52 weeks based on SymphonyIRI multi-outlet data. The U.S. wet soup category rose by 0.5% in the last 52 weeks. Campbell soup sales for the same period declined 2.7%. This performance compares with a gain of 8.4% for other branded players and flat results for private label.","Campbell maintained a strong leadership position with a market share of 58.7% for the year. Private label players held their share, while other branded players gained share.","Cash flow from operations was $81 million compared with $73 million in the prior year period. Capital expenditures of $41 million were up from $35 million a year ago. For the year, we continue to forecast capital spending of approximately $333 million, including spending at Bolthouse Farms.","As we've previously announced, we suspended the strategic share repurchase program so that we can use our cash flow to reduce the debt we incurred to finance the Bolthouse acquisition. However, we continue to repurchase sufficient shares to offset dilution from equity compensation programs. Net debt rose to $4.1 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion due to the acquisition.","This morning, we confirmed our fiscal 2013 guidance. I'd like to point out that as we look at the progression of the year, we believe that the second quarter profitability could be negatively impacted by the fact that we are exiting the first quarter with high soup inventories due to strong holiday sell-in; and by a planned increase in marketing support for new products, notably Campbell's Go soup and Campbell's Skillet Sauces. As a result, EPS for the second quarter is likely to lag our full year guidance growth rate.","We continue to expect to grow sales for the year between 10% and 12%, with adjusted EBIT growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 3% to 5%. Within these ranges, currency is expected to be neutral to slightly negative. We expect interest expense to increase approximately $30 million, primarily due to the acquisition financing, and the tax rate to be between 31% and 32%.","As we mentioned, we completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms this quarter and financed the purchase with debt. Our guidance includes the estimated impact of the Bolthouse business and excludes the impact of onetime acquisition transaction costs and also the cost associated with our recently announced restructuring program. We expect the acquisition to contribute approximately $750 million to sales and to add $0.05 to $0.07 to our adjusted EPS, including the impact of suspending our strategic share repurchases.","Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jennifer now.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thank you, Craig. At this time, we will conduct a Q&A session. We'd like to request that callers limit themselves to one question apiece, but stay on the line in case clarifications are needed. This way, we hope to respond to more callers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to drill down a little bit on some of the commentary, Craig, around the inventory -- or the accelerated inventory levels. Just want to be clear, was that, I guess, part of the plan in your first quarter, obviously, to ship in a little more aggressively maybe than last year such that you're ready to go for your merchandising plans? And I guess if we were to think about the fiscal first half as opposed to just the first quarter versus the second, how should we think about your expectation for soup sales maybe on that kind of a basis?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. I think you're hitting it right, Andrew, by focusing on the first half. The acceleration in inventory coming out of the quarter was due to our holiday sell-in for November and December. Some retailers shipped earlier this year than last year. We're encouraged, though, by the strong merchandising plans that we have, and it's also been rotated amongst different brands. So coming into the quarter, we had a higher level of inventory. We maintained that. And so coming out of the quarter, we're still at those levels. So we just wanted to manage people's expectations for the half.","B. Craig Owens","Part of it, Andrew, is just the calendar, right? We have an earlier Thanksgiving this year, and so I think retailers have just been a little bit ahead of the curve and maybe a little bit of the storm impact, too, which fell right at the end of the quarter.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Is your hope that, through the first half, that we'd see soup sales in positive territory? Or is it just still -- I mean, the second quarter is obviously huge from that perspective from a takeaway standpoint.","B. Craig Owens","Right. We don't forecast, as you know, soup sales separately, but we're happy with the start that we're off to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Aaron with RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I wanted to ask about the A&C spending in the quarter. I guess I didn't fully appreciate how much it might be down in Q1. Can you tell us if that was fully planned? And then as kind of a broader follow-up question to that, some food companies are starting to talk about shifting A&C spending back above the line just to kind of manage price points lower, just given the consumer environment. And I'm wondering if that's a dynamic that you're expecting on some level to happen with your business as well over the next few quarters.","Denise M. Morrison","It's true; our quarter one A&C expense declined by 15%, primarily due to reduced spending on U.S. Soup and partially offset by an increase of support for new innovations. It is in the range of the plans for the full year, and we did move some money into increased promotion, particularly in the bakery and the baked snacks business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So lots of potential questions here. Let me focus on the fresh baking business, where -- which I think you said was still challenged this quarter. It's -- the industry here in the U.S. is in a state of flux, with one of your competitors having now suspended production and distribution. How do you think about that scenario and what the implications may be for your business going forward?","Denise M. Morrison","Right now, we are seeing, in the latest 2 months, some pressure, and we're getting industry reports on that. The parts of the business that are more robust are the casual dining, health care and education. But overall, we're not pleased with the performance of our foodservice business this quarter. Oh, I'm sorry. I heard you -- Jason, did you say foodservice or...","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Specifically, I'm asking fresh bakery implications of Hostess.","Jennifer Driscoll","Oh, for TreeHouse?","B. Craig Owens","Hostess.","Denise M. Morrison","For Hostess. The bakery business? I'm sorry.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, No worries.","Denise M. Morrison","Okay. Well, I answered another question that you might have had.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. It's like a 2-for-1 special.","Denise M. Morrison","Okay, there you go. We're monitoring the Hostess situation. We -- and of course, our manufacturing supply chain and distributors are standing ready to ensure that customers aren't at risk for any supply interruptions caused by this. This is a business that is continuously changing through consolidation and price discounting. And we just feel that we're well positioned to play in this, in the part of the business that we occupy right now, which is more the upper end.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one more if I could sneak it in. Bolthouse, I know it's still young as part of your portfolio, but it's got a unique distribution platform. Denise, can you talk to us, whether it be broad strokes, or hopefully as much specificity as possible, in terms of your innovation plans and how you intend to leverage that?","Denise M. Morrison","Right now, it's early days, but we're very pleased with the performance in all 3 categories of Bolthouse. And some of that growth has been driven by new innovation, particularly in the beverage business, but also increase in distribution in the salad dressing business.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I wanted to ask a little bit more about condensed soup, and I wasn't sure if your inventory comments were more focused on one side or the other. But on condensed soup, you had in the fourth quarter, I think it was -- the fourth quarter is -- it's always hard to interpret some of these quarters because they're not the same in terms of total volumes. But it was like a 10% or double-digit growth in volumes last quarter. And now, this quarter, sales are down 1%. I don't know the volumes, but is this what you're trying to lead us to, where the inventories are just coming in a little bit full right now going into Q2?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So, David, we've actually seen a little bit of a rotation. You're exactly right. As we came out of the fourth quarter, our condensed inventories were a little bit higher than normal. The good news there is that we saw good sell-through on the back-to-school and other promotional activity that had created those higher inventories. And now as we've come more into the run-up to the holiday season coming out of the first quarter, the higher inventory levels are really driven more by RTS. So you've had the rotation of inventory. It's not the same inventory. It's not even around the same product line. And you've got -- consequently, you've got a little bit of a mix shift issue as we've rotated out of condensed and into RTS. But it's -- I think, overall, you can think about soup inventories continuing to be a little bit higher than normal as we come out of the quarter, but it's more RTS and broth than it is condensed.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And one quick follow-up on some of your Bolthouse comments. Was the profit contribution in the quarter kind of below normal? I.e., was purchase accounting a factor here on the inventories? I've had a few questions from people on that this morning.","B. Craig Owens","So yes, purchase accounting, it is going to be an issue, and you're right to point the inventories on the first year will run off the write-up of the purchase accounting impact on inventory. Also, remember that we had one less week of Bolthouse in this first quarter than we did for the total company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I just ask you to maybe elaborate a little bit on the weakness in the beverage segment? You mentioned slackening consumer demand. I was a little surprised that, that might be kicking in now rather than maybe earlier in the economic downturn. Is it something to do with pricing versus other juices? Or can you tell us a little bit more about what's going on there?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. The beverage category, particularly the shelf-stable juice category, has been under pressure for quite some time now. And we continue to observe behavior that consumers are trading down, particularly in the -- from the 100% juice businesses that we're in. There has been some competition that's been very price aggressive that has negatively affected our V8 vegetable juice and V8 V-Fusion; however, our V8 Splash continues to perform very well. And our new item innovations are continuing to contribute to sales growth, but they haven't been sufficient enough to overcome the category weaknesses or the aggressive price pressures. So what we're going to do about it is we're shoring up the core business with line extensions on V8 and improved taste. We're also playing in value by pushing V8 Splash, and then we're innovating in high-growth segments such as energy and kids. And we think that a combination of easing inflation and productivity improvements will help us with improved EBIT for the year. So that's how we're looking at it at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Denise, I just wanted to try and get some insight into how you're thinking about the promotional support you're putting behind soup during the soup season. And if we look at the measured channel data for ready-to-serve, it looks like pricing is down year-on-year in ready-to-serve in recent periods, and that we -- so that's driven a fairly pronounced increase in volumes more recently. Is that consistent with what you're seeing in your business? And is this any indication of a change in the way you're thinking about the optimal balance between innovation-driven growth and promotion over the next few months?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, we're -- again, we're optimizing all of the drivers of demand. And in addition to product and packaging, there is a merchandising factor, and we're looking at each brand, given its competitive set. So in the first quarter, we were very aggressive in promoting, particularly, our Chunky brand. As we repositioned it, we improved the label on the brand to emphasize the delicious food and the soup that eats like a meal. We went to the NFL with Victor Cruz, and so we did put some support behind that brand to get some momentum.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And would you say that was more an issue of sort of the timing of your merchandising plans? Or is that a strategy that might persist through the second quarter?","Denise M. Morrison","Well, I think you can plan on seeing aggressive merchandising plans.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer of UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just building on that last question. In ready-to-serve, it looked like you had a good last month. The promotions were up. Select Harvest repositioned 100% Naturals. How is that working specifically? And then is it too early to tell how the new messaging around -- the low-fat, high-protein messaging and the NFL, is that gaining traction on the Chunky portfolio? Any sense there?","Denise M. Morrison","The performance of RTS this quarter really was because of brand Chunky. And the 100% Natural soup is flowing through to the shelf and has been down versus year ago. And we'll continue to put the adequate support on that business as well because it is an important business to us. It's too soon to tell on some of the new products, but some of the new products that we introduced last year like Slow Kettle, Slow Kettle's consumption and share are both up in the quarter and our new Flavor Boost product was down in the quarter. However, we are flowing through a new pack, which we shifted from an 8-pack to a 4-pack and reduced the price to $2 to increase the trial, because our repeat is very good on this product. So we did learn a lot last year from the introduction of that product.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is the light soup area -- is that something that you think will stabilize as the fiscal year progresses? I mean clearly, where I'm getting at is that, that portfolio has been repositioned a couple times, and I'm wondering if you're a little bit more optimistic about this go-around.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, it's still -- I mean, it's still a smaller part of our portfolio, and we did -- we are now emphasizing the 100% Natural, and it really will be up to the consumer to decide.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 quick questions for you. The first one, I guess for you, Denise, would be just in relation to Global Baking and Snacking, to understand the growth of the U.S. business versus the international business, I guess to understand how Arnott's in Australia is performing versus, say, Pepperidge in the U.S.","Denise M. Morrison","Well, Pepperidge in the U.S. grew, but it was growing because of the cracker business. Goldfish and Jingos! were up high single digits, and it offset some declines in our cookie business and in our bakery business. But we have seen better momentum in October and going into the holidays. In Arnott's, the situation is they're still competing in a difficult market. We've seen improvements in the business, we are continuing to gain share there, so we are feeling better about Australia this year in the biscuit business.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up, maybe for Craig. In relation to Bolthouse, is there -- I'm just trying to think about the seasonality of the business. Are there -- and to make sure I have this modeled properly going forward, there's a little more profit this quarter than I thought, is what it comes down to. Is that a function of this quarter? Is there a seasonality factor to consider, is the question.","B. Craig Owens","There's a little bit of seasonality. You didn't see it so much in this quarter because, again, we had one less week in the quarter than we do in the full year. The seasonality comes from the carrot business being a little bit heavier in the second quarter. That's partially offset by the fact that beverages are a little bit stronger in the summer. So the business overall is less seasonal than Campbell's business, so it won't have a material impact on the total company seasonality.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess 2 questions. One is I was kind of surprised -- and I guess we touched on it a little bit, but I'm kind of surprised that the margins in U.S. Simple Meals were slightly over 30%. I don't remember the last time the margins were that high in the segment, although I guess it's changed a little bit over time. But is -- like, obviously, the lower advertising versus the higher inventory, I guess, is partly explaining it. But I'm kind of wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail. Is there the timing of inflation versus the restructuring action you took? I just -- I'm trying to get a better sense to what's making those margins so high this quarter.","B. Craig Owens","So the restructuring action wouldn't have any impact in the quarter. I think the primary thing that you're probably seeing versus prior quarter is the reduced advertising and consumer promotional expense, Eric.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Yes, I would just add, there's a pretty significant seasonality to the profitability of the Simple Meals segment. It ranges from 30 to as low as 20 in the other quarters.","B. Craig Owens","So this is not typical...","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Even year-over-year, but, I mean, it's been a while since we've hit over 30 in that segment.","B. Craig Owens","It looks like it's only up about 1 point from the prior year.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Okay. And then I guess, on the Go soup product, Denise, are you sensing any push back on the price point? Because, I guess, we've seen some commentary that, that might be a price point that's a little difficult for Millennials at the moment. Is there any initial sense of that at the trade level?","Denise M. Morrison","No, we have not gotten any feedback on that, and we recognize that the price is more premium than some of our other offerings. But so far -- again, it's early days. The repeat on this item is pretty robust. So it's all about getting consumer trial over the next several quarters, but we haven't heard any push back on pricing.","B. Craig Owens","Most of the ACB [ph] is now at $2.99, which we feel is a pretty good price point for that product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So I guess I wanted to just think about -- I mean, on the advertising, the total A&C spending, particularly behind soup, I guess I'm -- can you give us a sort of long-term target where you think that ought to work out for a business of this margin structure?","Denise M. Morrison","We -- our long-term target and our short-term target right now is to be fully competitive, and we're basing that on a variety of benchmarks, such as a percent of sales and share of voice, to name 2. We think that it's really important for these brands to think about all of the drivers of demand and make sure that we are putting our spending where we're going to get the maximum impact, and that could vary by brand and even by segment. So I cited the Chunky example earlier and that seems to be working.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. If I could just follow up, Denise, the -- then -- yes, I guess competitive is -- when you say competitive, I guess, are you thinking inside the soup category? Because I mean, I guess one of the -- how are you framing that, because when I look at -- it seems to me a lot of the potential -- the slowdown -- a potential explanation for the slowdown of the soup category, period, is that its leader hasn't spent enough on advertising the past 3 or 4 years, and so you might be keeping up with the competition but the category as a whole maybe has suffered. And I think the innovation helps, but are you -- when you say competitive, are you talking about competitive within soup or competitive broadly with spending rates in other categories as you see them?","Denise M. Morrison","Well, in the case of soup, we look at both within soup and also within the broader context of the 30-plus categories that we track in Simple Meals. And quite frankly, in the U.S. Soup business, we did lower our advertising. But in our other businesses, our advertising either stayed the same or increased.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Denise, just now that you're 5 quarters into this, and with all of the effort that's been put into Simple Meals and soup in particular, do you have a sense at this point whether you've changed -- there's been any change or been able to kind of move the change in consumer habits at home? I think as we kind of went into this over a year ago, it's one thing to be able to sort of merchandise and get people to pull it off the shelf, but the more important thing is to really get people to actually consume the products at home. And I understand it's a little bit early, especially with all the new products that have come out. But how do you feel about movement that you've made or progress that you've made in that regard in terms of just getting people to actually go home and use the products?","Denise M. Morrison","Well, I think it's early days on the new products to declare victory there. I do think that the new products are helping to create somewhat of a buzz about soup in general, which is important, because people don't think about it as often as they should, and so that reminding them is important. But I think we've done a good job in terms of executing at Campbell's to put some new experiences out to the market for the consumer to enjoy and, particularly, younger consumers to attract them into the category. We're going to continue to build on those platforms. This is not going to be a 1-year wonder. So I think these are still early days, but I really do believe we're on the right course here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the signal that you're sending perhaps to retailers by perhaps cutting marketing spending on your core soups a little bit? And the reason I'm asking is there has been some conversation lately about perhaps some of your larger retailers reconsidering whether it's a great use of space to use gravity feed shelves or not. And I'm just wondering, when I talk to retailers and they think about soup, whether the manufacturers are really committed to the can, whether that's something that they should be committed to as well. So can you just talk a little bit about the balance between how you think about that and maybe spending more on marketing to allay their fears or continue to drive down the spending to help your margins a bit?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, I can. First of all, in terms of the shelving, we actually have iQ Maximizers in greater than 25,000 stores. And that seems to be servicing the consumer very well in terms of making it easier to shop, and from an operations standpoint, it's holding up to the retailers' standards. So I'm not sure what the link is for shelf space that you're talking about, but we have not seen an impact on shelf space at this point. In fact, with the new products that we're introducing, we're having conversations to make sure that we are accommodating all of our products on the shelf and continuing to bring the retailers new and exciting things to increase their center store sales. The second part of your question, on cutting marketing, we had increases in advertising and consumer in all of our categories with the exception of soup, and we have not cut our total marketing. We had expenses in advertising and consumer decline, but we are spending against these products in a very competitive way. And we were -- we're explaining that to retailers and we're getting support.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then one quick follow-up on David Driscoll's question about Bolthouse and Foodservice margins. Should we expect a similar decline year-on-year in that segment's margin going forward then?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So Bolthouse operates structurally at a significantly lower margin rate than the rest of the company. I think the first quarter margin structure is probably pretty reflective of the full year for that segment now, right?","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So somewhere around 10.5% is not unreasonable.","B. Craig Owens","Yes, I think that's probably about right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","When I look at your -- at the breakdown of the soup sales, so it's condensed down, but ready-to-serve being up 4%, and I compare that with scanner data, scanner data looks much different, I think, in -- at least in ready-to-serve. Why would I not think that this difference between scanner data and the data that you showed today is just driven by the channel fill and the sell-through -- channel fill within your products and the sell-through just isn't there yet?","B. Craig Owens","Well -- so, Thilo, I think we did say that we're exiting the quarter with higher inventories, and that there has been some rotation in those inventories toward ready-to-serve. So I mean, I think you're right. We saw heavier sales of both broth and ready-to-serve in the quarter than we saw consumption, and it's largely associated with selling in ahead of the holiday and merchandising activity that's scheduled out over the first few weeks of November here. So I think your reading is approximately right.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But is it selling across the entire portfolio on ready-to-serve? Or is it focused on the new product?","B. Craig Owens","Well, clearly, you've got some pipeline fill on the new product, but it's not just new product. In fact, it's probably heaviest in broth, which as you can imagine is a big holiday item. So it's broth, it's ready-to-serve and it's the new products.","Denise M. Morrison","Right. And we've also had new innovations on our base business too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Moscow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just was looking at the U.S. Beverages segment, and it looks like sales will end up being flat pretty much to where they were in 2010. So there really hasn't been any growth in this segment and profits are way down. Can you give us a sense within that mix? I understand the strategy is to extend into more single-serve items and maybe away from core V8 Red. Can you give us a sense of what's happened to like the core V8 Red during this time, whether new products are now a bigger part of the pie? And then secondly, I thought I heard that there might have to be a wait out on V8 Red during the course of this year to compensate for higher commodity costs. And are you concerned that this would hurt volume further on the core business?","Denise M. Morrison","No, I am not -- I don't know where you heard that there'll be a wait out on V8 Red. Right now, our plan on V8 Red, and we do believe that we need to call more attention to it, is to improve the taste on the original V8 Red, to celebrate the taste in our advertising, and we have Hint of Lime and Black Pepper flavor extensions to create some news for that 100% juice offering. And we are refocusing on our base 100% juice while we also push V8 Splash, which has done very well. But the entire category has been pretty soft for a number of quarters now.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Denise, do you mean the entire vegetable juice-based category? Or do you mean...","Denise M. Morrison","No, no, no. No, the entire shelf-stable juice category, particularly in the 100% juice segment.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. What about noncarbonated beverages in general? Like I always thought that, that was a faster growing segment of overall beverages. Do you look at yourself in that context also?","Denise M. Morrison","We do, and that's where we have the insights around new innovation. For example, the energy and the kids segments are growing faster.","Operator","Our next question comes from Diane Geissler with Credit Agricole Securities.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I may have missed this, but did you quantify the value of the buy-in ahead of the early holiday?","Denise M. Morrison","No, you didn't miss it.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, I know Andrew had asked about sort of first half over first half, and you have guided down the second quarter, so any color that you can give us to give us an idea about what the magnitude was?","B. Craig Owens","The only thing...","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Was it an extra week of inventory, 2 weeks of inventory? Was it all across your entire product line?","B. Craig Owens","Yes, I think the best way to think about it is to look at consumption versus sales, right, Diane? So consumption was down 1%; sales were up. Without forecasting the soup sales, or particularly without forecasting them by quarter, I think that's the best way to sort of keep tabs on where we are in sell-in versus consumption.","Denise M. Morrison","And the sell-in against the holiday season, of course, the consumption happens in another quarter. So the good news is that we're getting good merchandising support, but I do think you have to look at it on a season basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My first question is just regarding the U.S. consumer overall. You have a pretty big footprint in the center of the store, and some other companies recently have said they've seen the consumer shift back into the center of the store a little bit more recently. Have you seen that? I mean, are you seeing consumption sort of increase for food categories in the center of the store?","Denise M. Morrison","We track the Simple Meals category. In over 52 weeks, the consumption's been up over 2%, and in the last 13, it's been a little bit over 1%, so it's still trailing 52 weeks.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on marketing. You made a -- you hired somebody to lead your marketing division. I was just wanting to get your perspective on what this particular person adds that you didn't have per se before in your organization, and how sort of links to the future sort of demand trends that you see longer term.","Denise M. Morrison","We have a center of excellence that works on our advertising and design, our marketing excellence, which is training for our people to make sure we're building skills. Obviously, with the transition of connecting with consumers through the digital space, that's going to require some real focus and expertise, and then being a support system for the brand management in the business unit so that there is a continuing to build on the standards of excellence for driving a growth agenda. So we believe he'll be a really good addition in terms of focusing us there.","Okay. So I guess we're coming up on the hour. I apologize to any of you that we didn't get to, but we're going to move to our wrap-up.","So in conclusion, we'd like to leave you with some key points from today's call. Our new fiscal year is off to a solid start, and Campbell is becoming more agile, more innovative and more focused on the consumer. We've recruited some wonderful new talent in marketing and in international. We've posted encouraging gains in U.S. Soup and Simple Meals as we continue to optimize all the drivers of consumer demands across our key brands. And while it's too early to judge our breakthrough innovations, we firmly believe that our reengineered innovation process enhances our ability to attract new consumers and serve new occasions.","Our first quarter with Bolthouse Farms was strong and the integration is on track. Challenges do remain in our U.S. Beverage business, but we are course correcting and expect more of a recovery in the coming quarters.","Overall, we're able to reiterate our annual guidance for the year of sales growth of 10% to 12%; adjusted EBIT, growth 4% to 6%; and adjusted EPS growth of 3% to 5%. But I want to make sure that my message to you is clear, we are encouraged but not satisfied. We know what we have to do and what our opportunities are, and we're clearly making progress but we're not there yet.","Hurricane Sandy reminded us that we have a lot to be thankful for here at Campbell. Among many other things, we're thankful to have leading brands to compete with; strong margins; amazing cash flow; and above all, talented and dedicated employees with a lot of heart. So we wish you and yours a very Happy Thanksgiving. And with that, Jennifer, please provide the closing reminders.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thank you very much. We appreciate you listening to the call today. We will have replays available. And if we didn't get to you, please give me a call at (856) 342-6081.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jennifer K. Driscoll","Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, CFO and Chief Administrative Officer; Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations.","Denise will kick us off today with her perspective on the third quarter. Craig will then give you the financial and segment results for the quarter, our 9-month highlights and expectations for fiscal 2013. After that, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com and on our IR app, which is available through Google or Apple. Please keep in mind that this call is open to members of the media who are participating in listen-only mode.","As a reminder, our presentation today includes forward-looking statements, which reflect the company's current expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to Slide 2 in the presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K -- I'm sorry, Slide 3, and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements.","Campbell completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms 1 week into this current fiscal year. The acquisition is now included in our results, and it drove most of the year-over-year changes in our first 5 -- 9 months. In September, we announced a restructuring program designed to improve our U.S. supply chain cost structure. Our third quarter reported results reflect $20 million pretax of costs associated with that program. Last, we signed commercial agreements with 2 companies in Mexico in February, and our third quarter reported results reflect $1 million of associated pretax costs related to those agreements.","Our remarks today for the balance of our presentation will be on an adjusted basis, including Bolthouse Farms' operating results for 38 of the 39 weeks, but excluding its transaction costs and the restructuring charges.","Since our presentation includes non-GAAP measures, as defined by SEC rules, we've provided a reconciliation of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation. These slides, along with our earnings release and selected quarterly financials, also can be found on our website accessible online or on your mobile device with the Campbell IR app.","I've got one more thing to plug. We'd like to cordially invite our analysts to our annual Analyst Day at Campbell World Headquarters. This year's event will be held on the morning of Wednesday, July 24, and will feature presentations by Denise Morrison, Craig Owens and several other Campbell leaders. It will also be your opportunity to meet 2 of them who are new, including Luca Mignini, our new President of Campbell International; and Jeff Dunn, Head of Bolthouse Farms.","After the formal remarks that day, we'll offer Q&A before concluding our Analyst Day with a very tasty luncheon, featuring Campbell and Bolthouse products. We hope you'll join us either via webcast, or better yet, live at World Headquarters here in Camden, New Jersey. Watch for more information later.","And with that, let me turn it over to Denise.","Denise M. Morrison","Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As you've seen in our earnings release this morning, we are very pleased by our results for the third quarter. Our net sales were up 15% or 4% excluding the impact of Bolthouse Farms, which we acquired in the first quarter of the year. Our adjusted EBIT was up 9% or 3% excluding the acquisition. Our adjusted EPS was up 11%. These results were driven by outstanding sales and profit gains in U.S. Simple Meals, led by our U.S. Soup business whose sales were up 14%. There were also strong contributions from Bolthouse Farms and solid sales performance in Global Baking and Snacking, including both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's.","As you've also seen, we revised our previous guidance for the full year. We now expect to end the fiscal year with both net sales and adjusted EBIT at the high end of the growth ranges we previously forecasted for the year and adjusted EPS above our previous guidance.","In my comments this morning, I'll offer my perspective on the performance of our Soup business in the quarter and comment on the progress of our innovation program in U.S. Simple Meals. I also want to talk about our plans for improving the performance of 2 businesses that did not do well in quarter 3: U.S. Beverages and North America Foodservice. I'll say a few words about Global Baking and Snacking and Bolthouse Farms. Finally, I'll offer some thoughts on how our results for the third quarter relate to our overarching strategy for the business. Craig will then provide a more detailed review of our third quarter financials, and then we'll open up the call for your questions.","So first, U.S. Soup. Our U.S. Soup business delivered exceptionally strong third quarter performance. Condensed sales increased 11%, sales of our ready-to-serve soups increased 18% and sales in the broth business also rose 18%. Overall, the top line in U.S. Soup grew by 14% for the quarter. These are clearly impressive results.","For the most part, we delivered these results by doing what we said we would do in our Soup business, focusing relentlessly on improving our execution against the drivers of demand. We've improved product quality and packaging. We have more effective advertising and consumer promotion and better in-store merchandising. Our new product varieties have been well received by consumers. Our price realization has continued to work. Our Chunky soup franchise posted strong double-digit growth in the third quarter behind a number of brand-building initiatives, including increased promotional spending, introduction of new varieties, improvement in quality and a return to more impactful NFL-themed advertising. Overall, we have maintained competitive levels of advertising while reducing less productive spending and supporting new product innovation.","There's little doubt that we had some help from the weather in the third quarter and for the soup season, although it's hard to quantify the impact of that factor with any precision. Colder weather clearly helped Soup sales in the quarter as we cycled last year's weather, which was one of the warmest winters on record. We also delivered stronger execution and laid the groundwork for sustainable growth.","We are very encouraged by the progress we've made in this business. Year-to-date, both Campbell Soups and the wet soup category in the United States have grown 4%. We are confident that we can now drop the word \"stabilize\" in our strategy and focus on driving sustainable, profitable growth in North America Soup and Simple Meals.","While I'm on the subject of U.S. Simple Meals, I'd like to comment on our progress in innovation. As I just mentioned, strong sustaining innovation has had a positive impact on the performance of our Simple Meals portfolio. Appealing new product varieties and a resolute focus on improved quality are helping us reinforce and expand the vitality of our brands with our loyal consumer base. But as you know, we're also working hard to expand our core franchise in North America to reach new consumer groups and a new generation of consumers.","In combination, Campbell's Go soups and Campbell's Skillet Sauces added approximately 1 point of growth for U.S. Simple Meals, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. While sales are still small, we're committed to these products and are pleased by the potential they've shown. Let me explain. Premium shelf-stable soup is a fast-growing segment of the Soup category, with higher retail price points and primarily out-of-the-can packaging. Campbell's Go is the third entry in our premium shelf-stable soup platform, following Campbell's Slow Kettle and our Gourmet Bisques.","The rate of repeat on Campbell's Go soup continues to be strong. Our challenge with this product is to build trial, which was impacted by the timing of our marketing efforts. Since we've turned on our marketing, which has been largely digital, we've seen improvements in sales in this line.","Campbell's Skillet Sauces are a breakthrough concept with a high potential for reward. With this product, we're working with our customers to create an entirely new category of unique, convenient and versatile dinner sauces. Because this is a new idea, retailers across the country have shelved the product in many different locations in the store, and those locations did not create the scale necessary to capture the attention of shoppers.","Additionally, the resets in these various sections occurred at different times of the year, so with some retailers, we had a later start than we had planned. We now have a clearer understanding of the best way to shelve our new dinner sauces, and this will be a major thrust for us in fiscal '14. But the good news is, is that consumer repeat is very strong. Those who try it buy it again. And as I mentioned at CAGNY, next year we will expand this platform with the launch of Campbell's Slow Cooker Sauces, which address another large dinner behavior.","Compared with our sustaining innovations, like our new varieties of Chunky soup, sales from our breakthrough innovations in Simple Meals remain small, but I'm neither surprised nor discouraged by the fact that we've had some growing pains in introducing brand-new ideas into the marketplace, and we've learned a lot from the launches this year.","In fiscal 2014, we'll refine our approach to the accessibility and appeal of these product lines, and we anticipate that over time, both of these platforms will contribute meaningful growth to our portfolio.","I want to turn now to U.S. Beverages and North America Foodservice, whose third quarter performance were disappointing. First, Beverages. Campbell now competes across a broader spectrum of the immense beverage category than we did a year ago. With our acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, we are now actively participating in super premium fresh beverages, a fast-growing segment in which we're performing quite well, with retail sales up more than 20% this year as measured by IRI.","Our historic roots, of course, are in shelf-stable juices, a category which has been and continues to be weak in the U.S. We compete in the premium segment of the shelf-stable category with V8 100% Vegetable Juice and V8 V-Fusion, and in the value segment with V8 Splash. The value segment is currently one of the bright spots and V8 Splash is doing nicely. We will continue to market it aggressively.","The premium segment of shelf-stable juice is weaker than the total category and that is where our issues are now. Our core V8 100% Vegetable Juice business is down, and over the past few years, new players have entered with other fruit and vegetable blends that compete with our V8 V-Fusion line. Our innovation in this space has had mixed results.","As I've said before, we believe that we can improve the performance of our shelf-stable beverage business by taking a page from the playbook we've successfully used in U.S. Soup. So we're focused now on 2 things: the first is laser-like attention to the basics, with excellence in execution against all the drivers of demand. We've recently improved the quality of our V8 100% Vegetable Juice products and returned to a proven advertising campaign. Next year, we'll enhance our packaging.","Second, we're focused on expansion and faster-growing spaces in this category. Our V8 V-Fusion + Energy drinks and new V8 V-Fusion juice boxes for kids are performing well, and we're growing distribution and increasing marketing support behind these promising new products. We also plan to launch other new products in the fourth quarter and next year.","V8 is a very strong brand, with unsurpassed credentials in health and wellness. Over time, I believe we can reverse the declining trends in our shelf-stable beverage business. We're taking the right steps to do that, and we'll provide more details on our plans at our Analyst Day in July.","I'll now move to North America Foodservice. Although about half of our -- of consumer food dollars are spent in away-from-home eating occasions, the trends in the food service sector, particularly restaurants, continue to be affected by consumers' close management of their discretionary spending in the aftermath of the economic downturn. Our own Foodservice business has been challenged due to the loss of a major restaurant customer and by structural changes in the sector that have caused us to increase trade spending at the expense of margin. However, our fresh soup business in the retail perimeter continues to be a bright spot, with net sales up 8%.","Going forward, we believe we have significant opportunity to grow with national restaurant chains, especially QSRs, and to expand our retail fresh perimeter soup business. We've invested in a new manufacturing line to increase our capacity to make fresh soup, which will enable our expansion in this space. We're also taking a close look at the business model for our core Foodservice business.","Core Foodservice is becoming more complex, more expensive and more commoditized. Industry consolidation and restaurant cost pressures have reduced profitability for manufacturers, and as you would expect, we're focused on keeping our costs down. We're moving aggressively to improve the performance of North America Foodservice in the short term, while laying the foundation for longer-term growth.","Before I conclude, I want to say a few words about 2 other important Campbell businesses: Global Baking and Snacking delivered solid top line performance in the third quarter, with organic sales up 6%. At Pepperidge Farm, there were strong sales gains in both our Goldfish crackers and our Pepperidge Farm cookies. Sales in fresh bakery grew double-digits over the prior year. The shelf-space opportunity triggered by the Hostess bankruptcy contributed to our bakery gains in the quarter.","Our improved execution also played a role. We plan to hold on to some of the shelf-space gains even after competitors return to the market by continuing to demonstrate to customers what an expanded premium offering can do for their business. We're also pleased to see solid sales growth in our Arnott's biscuit business, with increases in both savory crackers and sweet cookies and continuing growth in Arnott's business in Indonesia.","Finally, the addition of the Bolthouse Farms business remains consistent with our plans, and the business is performing very well on both the top and bottom lines across carrots, salad dressings and super premium beverages. Beverage innovations launched by Bolthouse this spring are exceeding expectations. We believe this has been a great acquisition for Campbell, and we continue to be extremely excited about the platform it provides us to expand in the fast-growing package fresh category.","I'll close by offering some brief perspective on the big picture. We have said that our overarching goal is to position Campbell for sustainable, profitable net sales growth by executing against a dual mandate: To strengthen our core business and to invest for long-term growth in faster-growing categories, adjacencies and geographies. We believe that we're making good progress in advancing our plan and in our efforts to change the growth trajectory of this company.","Today, we are managing our core business with a clear view of the role of each business in the portfolio and working hard to optimize the value that each business can deliver. Superior execution and smart innovation are having an impact on our financial performance in Simple Meals and Baking and Snacking, and we've made significant strides in U.S. Soup. And across the portfolio, we're investing for long-term growth in faster-growing spaces, from package fresh to premium soups in the center aisle, to beverages, baked snacks and simple meals that resonate well with consumer groups that represent strategic growth opportunities for Campbell like Millennials and Hispanics. We're also investing in faster-growing markets like Mexico and Indonesia.","We recognize that there is much more that we have to do to fulfill our dual mandate, including improving our performance in shelf-stable beverages and food service. We know what our challenges are and what we have to do to address them, and we expect to deliver improved results in the businesses that have been lagging this year.","As we head into the final quarter of fiscal '13, we feel very good about the progress of the last 2 years. We're also excited about what lies ahead. We're still in the early days of executing this plan, but we believe our strategies are the right ones for Campbell, and we remain committed to them. You'll see us continue to execute against them with energy and unsparing focus as we look forward to ongoing dialogue with you about the results, particularly at our upcoming Analyst Day in July, where we'll provide more details about our fiscal 2014 plans.","Now I'll turn the call over to Craig for a closer look at the third quarter.","B. Craig Owens","Thanks, Denise. Good morning. I'll spend a few minutes walking through our third quarter results and segment highlights, followed by a brief look at our year-to-date results. We'll wrap up with a full year sales and earnings guidance look.","As Jennifer mentioned, my discussion of results will exclude the impact of all restructuring programs for the current and prior years, as well as acquisition transaction costs. For the quarter, we reported net sales of $2.1 billion, a 15% increase, reflecting the impact of the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, which added 11 points. Excluding the acquisition, organic net sales increased by 4%, our best quarterly growth rate since 2009.","EBIT adjusted for restructuring costs, which impacted both the current and prior year quarters, increased by 9% to $293 million. Of the adjusted EBIT increase, 6 points came from adding Bolthouse and 3 points from growth in the base business, primarily driven by a strong performance in U.S. Simple Meals. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.62, an 11% increase from the third quarter of 2012.","As you can see on Slide 22, 11 points of the 15% increase in net sales were attributable to Bolthouse. The growth in organic sales reflected 5 points of volume\/mix growth, pricing contributions of 1 point and the negative impact of increased promotional spending of 2 points. The favorable volume\/mix was from gains in our 3 largest segments: U.S. Simple Meals, Global Baking and Snacking and International Simple Meals and Beverages.","The pricing gains were primarily due to our previous list price increase on U.S. condensed soup, as well as increases in Canadian soup and in Pepperidge Farm. The promotional spending variance is primarily due to higher rates of spending in U.S. Simple Meals, U.S. Beverages and North America Foodservice.","Excluding the impact of current quarter restructuring programs, our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 210 basis points to 36.7%. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of the acquisition of Bolthouse, which operates with a lower gross margin structure. Excluding that acquisition, the impacts of cost inflation and increased promotional spending were largely offset by productivity improvements, the benefit of higher selling prices and favorable mix. The inflation rate in cost of goods was approximately 3% for the quarter.","Marketing and selling expenses increased by 2% to $262 million compared to $256 million a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of the addition of Bolthouse, higher spending to support innovation efforts and higher selling expenses, partly offset by lower advertising and consumer promotion spending.","Despite a 7% decline in advertising and consumer promotion expense, primarily due to U.S. Soup, we had increased spending in Pepperidge Farm, and we continue to support our new product introductions. Our advertising in Simple Meals remains at competitive levels.","Administrative expense increased $28 million to $172 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and higher incentive compensation costs. Net interest expense increased by $4 million. The increase was due to the higher level of debt incurred to fund the acquisition. Average interest rates on our total debt portfolio were lower.","The adjusted tax rate increased by 20 basis points to 26.3%. The current and prior year quarters both benefited from adjustments to reflect lower taxes on foreign earnings. The tax rate in the quarter was lower than the previous forecast, and I'll speak to the impact on the year when I address guidance.","Adjusted net earnings increased by 8%, and adjusted net earnings per share increased to $0.62 for the quarter, reflecting EBIT growth, higher interest expense and a small decline in diluted shares outstanding.","Third quarter segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on Slide 25. Our U.S. Simple Meals segment achieved strong sales growth of 11%. Within the segment, U.S. Soup sales rose by 14%, driven by double-digit gains in ready-to-serve, condensed and broth. U.S. Sauce sales increased 3% compared to the prior year, as gains in Prego pasta sauce and Pace Mexican sauces were partly offset by declines in Campbell's canned pasta. Sales also benefited from the introduction of Campbell's Skillet Sauces.","Our Global Baking and Snacking segment also achieved strong organic sales growth, up 6%, with increases in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's. The sales increase in Pepperidge was driven by growth across fresh bakery, crackers and cookies. Frozen sales declined.","In the bakery business, we continue to benefit from the market exit by Hostess, with volume gains across most of the portfolio. The snacks business had another strong quarter, reflecting solid growth in Goldfish snack crackers and a strong sales performance in cookies. Sales at Arnott's increased, primarily due to sales growth in Australia in savory crackers and sweet cookie varieties and strong results in Indonesia.","Organic sales for our International Simple Meals and Beverages segment increased 3% compared to the prior year. Strong sales gains in Europe and Latin America and growth in the Asia Pacific region were partly offset by declines in Canada. Sales in Europe increased due to volume gains in Germany, France and Belgium. In Asia Pacific, sales increased due to growth in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan, partially offset by sales declines in Australia.","Sales for the Bolthouse Farms and North America Foodservice segment were $344 million, with Bolthouse contributing $205 million. Organic sales, excluding the acquisition, declined 10% compared to a year ago. The sales decline in North America Foodservice reflects the loss of a major restaurant customer and continued higher levels of promotional spending in our core Foodservice business. U.S. Beverage sales decreased by 5% in the quarter, primarily due to the decline in V8 Vegetable Juice.","Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals on Slide 27 increased significantly, up 30% to $156 million this quarter, as we continue to improve the profitability of this business. The increase reflected strong earnings gains in U.S. Soup, partly offset by a decline in U.S. Sauces, which included investments in new products. Within the segment, the benefit of higher volumes, increased selling prices and productivity improvements were partly offset by increased promotional spending.","Earnings at Global Baking and Snacking were comparable to prior year. Growth at Arnott's was offset by the impact of currency. For the segment, higher sales were offset by increased marketing spend and administrative costs.","Within International Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings increased by 8% primarily due to higher earnings in Europe. Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages decreased by 27%, primarily due to lower volume on 100% juice varieties, cost inflation and increased promotional spending. Operating earnings within Bolthouse and Foodservice segment increased by $7 million, composed of a $17 million addition from Bolthouse Farms and a significant decrease in earnings from North America Foodservice.","As with sales decline -- as with the sales decline, the earnings decline in Foodservice is driven by a customer loss and higher trade spending. Bolthouse Farms is delivering results that are consistent with our acquisition plan.","U.S. Soup sales for the third quarter increased 14%, driven by double-digit gains in each of the 3 large categories. Sales of condensed soup rose 11%, driven by double-digit gains in eating varieties, which benefited from increased promotional activity and price realization. Ready-to-serve soup increased 18%, primarily due to significant volume-driven gains in Campbell's Chunky canned soups. Chunky performed extremely well in the quarter, benefiting from new varieties, increased promotional activity and a return to NFL advertising. Sales also benefited from the launch of Campbell's Go soups.","Broth sales increased 18%, benefiting from higher levels of promotional activity, which drove double-digit volume gains in aseptic broth. Our measured consumer takeaway in the quarter was a robust 10%, ahead of category growth. Sales also benefited from an increase in resale inventories.","Year-to-date, U.S. Soup sales increased 5%, primarily driven by a 9% increase in ready-to-serve soup. Sales of condensed increased 2% compared to the prior year, while broth sales increased 3%. U.S. Soup consumer takeaway for the first 9 months was up about 4%.","On the next slide, we look at our market share and category performance based on the past 52 weeks for the U.S. wet soup category. The category as a whole rose by 4%. Our sales in measured channels rose 3.4%, with gains driven by ready-to-serve soup, condensed and Swanson broth. As Denise mentioned, improved execution and the benefit of a colder winter have contributed to very healthy growth.","Campbell's had a 59% market share in the wet soup category, which includes condensed soup, ready-to-serve and broth. All other branded players collectively held a share of 28%, with a 13% private label share. These figures are sourced from SymphonyIRI's multi-outlet report and are based on dollar sales.","A brief recap of year-to-date results begins on Slide 30. In the first 9 months, we reported net sales of $6.8 billion, an 11% increase from the prior year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms. Organic net sales increased by 2%. The organic sales gain was largely driven by growth in U.S. Simple Meals, and Baking and Snacking, partly offset by declines in North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverage.","Excluding restructuring and acquisition transaction costs, adjusted EBIT increased 6% to $1.1 billion. 4 points or $46 million of the increase was attributable to the Bolthouse operating results. While 2 points of the growth came from the base business, primarily driven by earnings gains in U.S. Simple Meals, partly offset by declines in North America Foodservice. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share were $2.19, an 8% increase versus the prior year. The increase reflected EBIT growth, the benefit of a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, partly offset by higher interest expense.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined 170 basis points year-to-date to 37.2%. The addition of Bolthouse drove most of that change. Excluding the acquisition, the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending were largely offset by productivity improvements and the benefit of higher selling prices. The inflation rate and cost of goods sold was approximately 3% year-to-date. Marketing and selling expense were $813 million, essentially flat to the prior year. Our planned reduction in marketing spend, principally a 12% reduction in advertising and consumer promotion expenses, offset the impact of Bolthouse Farms and the higher selling expense for the total company.","Administrative expenses for the quarter increased by $65 million, primarily due to the acquisition and to higher compensation and benefit cost, including increases in pension expense.","Net interest expense year-to-date increased by $14 million due to the higher level of debt to fund the acquisition. The adjusted tax rate declined 9 basis points to 30.3%, primarily due to the resolution of state tax matters and recent changes in U.S. tax law.","Consistent with EBIT growth, adjusted net earnings for the first 9 months increased 6%. Adjusted EPS, benefiting from fewer shares outstanding, increased by 8%.","Cash flow from operations was $864 million fiscal year-to-date compared with $838 million in the prior year. Higher cash earnings and lower benefit plan distributions were partly offset by increased working capital requirements. Capital expenditures of $205 million were up from $173 million a year ago. For the year, we continue to forecast capital spend of approximately $330 million.","As we previously announced, we suspended the strategic share repurchase program at the end of fiscal 2012 in order to reduce the debt incurred to finance the Bolthouse acquisition. However, we continue to repurchase additional shares to offset dilution from equity compensation programs.","Net debt rose to $3.8 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, due to the acquisition, partly offset by cash generation. For the first 9 months, the company paid dividends of $366 million, including an acceleration of the payment normally made in late April or early May.","This morning, we revised our previous fiscal 2013 guidance. We now expect to grow sales at the upper end of the 10% to 12% range and adjusted EBIT at the upper end of the 4% to 6% range. The adjusted EPS, benefiting from a lower-than-expected tax rate and the improved EBIT outlook, is expected to exceed the previous range forecast of 3% to 5%. We now expect EPS to grow between 6% and 7%, in the range between $2.58 and $2.62. We are now forecasting a full year tax rate of between 30% and 31%. Our guidance includes the estimated impact of Bolthouse Farms and excludes the impact of acquisition transaction costs and restructuring charges. The Bolthouse Farms acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $750 million to sales and approximately $0.06 to our adjusted EPS, including the impact of suspending the strategic share repurchases.","Thank you. With that, I'll now turn it back to Jennifer.","Jennifer K. Driscoll","Thank you, Craig. At this time, we will conduct the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Sean?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to focus on the rest of your business, aside from Soup. I think you've addressed some of the weakness in Beverages and Foodservice. I want to focus on the Baking side of the business. Top lines look great, but year-to-date, there's been no bottom line growth. Can you help us understand some of the drivers of the margin weakness there?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. In the Global Baking and Snacking segment, we have continued to cycle. If you'll recall, last year, we had a very difficult year in Australia. We essentially reset trade spending levels in that market. And through the first 3 quarters of this year, we have been cycling against that reduction and then against lower gross margins. The Pepperidge business has performed at a stronger rate than that through the first 3 quarters, and we are -- I guess we're probably about flat in gross margin at Pepperidge through the first 3 quarters of the year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","When are you done cycling that Australian trade spend adjustment? And also, if you could comment a little bit on sort of wheat cost here, where your inflation number sit and what the outlook is going forward?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So we should finish cycling the Australian trade adjustment in the fourth quarter. We should -- yes, in the fourth quarter. And if you look at the inflation forecast, this year, of course, has been a tough one on flours and grains, particularly in the early part of the year. I think as we look forward, we would expect, although it's a little early to tell in terms of timing of crops and whatnot, we would expect a more normal inflation rate in those businesses next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess in Campbell's base business, excluding Bolthouse, perhaps if I'm doing my math right, maybe the gross margin was still down a bit in the quarter, despite a really strong, obviously, top line performance from the high margin Soup business. Final part of that is obviously trends in Beverages and Foodservice. But trying to get a bit of additional color maybe on the magnitude of gross margin and the change in the Soup and Simple Meals segment, just to give us some comfort that the operating leverage that one would expect from that type of sales growth in Soup was what we'd expect it to be or wasn't compromised in any way.","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So gross margin on Soup and Simple Meals did show a positive impact of the leverage that you'd be looking for. We don't disclose precisely, but it was up over 150 basis points in the quarter. And you're right, the things that were depressing the gross margin x Bolthouse would've been NAFs and U.S. Beverage, both of which had pretty significant declines in both -- in gross margin, largely related to increased promotional spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess my question goes -- I think, Denise, maybe it was your comment about -- or maybe it was Craig's, about consumption being less than shipments. Is it your sense that -- is this a timing issue year-over-year given the -- how warm it was a year ago? Or is this have to do with the retailers being a little bit more optimistic about the category? Obviously, with your share, you've got good visibility into what's going on in the shelf. So maybe you could talk a little bit about that excess inventory.","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So measured consumption was about 10%, sales were about 14%. That implies -- and the tracking data that we have where we help manage inventory, would say that retailer inventories were up a bit. I think the good news is that most of that inventory was and is on the floor and we would expect to be moving. It's always a little difficult to forecast. You asked if it was a timing issue, difficult to forecast the fourth quarter. It's such a small quarter. And inventories are certainly going to drop in the fourth quarter, and the question is how much they drop relative to what they dropped last year. But you'd probably expect some of that to come back in the fourth quarter.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so you don't sense that it -- because I think we've gone through several years of inventory declines at retail as the category has shrunk. It isn't -- you don't think it's a -- well, I mean, granted you're going into the summer, but you don't think it's a function of the retailers becoming a little bit more optimistic about shelf space?","B. Craig Owens","Well, I think the really strong sales in the quarter have sort of a natural inflationary impact on inventories. I mean, sales were terrific. They were beyond our own expectations. I think they were probably beyond the retailer expectations. And so as you went through the quarter, I think you saw higher order rates and maybe some of that will stick, Eric. But retailers have got -- I think the primary reason you've seen inventories drop is that retailers have gotten better and better at managing inventory, and we've gotten -- we continue to have really high service levels and are reliable and so they feel like they can operate on thinner inventories.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And if I could just -- last follow-up. Denise, you sounded a bit more cautious about the new products versus the last couple of calls. Was there like any of the inventory build in the soup to-go line? Is it that material that it could have had an impact? Or maybe you can just address how much more spending do you think is necessary to get trial up on -- or sorry, repeat up on the products?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. If I came across as cautious, that's really not the right tone I was trying to set. I'm actually very optimistic about the platforms of the pouched Go soups and also the dinner sauce segment. What I was sharing with you were some of the lessons learned from this year's season. Because one of the things that we do in running an innovation agenda is we track what went right and what didn't and what can we learn from it and then how do we reapply so we get better in the next round. And so we've got very, very, very high hopes for these platforms, and we believe they'll continue to build over time. The thing that I really watch is the repeat rate because right now, the challenge we have is just to build trial because the repeat is really strong. So those that do try it buy it. And what we also are seeing is that it is attracting affluent consumers and more Millennials, which was what the objective was. And that's been highly incremental to the franchise.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one follow-up to Andrew's question on the Soup margins. Can you just say, again, was it volume leverage that predominantly drove the margin expansion or was it better balance on pricing inflation -- and inflation, Craig?","B. Craig Owens","Largely volume, David.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Then my main question is just on advertising and consumer promotion. So it's somewhat odd, perhaps, to see just the incredible performance of Soup, and then in conjunction with that, the comments that A&C spending are down on Soup. So Denise, can you talk about the A&C spending on Soup? Can we -- can you reduce it further because some of it would apparently maybe be just ineffective? So is there just A&C that we can cut out that wasn't really doing anything, but yet this Soup business, with the new products and other activities, can continue to grow?","Denise M. Morrison","I would largely agree with your assessment. I think that you can expect that advertising in fiscal '14 will not be higher as a percent of sales on the base business, but we will continue to be advertising at competitive levels, and I'm talking about the Soup and Simple Meals business here. And we will be funding and advertising our new product innovation. We have and continue to eliminate unproductive spending. And I also believe that we have made incredible strides in terms of the effectiveness of our advertising. And the example is Chunky soup where we did return to the NFL-themed advertising, and that resonated very well with consumers. But I think advertising has to be viewed as only a part of the marketing mix. I mean, we've made quality improvements. We've had new varieties that have added some news to the base and excitement, and we've also had much more effective promotion on the brands. So I think all in all, advertising is finding its way in the marketing mix.","B. Craig Owens","But David, I wouldn't expect to see further significant cuts in advertising as we move forward. As Denise said, I don't think we'll restore the spending because it looks like what we're doing is working. And of course, we'll continue to look for where there's ineffective spending to cut that out. But I think if you think about it in terms of total level, probably not big reductions left.","Operator","Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I could just ask what your thoughts are right now on the international M&A environment, just given sort of your prior commentary on opportunities to grow into geographic adjacencies. And one housekeeping item, if you could provide your D&A number for the quarter?","B. Craig Owens","So I think the question on the international environment for M&A is, as we've said a number of times before, we do believe that we can find opportunities internationally to get us into markets that, for the long term, sustainability of growth for the business would be good for us because they're faster-growing markets than our core markets. I think that we've also said, and it also continues to be true, there are not a huge number of targets out there, and the targets that are out there tend to be pretty hotly contested. We have a pipeline. We started working that pipeline as we -- as Denise came in to the CEO position and we sort of shifted our focus on M&A. We have -- you haven't seen us make an international acquisition yet, and that's largely a result of the fact that we're going to be pretty disciplined as we look at these things. Some of them take time because they're family-owned businesses, and it's a matter of building relationships and waiting for the moment when the family is ready to exit and sell. So we keep working at it, we continue to be disciplined. We think we'll eventually land some good opportunities, but obviously not going to comment on any specific situation.","Denise M. Morrison","Right. To build on that, in addition to M&A, we are also pursuing partnerships where they make sense. So for example, our partnerships in Mexico with Jumex and La Coste\u00f1a to do a distribution and manufacturing agreement for the Beverage business and the Soup and Simple Meal business is pretty exciting for us. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities as well.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","To address your last question, the depreciation and amortization for the 9 months is about $318 million, and that's up significantly versus the prior year because it includes accelerated depreciation on our restructuring programs and also includes Bolthouse Farms.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Denise, you basically announced the Soup business stabilized today. But where would you have to get the U.S. Beverage business to make that same kind of announcement? Is there any kind of top line growth rate or margin target that you have in mind? And if so, which one would be more important, top line or margin?","Denise M. Morrison","I'm not really giving guidance on the Soup business going forward at this point in terms of a number. But suffice it to say that we believe that we've focused on fixing the fundamentals on better execution, on a better optimization of the drivers of demand and a better understanding of the portfolio rules for these brands. And we believe that -- we can say we've stabilized and now we're going to profitably grow as we go forward.","B. Craig Owens","Yes. I think on the beverage business, Thilo, the -- clearly, we are -- as Denise said in her opening, we're not happy with the declines. Part of it is category. The category shelf-stable juice has been very weak. Clearly, we're doing better with portions of that category. Our premium -- super premium fresh juices out of Bolthouse are doing very, very well. Our Splash entry in less than 100% juice is doing well. But the core of our business and the core of our profitability, the red juice business and the V8 V-Fusion business, have not done well. I guess by definition, stability would be to arrest the decline. But we think that over time, the beverage business can grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just did some quick weather math, trying to look at the number of heating days year-to-date 2013, and it looked like the number of heating days really weren't that different from 2011, '10 and '09. It really was 2012 was the anomaly. So I guess -- I know you said it's hard to predict or hard to estimate the impact of whether, but would you say that this was kind of a normal weather year or was it a colder-than-usual weather year 9 months year-to-date?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So it is both hard to predict and to quantify the impact of weather. And frankly, it's not something that we control, so we don't spend a lot of time focused on it. But if you just look at temperature swing, right, you're right, last year was the more unusual year. It was a very warm winter. This year has actually been slightly colder than normal. So the swing is about an 8-degree swing using the numbers that we have, and it has an impact. I mean, it's undeniable that it has a positive impact.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And lastly, on the dividend, I haven't -- have you looked at raising the dividend? And if -- and normally, it happens in fourth quarter, I thought. What's your status there?","B. Craig Owens","We have not announced any change to the dividend, don't intend to announce any change to the dividend in this call. It's an issue that the board continues to look at. If you think about over the last couple of years, Rob, we were down on earnings last year as we went through an intentional reset. We did not decrease the dividend. We held the dividend, and we've held it as we've sort of grown back to the prior level this year. I think I would look certainly to next year, we would expect to continue a positive trend and we would reconsider the dividend at that time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Janney.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess I just wanted to follow up on the line -- on Rob's line of questioning a little bit. I know, Craig, it's difficult to quantify and certainly not something you can control on the weather. But are there like -- how about an 8-degree swing, like you clearly have some methodology internally for thinking about benchmarking performance versus weather. If I were going to try to go back and look either within seasons and say adjust, I mean, can you think of a methodology, the best way to do that? Do you look at days below 50 degrees or days below 40 degrees? And how does that vary across markets?","B. Craig Owens","Jonathan, I think the question itself sort of points to the difficulty, right? You have to get really granular. In other words, what parts of the country? What population centers? What was the weather change in specific geographies? And when did it occur? And honestly, that kind of dissection of weather is just -- I mean, frankly, we don't do it, right? And it's just not that useful because it's not something that we control. So again, at a high level, you can look at the numbers and you can say it had a positive impact, no question about it. We're going to keep our head down and keep working on the things that we do control. And we absolutely do not believe that weather was the primary driver of the improvement that we've seen. We think it's all the other things that we've been talking about, and you saw good share performance, for example, which is independent of weather and some other things that I think point to the fact that we're making some improvement. So we just -- I don't see the value of going as deeply as you'd have to go. And frankly, I think even once you got there, you wouldn't know much more than we know at the high level.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great. And just one quick follow-up, if you wouldn't mind, while we're on the topic of weather and seasonality. Is there seasonality to the margin of Bolthouse Farms? Or is this what appears to be 8% or so margin a good run rate going forward at the EBIT line?","B. Craig Owens","Yes, there's not -- I mean, yes, there's not much seasonality in the Bolthouse business, I don't think. If you think about their product line, it's -- the impact of weather, I think, is pretty minimal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Denise, so can you talk a bit more to the learnings you've gained during the first few quarters of bringing Skillet Sauces to market, particularly around in-store positioning and merchandising? And you talked about having a clearer understanding, but can you give us a sense of what your target or objectives are going forward? And just quick follow-up on that, do you feel that you still have a good first mover advantage in that category, because it seems like a lot of competitors have moved very quickly? And in order to maintain any advantage, do you really need to keep the level of innovation coming very quickly?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. Well, first of all, we do know that it is more difficult to create new market segments. And what happened in the execution of Skillet Sauces is it was shelved in multiple store locations, and what that did was it impacted the reset timings to cut the product end. So as a result, we had a slower ACV build in some retailers than originally planned. The other thing is because it was shelved in multiple locations, it was more difficult for the consumer to find it and more difficult for us to say where it was in our marketing, couple that with the fact that marketing started in quarter 2. But since we started the marketing, we have seen a pickup in the sales, so that's encouraging. So we feel that we'll be working with retailers in 2014 on building out a dinner sauce segment in the store, and we'll talk more about how we're going to do this at Analyst Day. There have been some others that have come into the category. We believe that will add some scale to the segment, and we believe that our execution within that segment with Skillet Sauces and the new Slow Cooker will continue to give us the innovation to maintain the competitive advantage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So this is a question on advertising spending on the new products. From memory, I seem to remember that the advertising budget overall was down a bit this year as you shifted the emphasis more into cheaper digital advertising on the new products, and I think that was to target younger consumers. I guess going forward, are you planning to step up to more traditional TV advertising on those products? And is it possible that by using the digital approach, you may not have reached maybe some older consumers who might not be exactly the target audience but could still be a meaningful part of the sales base? And as a real quick follow-up, if I can sneak it in, are you able to parse apart the U.S. Soup pricing and volume this quarter?","Denise M. Morrison","Let me take the first part of your question first. Yes, we are planning on introducing TV advertising into the marketing mix on the new products. And we have seen that in addition to attracting Millennials and affluent consumers, the products are having broader appeal than what we expected, and that's a good thing. So the TV advertising does make sense. And then the -- I'm sorry, what was the acceptance about Soup pricing?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So the second one, on Soup pricing, as you remember, we had a list price increase on condensed soup coming into the year. The impact across the total Soup category for us was about 2% in the quarter, that would've been fully offset by increases in promotional spending. So net realized price was about flat.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer of UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Congrats on the core Soup sales strength this season. I was wondering if you could dig in to the reasons for this a little bit more. Obviously, we've talked about the percentage point lift to Simple Meals sales from innovation. Obviously, you also had the step-up in the frequency of promotions this year that was, I guess, partly funded by the advertising dollar spend. There was the weather, there was new Chunky advertising, reformulations I guess at the margin, which I guess are more of a focus going forward. Could you almost prioritize these things as you head -- not just look back on fiscal '13, but looking forward, how these proportions might shift in terms of the lift that you see to the Simple Meals segment?","Denise M. Morrison","It was a combination of all of the above. I think that the sustaining innovation that we had on the Chunky soup was very impactful. It added new varieties and new news to the base, and these have been incredibly strong. And you couple that with the NFL-themed advertising. And like I said in my upfront, I believe that, that really resonated with consumers. And I don't think it's any one thing. When we talk about optimizing the drivers of demand, that can look a little bit different by brand, depending upon where that brand is. So we're going to continue on that program.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the last question that was asked. Can you -- when you said 1 point was driven by innovation, I'm assuming that doesn't include innovation on other products and reformulations. Can you -- so first of all, am I right on that? And secondly, can you just talk more broadly about new products as a percentage of sales this quarter? That would be helpful.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. But we talk about innovation in 2 ways, we talk about sustaining innovation, which is news to the base. It's typically new varieties or line extensions. When we talk about breakthrough innovation, it's more disruptive, it's harder and it's designed to capture new consumer segments, new occasions or new usages. And so we do both and we talk about both. But in the innovation that I just talked about with -- it was really focused on Go soup and Skillet Sauces, which were more in the camp of breakthrough innovation.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Any -- can you give us a sense of, of that 10% sort of takeaway growth this quarter, how much came from the other sort of sustainable innovation? I mean, are you seeing better repeat rates or are you doing more trial? I'm just trying to get a sense of what's driving the consumption growth just to get a sense of why it could be more sustainable.","B. Craig Owens","I think one thing we can say on the Chunky business where we had the most significant number of new varieties, that that's a very impactful part of the growth of Chunky soup. It's harder for us to measure more broadly across the sort of Soup portfolio, but the incrementality of any specific item is on a quarterly basis. But the primary reason we don't break that out the way you're asking for it is because it's really difficult to quantify the cannibalization of a formula change or a new product. I think we'll come back probably at the analyst meeting and talk more broadly about the progress we're making and the contribution that, that is making to sales from our total innovation program.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. And in total, we're measuring innovation as a percent of sales on a rolling 3, so we'll be able to share some of that by category with you at Analyst Day.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Craig, in terms of Global Baking and Snacking, it sounds as though there's really not a lot out there in terms of acquisition targets right now. But how much more can you do in terms of maybe joint ventures or even leaning on your Indonesian business more to drive a larger footprint in Snacking over in China. Is that something that you're considering or is it less a priority right now for you?","B. Craig Owens","No, it's absolutely something that we're considering. In fact, one of the things that we have done as we talked about broadening our footprint in emerging markets, we've been very active. Now realistically, they're pretty small, right? If you look at Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico. But we've been very active. You saw us announce a deal for our Soup and Beverage business to really restructure the way we're coming at it in Mexico and broaden our distribution depth very significantly in that market on Beverages. Likewise, we have been investing pretty heavily in our Indonesian business and been seeing a really robust growth rate in that business because of that investment. We're also looking at export models and the possibility and ability to move some of that product. We already have some export out of the Indonesian business but looking at whether we can expand that in Southeast Asia. So all of those things are on the table. I don't want to overstate them in terms of their size because they're still pretty small. But we're looking at all of those avenues.","Jennifer K.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Ma'am, you may begin.","Jennifer K. Driscoll","Thanks, Mary. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, CFO and Chief Administrative Officer; Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations.","Denise will kick us off today in a couple of minutes with her perspective on the full year as we continue to pursue our dual mandate. Craig will then give you the financial and segment results for the fourth quarter, our full year highlights and expectations for fiscal 2014. After that, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com and on our IR app, which is available through Google or Apple.","Please keep in mind that this call is open to members of the media who are participating in listen-only mode.","As a reminder, our presentation today includes forward-looking statements, which reflect the company's current expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to Slide 3 in the presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements.","This morning, we showed for the first time the results of our European simple meals business as discontinued operations. Its assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale. We also completed our annual testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment, resulting in a significant noncash charge related to certain European goodwill and brands.","In addition we recognized an incremental tax charge in earnings from discontinued operations. Let me elaborate just a bit on each of those items before we move forward.","First, given the potential sale of the European business, representing its fiscal 2013 results as discontinued operations and restating fiscal 2012 results accordingly. This business previously had been included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.","Discontinued operations had $532 million in sales last year, adjusted EBIT of $65 million and $0.16 of contribution to adjusted EPS. We plan to provide you with discontinued operations historical results by quarter for fiscal 2013 and 2012 on our website in September.","It may help to see how our adjusted results translate to reported EPS, shown here on Slide 5. I already covered accretion from discontinued ops, showed in the middle column.","Per my second point, lower in the middle column, you see that our annual testing of goodwill and intangibles resulted in a noncash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $0.83 per share related to intangible assets in the European business. We also recorded a tax charge of $0.06 per share on earnings from discontinued operations related to the potential sale.","Turning now to matters impacting continuing operations. Looking at the far left column, in fiscal 2013, the company reported pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs in cost of products sold associated with initiatives to improve our U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across our U.S. thermal plant network; to expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico; to improve our Pepperidge Farm bakery supply chain cost structure; and reduce overhead costs in North America, the latter 2 being in the fourth quarter. The aggregate impact of the restructuring initiatives was $0.28 per share on earnings from continuing operations.","Campbell also completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms one week into fiscal 2013. The acquisition created not only large year-over-year changes in sales and EBIT, but it also resulted in $0.02 of acquisition transaction costs, shown on the far left column.","The majority of our remarks on our call today will focus on results from continuing operations on an adjusted basis, including Bolthouse Farms operating results for 51 of the 52 weeks but excluding transaction costs and restructuring charges. We appreciate your patience in parsing out all of these different items this morning.","Since our presentation includes several non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules, we've provided a reconciliation of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation. These slides, along with our earnings release and selected quarterly financials, also can be found on our website accessible online, of course, or on your mobile device with the Campbell IR app.","I've got one more thing to plug. We would like to cordially invite you to hear our webcast presentation by Denise Morrison, Anthony DiSilvestro and me on September 4 at the Barclays Back-to-School conference in Boston. Campbell's presentation will begin at 1:30 p.m.","Like this earnings call, it will be available live on the web and then later as an archived audio cast. You can find it at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com under News & Events, then just click on Recent Webcasts &; Presentation.","And with that long intro, let me turn it over to Denise.","Denise M. Morrison","Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining Campbell's fourth quarter earnings call. Before we begin, let me lay out our agenda for the call this morning. I'll begin with my perspective on our 2013 full year results and the plethora of actions we have taken to reshape our portfolio for a stronger growth trajectory.","This will provide context for our 2014 guidance ranges and the path we are pursuing to return Campbell to sustainable, profitable net sales growth. Craig Owens will follow with a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results and our guidance, and then we'll take your questions.","I'm pleased with the results that we are reporting this morning. Full year sales and EBIT were in line with our revised guidance, and EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance. As Craig will explain in greater detail, those numbers reflect the combined results of continuing and discontinued operations and excludes special items.","Although I'm encouraged by these results, there is much more work ahead of us and challenges that we must address to build an even stronger foundation for sustainable growth. We've talked many times over the last 2 years about our 3 growth strategies: profitably grow North America Soup and Simple Meals, expand our international presence and continue to drive growth in Snacks and Healthy Beverages.","We've also outlined the significant investments that we are making in brand building, innovation and external development. And we said that our strategic framework translates into a dual mandate: to strengthen our core business and expand into higher growth spaces.","Today, I think it's fair to say that Campbell has made progress as we've executed our dual mandate. We're doing what we said we would do, with a resolute focus on the future of our company.","The centerpiece of our progress in strengthening our core business was the performance of U.S. Soup, which delivered 5% sales growth this year by optimizing the drivers of demand and accelerating consumer-focused innovations. Sales of ready-to-serve soups grew 9%, condensed soups were up 2% and broth grew 4%, led by the strong performance of Campbell's Chunky soup. Chunky's exceptional momentum was driven by the launch of new varieties and our decision to return the brand's marketing focus to its core consumer, males with a big appetite for NFL football and satisfying soup.","We grew our iconic Campbell's condensed soup, a $1.1 billion business, with a wide array of offerings that appeal to a broad range of consumers, particularly children, families and baby boomers. We enhanced the taste of our soups, positioned them more distinctively in the marketplace and improved in-store execution. We rebalanced and optimized advertising and consumer promotion behind our core brands. We accelerated innovation, launching 38 new soups during the year; and yes, we had some help from the weather.","To drive the continued growth of this important core business, you will see many great new products in the new fiscal year, including Campbell's Homestyle soup, a new ready-to-serve range. We're also launching new pub-inspired varieties of Chunky, and Clay Matthews of the Green Bay Packers is our newest Chunky's Mama's Boy.","In Global Baking and Snacking, sales grew 4% for the year, reflecting strong growth of our Pepperidge Farm business, where sales of Goldfish crackers rose 6%. Goldfish is a powerful brand that continues to expand after more than half a century.","We strengthened growth in our Pepperidge Farm cookie business by launching stronger marketing behind our Milano brand and introducing delicious new products like our soft Pepperidge Farm Dessert Shop cookies. We grew share in fresh bakery with good performance in our Pepperidge Farm Swirl breads and as we effectively leverage expanded shelf space in the wake of the Hostess bankruptcy. We're determined to retain most of that space in the new fiscal year.","You'll see many exciting new products to support the continued growth at Pepperidge Farm, including Goldfish Puffs, which are in-store now, and new varieties of cookies.","We're taking steps to strengthen our Arnott's business in Australia, with a focus on improving its capabilities and lowering costs. Arnott's, our third largest brand, delivered strong sales growth in Indonesia.","I mentioned earlier that we must address our challenges in order to drive sustainable growth. Quite frankly, I was disappointed with the performance of our U.S. Beverages and North America Foodservice businesses. But we have a clear understanding of the issues impacting these businesses and what we need to do to get them back on track, starting with our decision earlier this month to strengthen their leadership and management.","Sales in U.S. Beverages were down 4% for the year, reflecting declines in our V8 vegetable juice and V8 V-Fusion juice and juice beverages. Shelf-stable juices have faced intensified competition from the proliferation of specialty beverages, including the dynamic growth of packaged fresh juices. We are focused on improving our shelf-stable 100% juice business, anchored by V8, which has unmatched credentials in vegetable nutrition. We will reinvigorate our V8 business through a disciplined focus on the drivers of demand, continued expansion in the growth segments of the category and relentless attention to cost management.","To reinvigorate growth, we are introducing new products like V8 V-Fusion Refreshers, a lighter fruit and vegetable beverage, and we will continue to expand V8 V-Fusion + Energy and V8 Splash, which delivered its seventh consecutive year of growth.","As we said at Analyst Day, we are focusing on 3 key objectives for North America Foodservice: stabilizing our traditional foodservice business, accelerating the growth of the packaged fresh business in the retail perimeter and innovating to change the game with national account customers. We believe that we have a solid plan for improving our performance in Foodservice in the short term, while laying the foundation for longer-term growth.","As we took action to strengthen our core business, we also made tangible progress on the second part of our dual mandate: to expand into higher growth spaces. We did this by driving breakthrough innovation and accelerating external development.","In fiscal 2013, our focus on breakthrough innovation contributed to our growth in new categories and segments. To pursue growth in the nearly $200 billion dinner segment, we introduced Campbell Skillet Sauces, and we're building on that platform with the launch of new Campbell Slow Cooker Sauces.","To reach new consumers like millennials, we continue to expand in the faster growing premium soup segment, where we're driving innovation with Campbell's Slow Kettle, Campbell's Bisques and new Campbell's Go Soups.","Fiscal 2013 was a banner year for acquisitions and strategic alliances that we believe will accelerate our future growth and change our direction in new and exciting ways. We ended a trio of growth engines through our acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, Plum Organics and the Kelsen Group. These acquisitions have combined sales of approximately $1 billion, and they give us exciting new brand platforms to create value and attract new consumers.","With net sales of $756 million for the year, Bolthouse Farms delivered strong results that met our expectations. It is a leader in the fast-growing $12 billion packaged fresh foods category, with its super premium fresh beverages, baby carrots and refrigerated salad dressings in the grocery store perimeter. Bolthouse Farms has expanded our access to consumers who have a strong interest in fresh foods and health and wellness.","The combination of Bolthouse Farms and our iconic V8 franchise has given Campbell a $1.2 billion beverage platform that spans the full range, from shelf-stable value offerings and mainstream products in the center of the store to packaged fresh super premium beverages in the retail perimeter.","We have the opportunity now to leverage this scalable platform in entirely new ways. For example, we are leveraging the capabilities of Bolthouse Farms to introduce V8 Harvest, our first entry in packaged fresh juices with the V8 brand.","In the new fiscal year, we will make advertising and consumer promotion investments behind Bolthouse Farms to drive brand awareness and build its differentiated positioning. We will continue to launch new Bolthouse Farms products to fuel its robust innovation pipeline. We also have a clear opportunity to expand this brand to new channels and immediate consumption outlets like convenience stores.","In June, we acquired Plum Organics, an innovative brand of premium organic simple meals and snacks for infants, toddlers and young children. Plum Organics gives us a growth platform in the premium organic segment of the $2 billion U.S. baby food category, a segment that grew at an average annual rate of 43% from 2010 to 2012.","With the #2 share in the organic baby food category, Plum Organics also gives us access to millennial parents for whom organic nutrition is a high priority and it's a strategic fit with our $1 billion kids platform. We plan to expand distribution of Plum Organics products to drive growth in fiscal 2014.","The acquisition of Kelsen, which we completed earlier this month, gives us a leading producer of premium cookies with annual net sales of $180 million and popular brands that are sold in 85 countries. It expands our position in new geographies because approximately 1\/3 of its sales are in China and Hong Kong, where it is the market leader in the fast-growing assortment segment of the sweet biscuits category.","Kelsen also gives us a broader net distribution network in Asia, South America, the Middle East and Africa that will provide many potential routes to reach new consumers in the growing $60 billion global sweet biscuit market. We see longer-term opportunities to leverage Kelsen's distribution network to expand our Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm brands in China and around the world. We expect the acquisitions of Plum Organics and Kelsen to contribute approximately $300 million to our sales growth in fiscal 2014.","During the year, we also entered into strategic alliances in Mexico to expand our access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in this key market. We expect these commercial agreements with Grupo Jumex, the largest producer of fruit juices and nectars in Mexico and Conservas La Coste\u00f1a to enhance our growth in beverages, soups, broth and sauce.","Since we are committed to expanding internationally, I think it's important to share my perspective on why we have made a strategic choice involving the potential sale of our European simple meal business. As we announced previously, Campbell is in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of its European simple meal business.","This potential transaction includes brands such as Liebig in France, Erasco in Germany, Bl\u00e5 Band in Sweden and DevosLemmens and Royco in Belgium. The proposal also includes the sale of 4 plants in those countries.","We will continue to export Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's products throughout Europe and Campbell's products to the United Kingdom. Kelsen, which is based in Denmark, will continue to sell its products in Europe. In the short term, the impairment charge for the European simple meals business was the reason our company posted a fourth quarter net earnings loss on a reported basis, but we are committed to making strategic choices that are right for Campbell in the long run, and this is the right choice.","Across our company, we are focusing our brand building investments, resources and talent on iconic brands that we believe we can grow around the world. Our strategy is to build brand equity, which will create value for our shareholders.","Consistent with our strategy, we are investing in core brands like Campbell's, Pepperidge Farm, Goldfish, Arnott's, Prego, Swanson and V8, and new businesses in faster-growing spaces like Bolthouse Farms, Plum Organics and Kelsen. All of the actions that we have taken to strengthen our core business and expand into faster growing spaces are reshaping our brand portfolio and shifting our center of gravity for a greater growth trajectory in the long term.","You can see that the direction of Campbell is changing a step at a time. We're reshaping our portfolio, which now features 10 powerful brands with sales of more than $100 million each, led by our $2.1 billion Campbell brand. We're building a more diversified portfolio with more growth engines. Excluding Europe and including our 3 acquisitions, we expect soup to account for about 1\/3 of our sales this year versus more than 40% in fiscal 2012.","We are focusing on our 3 core categories, but we've broadened our scope within each category to pursue faster-growing segments and adjacencies. We're building new connections with multiple demographic groups and new generations of consumers. We are seeking productivity opportunities to fund our growth, and we are creating a high-performance culture, leveraging our high engagement.","Looking ahead to our plans for fiscal 2014, we're focused on increasing sales from U.S. Soup and Simple Meals, Global Baking and Snacking and Bolthouse Farms; fixing our U.S. Beverage business and North America Foodservice; accelerating innovation with the launch of more than 200 new products; expanding our availability in club, dollar, e-commerce and immediate consumption channels; increasing our packaged fresh offerings in the retail perimeter; driving international growth in new and existing markets with a strategic focus on Asia and Latin America; and pursuing smart external development.","In closing, I'm excited about our direction and our progress, as we focus forward with a strategic plan that is building momentum and delivering results. We remain committed to achieving our long-term growth targets, and we acknowledge that we have more work to do as we continue to reshape Campbell in a changing consumer and economic environment. We are confident in our 2014 plan and committed to delivering it.","Thank you for the opportunity to share my perspective on Campbell's solid performance and our progress this year as we continue to execute our dual mandate. I look forward to answering your questions following Craig's detailed review of our financial results and our guidance.","B. Craig Owens","Thanks, Denise. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being with us today. I'm going to begin by discussing our fourth quarter results and segment highlights, and I'll follow that with a review of our full year results and wrap up with a look at fiscal 2014 sales and earnings guidance.","As Jennifer mentioned, my discussion will exclude the impact of all restructuring programs and acquisition transaction costs for the current and prior year, as well as the impairment charges and tax adjustment related to our European business.","In August, the company announced the potential sale of its European simple meals business. This business was previously included in our International Simple Meals and Beverages segment, which is now reported as a discontinued operation.","We will begin the review of the fourth quarter and fiscal year results with a look at the combined continued and discontinued operations and then focus on the results of the continuing operations.","So in the fourth quarter, combined continuing and discontinued operations net sales increased by 13% to $1.8 billion, reflecting the Bolthouse Farms and Plum acquisitions, which contributed 11 and 1 point of growth, respectively. Adjusted EBIT increased 4% to $217 million and adjusted earnings per share were $0.45, a 10% increase from the fourth quarter of 2012, benefiting from EBIT growth and a favorable tax rate.","Moving now to our fourth quarter results from continuing operations. We reported net sales of $1.7 billion, a 13% increase, reflecting the impact of Bolthouse Farms and Plum, which added 13 points together. Excluding the acquisitions and currency, organic net sales increased by 1%, with gains in Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Simple Meals, partly offset by declines in International Simple Meals and Beverages and U.S. Beverages.","Adjusted EBIT was comparable to a year ago at $208 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, EBIT declined by 7%, due to higher incentive compensation expenses. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.43, an 8% increase from the fourth quarter of 2012, benefiting from a lower tax rate.","As you can see on Slide 32, after the contribution from Bolthouse and Plum, the 1% growth in organic sales reflected 1 point of volume mix growth and 1 point of pricing, offset by 1 point of promotional spending. Currency had a negative 1 point impact, due to the Australian dollar weakening against the U.S. dollar.","The favorable volume mix reflects gains in our 2 largest segments: U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking. The pricing gains were primarily due to our list price increases on Arnott's biscuits and U.S. condensed soup, as well as increases in Pepperidge Farm. These increases were partially offset by pricing declines in Mexico based on our new distribution business model. The promotional spending variance is primarily due to the higher rates of spending in U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 230 basis points to 36.7%. The decline is primarily attributable to the impact of the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, which operates at a lower gross margin structure. Excluding the acquisition, the impact of cost inflation was mostly offset by productivity improvement. The inflation rate in cost of goods sold was approximately 3% in the quarter.","Marketing and selling expenses were comparable to a year ago at $191 million. Lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses were offset by the impact of the addition of Bolthouse. Advertising and consumer promotion expense declined by 14%, including decreases in U.S. Soup and U.S. Beverages.","Administrative expense increased $32 million to $195 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs compared to below target levels in the year-ago quarter and to the addition of Bolthouse Farms.","Net interest expense increased by $5 million to $30 million. The increase was due to the higher level of debt incurred to fund the Bolthouse acquisition, which was added at lower average interest rates than the total debt portfolio.","The adjusted tax rate decreased by 590 basis points in the quarter to 24.7%. The decline in the tax rate was primarily due to lower state taxes and an increase in the U.S. manufacturing deduction. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 5% to $136 million, benefiting from this lower tax rate.","Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $0.43 for the quarter. Percent change on the chart was impacted by rounding.","Fourth quarter segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on Slide 35. Our Global Baking and Snacking segment achieved strong organic sales gains, up 5%, driven by growth in Pepperidge Farm in Indonesia, partly offset by declines in Arnott's Australia.","The strong sales gains in Pepperidge Farm reflected growth across fresh bakery, crackers and cookies. In the bakery business, we continue to benefit from the market absence of Hostess, with double-digit volume gains across sandwich, bread and rolls.","The snacks business had another strong quarter, including solid growth in Goldfish snack crackers and a strong sales performance in cookies. Sales at Arnott's decreased primarily due to sales declines in Australia across sweet cookie and chocolate varieties, partly offset by strong growth in Indonesia.","Our U.S. Simple Meals segment delivered $493 million in sales, including a $14 million contribution from the acquisition of Plum Organics. U.S. Simple Meals achieved strong organic sales growth of 4%. Within the segment, U.S. Soup sales rose by 4%, driven by gains in ready-to-serve soup and broth.","And U.S. Sauce sales increased 4% also compared to the prior year, driven by gains in Prego pasta sauce, including new items in white sauces and red distinctive sauces. Sales also benefited from Campbell's Skillet Sauce, which was introduced in the first quarter.","Sales in the Bolthouse Farms and North America Foodservice segment were $300 million, with Bolthouse contributing $185 million. Organic sales excluding the acquisition declined 5% compared with a year ago. This sales decline in North America Foodservice reflects the loss of a major restaurant customer and continued higher levels of promotional spending in our core Foodservice business.","Organic sales for the International Simple Meals and Beverage segment decreased by 5% compared to the prior year. Sales declines in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region were partly offset by higher sales in Canada. The Latin America decline is part of the new distribution -- is due to the new distribution arrangement in Mexico, as we phase in ahead of the full change to the business model there.","In Asia Pacific, sales declines in Australia were partially offset by gains in Malaysia. U.S. Beverage sales decreased 4% in the quarter, primarily due to a decline in V8 vegetable juice. Sales of V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash also declined in the quarter.","Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased by 6% to $110 million this quarter. The increase reflected strong earnings gains in U.S. Soup, partly offset by a decline in U.S. Sauce. Within the segment, the growth in operating earnings was primarily driven by productivity improvements and high volume -- at higher volumes, sorry, partly offset by increased promotional spending and higher administrative expenses.","Earnings in Global Baking and Snacking increased 1% to $84 million. Strong earnings gains in Pepperidge Farm were partially offset by a decline in Arnott's and the unfavorable impact of currency. For the segment, higher sales were mostly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased administrative costs.","Operating earnings within Bolthouse and Foodservice increased by $15 million, including a $17 million contribution from Bolthouse Farms and a decrease in earnings from North America Foodservice. Bolthouse delivered results consistent with our acquisition plan.","Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages decreased by 20%, primarily due to cost inflation and sales declines, partly offset by productivity improvements.","Within International Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings decreased by 22% to $14 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings in the Asia Pacific region and Mexico.","On Slide 38, you can see that U.S. Soup sales for the quarter rose 4%, driven by strong gains in ready-to-serve soup and broth. Sales of condensed soup were comparable with a strong prior year quarter, which had experienced 14% growth. For the current quarter, increases in cooking varieties were offset by decreases in eating varieties.","Ready-to-serve soup rose 9%, primarily driven by volume gains in 100% Natural as we increased promotional activity in conjunction with the transition to Campbell's Homestyle Soups. Sales also benefited from the first year sales of Campbell's Go Soups.","Broth sales increased by 13%, primarily driven by double-digit gains in aseptic broth. Campbell's measured consumer takeaway in wet soup for the quarter was up 3%, ahead of category growth. For the fiscal year, U.S. Soup sales increased 5%, with gains across all 3 categories. Condensed sales increased 2% for the year; ready-to-serve sales rose by 9%, driven by volume gains in Chunky canned soup, which benefited from new varieties, increased promotional activity and the return to NFL advertising. Broth increased 4% for the year. U.S. Soup consumer takeaway for the fiscal year rose about 4%.","On the next slide, we take a look at our market share and U.S. wet soup category performance in the past 52 weeks. The category as a whole rose by 3.5%. Our sales in measured channels rose 3.7%, with gains driven by ready-to-serve soup, condensed soup and broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, an increase of 10 basis points, a better performance than prior year.","All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, with private label having a share of 13%. These figures were sourced from SymphonyIRI multi-outlet reports and were based on dollar sales.","On the next slide, you see the fiscal year -- the fiscal year results for continuing and discontinuing operations combined. Net sales increased 11% to $8.6 billion, reflecting our acquisitions of Bolthouse Farms and Plum. Adjusted EBIT increased 6% to $1.3 billion. Fiscal year adjusted earnings per share were $2.64, an 8% increase versus the prior year. The increase reflected EBIT growth, the benefit of lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense.","For the fiscal year, in continuing operations, we reported net sales of $8.1 billion, a 12% increase from the prior year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Bolthouse and Plum. Organic net sales increased by 2%. The organic sales gain was primarily driven by growth in U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking, partly offset by declines in North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverages.","Adjusted EBIT increased 6% to $1.2 billion, primarily due to the acquisition of Bolthouse, which contributed $63 million of EBIT this year. Excluding the acquisition, EBIT was comparable to prior year, reflecting sales growth and lower marketing expense, offset by higher administrative expenses, higher selling expenses, a lower gross margin percentage and higher research and development expense.","Fiscal year adjusted earnings per share were $2.48, a 7% increase versus the prior year. The increase reflected EBIT growth, the benefit of a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense.","For the fiscal year, our reported net sales for continuing operations increased by 12% with acquisitions, primarily Bolthouse contributing 11 points of growth. Organic sales excluding acquisitions increased 2%, reflecting 1 point of volume mix growth and 2 points of pricing, partially offset by the negative impacts of increased promotional spending of 1 point. You'll note that the detail does not add to the total due to rounding.","On a segment basis, organic sales growth in Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Simple Meals was partially offset by declines in North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverage. Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined 190 basis points to 37.3%. The decline was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms. Excluding that, the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending were mostly offset by productivity improvements and the benefit of higher selling price.","The inflation rate in cost of goods sold was approximately 3%, as expected. Marketing and selling expense increased by $6 million to $947 million. The increase was driven by the addition of Bolthouse expenses and higher selling expense, mostly offset by lower marketing spend, principally reductions in advertising and consumer promotion expenses. A&C expense for fiscal 2013 declined 12% to $419 million compared with the prior year. Administrative expense increased $97 million to $677 million, primarily due to acquisitions and higher incentive compensation costs.","Net interest expense increased by $19 million for the year due to the higher level of debt to fund the Bolthouse acquisition. The adjusted tax rate declined by 130 basis points to 29.8%, primarily due to lower state taxes, including the favorable resolution of certain matters and an increase in U.S. manufacturing -- in the U.S. manufacturing deduction.","Adjusted net earnings from the continuing operations increased 6% to $786 million, driven by EBIT growth and a favorable tax rate, partly offset by higher interest expense. Adjusted EPS were $2.48, a 7% increase versus the prior year. EPS benefited from 2 million fewer shares outstanding.","Fiscal year segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on Slide 45. Sales of U.S. Simple Meals increased by 4%, with gains in both U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauce. As mentioned earlier, U.S. Soup sales rose 5%, driven by gains in ready-to-serve, condensed and broth. U.S. Sauce sales grew by 3%, primarily driven by growth in Prego pasta sauce and Pace Mexican sauces and the launch of Campbell's Skillet Sauce, partially offset by lower sales in other Simple Meal products.","Global Baking and Snacking sales increased by 4%, fueled by gains in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's. Pepperidge Farm sales increased on the strength of solid growth in fresh bakery and Goldfish snack crackers and sales gains in cookies. Sales at Arnott's increased primarily due to gains in Indonesia.","Sales for the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment were $1.3 billion, with Bolthouse contributing $756 million. Organic sales excluding the acquisition declined 8% compared with a year ago. The sales decline in Foodservice was primarily due to the loss of the major restaurant customer and higher levels of promotional spending.","International Simple Meals and Beverage sales were comparable to the prior year, as gains in China, Canada and Latin America were offset by sales declines in export and Asia Pacific. Sales of U.S. Beverages decreased 4%, with sales declines in V8 vegetable juice and V8 V-Fusion, which were partially offset by sales growth in V8 Splash.","Fiscal year operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased by 11% to $731 million. The increase reflected strong earnings gains in U.S. Soup, partly offset by a decline in U.S. Sauce, which included investments in new products. Within the segment, the increase was primarily driven by a higher selling price and productivity savings, partly offset by cost inflation.","Earnings of Global Baking and Snacking increased $1 million to $316 million, reflecting growth in Pepperidge Farm, mostly offset by lower earnings at Arnott's.","Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages decreased by 10% versus prior year, primarily driven by lower sales and lower gross margin percentage, partially offset by reduced advertising expense. Operating earnings within the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment increased 36% or $31 million. The increase included $63 million from the addition of Bolthouse Farms and a decrease in earnings for North America Foodservice, driven by lower volumes and an increased promotional spend.","Within International Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings increased 2% compared to the prior year. The rise in operating earnings is primarily due to China, reflecting lower marketing expense, partially offset by lower gross margin percentage.","Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the fiscal year compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to increased working capital requirements, partially offset by higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures of $336 million rose from $323 million a year ago.","As we previously announced, we suspended the strategic share repurchase program at the end of fiscal 2012 in order to reduce the debt incurred to finance the Bolthouse acquisition. However, we continue to repurchase sufficient shares to offset dilution from equity compensation programs.","Net debt rose to $4.1 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, primarily due to the acquisitions. For the fiscal year, the company paid dividends of $367 million.","Turning to Slide 48. In fiscal 2014, we expect continuing operations to grow sales by 5% to 6%, adjusted EBIT by 5% to 7% and adjusted EPS by 3% to 5% or $2.55 to $2.60 from a base of $2.48. Fiscal 2014 comprises 53 weeks, 1 additional week compared to 2013, the benefit of which is expected to be largely offset by the anticipated impact of currency translation.","We expect acquisitions to contribute approximately $300 million to sales growth, 1 percentage point of EBIT growth and $0.02 of EPS.","In connection with the accounting for the new business model in Mexico, we expect a decrease in both sales and cost of sales of approximately $40 million in the international segment, with no impact on EBIT. Thus, our organic sales growth expectation is 2% to 3%, with an additional 3 points of sales growth expected to come from acquisitions, net of the impact in Mexico.","We continue to expect inflation in cost of products sold at 2% to 3% and productivity gains of approximately 3%. Net interest expense is expected to be comparable with the prior year. EPS growth reflects the impact of a significant increase in the tax rate, which is estimated to return to a more typical range of 31% to 32% in fiscal 2014. This guidance range assumes no share repurchase under our strategic share repurchase program in fiscal 2014. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $350 million.","As we look ahead, we expect the current retailer inventory levels and holiday timing may constrain sales growth in the first quarter. In addition, our significant new product launches and an associated increase in marketing spending are projected to put pressure on the first quarter's profit growth.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jennifer.","Jennifer K. Driscoll","Thank you, Craig. At this time, Mary, we're going to conduct our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Mary?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Craig, I'm wondering, I guess, why for both the fourth quarter and the full year, even when you exclude the negative mix impact on gross margin from the addition of Bolthouse, maybe why we haven't seen more significant gross margin expansion? Just because some of the high-margin businesses obviously did quite well over the course of this past year and in the fourth quarter, meaning Simple Meals, Pepperidge Farm and such. So a little more color on that would be helpful.","B. Craig Owens","Sure, Andrew. Certainly, the success of soup this year has been a positive influence on gross margin. A more negative influence would have been somewhat higher promotional spend for the year. It brings us back to about flat at gross margin, excluding the impact of rolling in the acquisition.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And any thoughts on just how that might look as we think forward for the year, coming into '14 around gross margin?","B. Craig Owens","As we look at gross margin, and I think maybe we said this at Analyst Day, we see slightly mitigated inflationary pressure, and we continue to forecast pretty good results from our enabler program and productivity savings. Those should largely be offsetting. We've got a price increase that we talked about in our condensed soup line. That will not have quite as much positive impact as last year's increase because we have not moved up promotional price points. So you've got some positives and some negatives. I guess, it would be slightly positive to gross profit as we look -- to gross margin as we look forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to circle back on Europe. I guess, I was surprised by the profitability there and the impact on earnings. Seems like you've given us all the bad but none of the potential good on this. So can you talk a little bit about the magnitude of stranded [ph] costs, the path to potentially working those down, anticipated proceeds, potential tax leakage and then use of that cash?","B. Craig Owens","So with respect to stranded costs, there's about $10 million of overhead that has previously been associated with Europe, so that's not included in the discounted (sic) [discontinued] ops line. It moves back into corporate as we change the accounting there. Since the deal has not been completed, we are not disclosing at this point the sale price. And as we look forward, we expect, assuming everything goes well with the consultation with works councils and government approvals that we would probably close the deal in the first quarter, and then we'd have all the detail out on the sale proceeds and the tax impact there.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I look forward to those details. The $10 million of overhead and just staying on overhead, I noticed admin expenses for the firm overall as a percentage of sales are at a decade high. You're talking a lot about productivity. Why aren't you going more aggressively after attacking some of these costs?","B. Craig Owens","Well, so inside of the administrative costs, particularly as you look at the quarter, there's -- we're cycling last year below target, incentive cost payments with higher payment levels this year. We also have, for the year, as we look back, higher pension expense and higher health benefit costs. If you start to strip out some of those impacts, we have what we would call good results in our SG&A cost, particularly at the corporate level. And we continue to look at that. If you think about productivity overall, we had a great year in our enabler program inside of cost of sales. We had -- we were right at 3%, maybe slightly over 3% and would expect to be there again next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson from Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I guess, the first simple question was did you give an interest expense guidance number for '14?","B. Craig Owens","I think we did not give an interest guidance number for '14. It should be about flat to '13.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay, perfect. And then, I guess, kind of a larger strategic question is just I know over time, we've been pointing to kind of the weakness in soup. '13 was an anomaly, frankly, on the sales side, and Andrew just asked a question on the margin side. But when Denise kind of points to the soup going from 40% to 1\/3 of total sales, I mean, how do you think about that over the next 3 years or so on a margin basis, just considering that is the highest margin area of the business? So as you act upon the dual mandate and move into these higher growth areas, is the expectation that growth kind of post-'13, both on a sales and a profitability basis, could be a little bit lower in soup? I'm just trying to get a little color on how you think about the potential negative margin mix as you move forward within the dual mandate.","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So I think it would be a mistake to focus on margin in exactly the way that you suggest there. I mean, we look at getting -- trying to optimize top line and bottom line growth. The change in mix, first of all, the soup brands that we will potentially divest in Europe are at considerably lower margin than the soup brands that we have and continue to hold in the U.S. business. I think Europe's overall EBIT margin is around 12%. And the businesses that we are adding, while they are somewhat dilutive to margin, the question is really whether they're adding top line and bottom line growth at returns that are good for the capital that we're investing in. Really, nothing that we've invested in is in any way cannibalistic against any of our core business. So we're focused on growth, top line and bottom line, and we're very focused on return. And then margins are, of course, an important metric and something that we look at constantly on an operational basis. But I think to think about those sort of segment by segment is probably the better way to think about it.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up. What you said about the 12% Europe margin, and I believe we got an e-mail about that this morning as well, it looked like the actual segment, the full segment came in at like 11.9%, it seemed like, for the year, plus or minus. So is it fair to say that the margin in Europe for the segment could have actually been a little bit higher than the actual segment? So there could be some potential margin -- there can be a positive margin mix shift for soup globally. But for that actual segment, there could be a little bit of pressure in '14?","B. Craig Owens","I think it's very close, right? The divested businesses are pretty much right on top of the margin for the total segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, my question, one quick one on the follow-up to -- I think it was Jason's question. So this $2.55 to $2.60 range, that basically, at this point, doesn't assume any use of proceeds. I assumed that would be to pay down debt post the sale of Europe. Any tax benefit associated with that? Who knows? Or I guess, whatever positive -- would that lean you towards the high end of the range once those -- once the sale goes through?","B. Craig Owens","So Eric, in there, there is about $0.01 of assumption on debt reduction.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So you've assumed some benefit or some of the divestiture proceeds, et cetera, but maybe not the stranded overhead exit?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. I think we've taken -- in effect, I think we've taken sort of the most conservative stance there as we've looked forward, both with respect to the proceeds and their use, as well as to the stranded overhead. So the stranded overhead is still in there. We intend to take some action to try to identify offsetting savings. As you might imagine, it's not so easy to directly find that stranded overhead in the corporate headquarters mix and take it out. Europe was not that big a business for us. There aren't many people at corporate that are directly associated with Europe. So it's more a matter of finding offsetting savings than it is targeting Europe-related costs.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","The other point to make is although we've assumed debt reduction in fiscal '14, all things the same. It will accelerate the data, which we'll return through share repurchase in the future.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then to Denise, I guess, I'm a little -- just broader picture, it seems as if a bunch of the food companies that have reported of late have kind of indicated a somewhat more sluggish consumer than maybe the -- a lot of the management teams had seen in the spring. I guess, I know you can't necessarily comment on Walmart specifically. But our retail analyst was out there the other day, and they were kind of suggesting a little bit more price aggressiveness to drive volume, along with coordination on new products. You're calling out today some excess inventory levels, which will crimp the fiscal first quarter results. So can you just kind of talk a little bit about kind of what you're seeing from the consumer as we move through the summer? Is the trade deloading issue kind of a reaction to the slower growth? And kind of how the portfolio then sets up for what seems like a somewhat tougher environment all of a sudden?","Denise M. Morrison","Okay. Eric, I think for us, the last couple of years have been looked at as a very challenging consumer and retail environment. And we continue to accept that as a given and run our play despite that. And I do think that your observation is correct that particularly in the recent quarter, it has been a little bit less robust. But that said, I think that is the operating environment we're in, in the food business, and people still have to eat. So we're going at it pretty aggressively. In terms of the inventory, I think I'm going to let Craig handle that one coming out of the fourth quarter.","B. Craig Owens","Yes. So I mean, just the facts are that as we came out of the third quarter -- in the third quarter, so a big soup quarter, we had sales about 4 points ahead of consumption. I think our sales were about 14, consumption about 10. We had a much smaller delta in the fourth quarter, but again oversold by maybe 30 basis points or so what the consumption data said. So we're just recognizing the fact that as we come into the first quarter this year and retailers start to go into their build mode, their inventories will go up in total. But there may be a little bit of a drag on sales versus consumption as they come back to more normal levels. The other thing in that -- in the quarter that's sort of mechanical is that because of the calendar, Thanksgiving's load-in -- pre-Thanksgiving sales are largely going to be a second quarter event this year instead of a first quarter event. So that also weighs on the quarter a little bit.","Jennifer K. Driscoll","And this is Jennifer. That's mostly stuffing and condensed soup and broth, things like that.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then, I'm sorry, just last follow-up to Denise. You're -- you've obviously made a lot of portfolio changes, and that's kind of -- that's challenging for an organization but necessary, and I think what you've done is logical so far. Is -- are you at a point now where you kind of feel that -- you've made 3 acquisitions, one big divestiture, is this kind of what we have to work with for the moment? Or if more deals come along, you're ready, willing and able?","Denise M. Morrison","Well, I think it's fair to say that we are continuing to look for smart external development if it makes sense in our categories. The year we've had this year has been unusually busy. And I -- look at the fact that over the last 2 years, we've identified targets, and a lot of them hit this year. We will have years that are active and years that are a little bit drier. But we're going to be very, very disciplined about external development and make sure that we really believe that anything we bring into Campbell's will add extra value for our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede from Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Denise, in your press release, you talked about having optimized the drivers of demand for U.S. Soup. Combined with the fact that the innovation this year is maybe a little bit less breakthrough than you had last year, does that imply that the organic growth rates that you've had in soup in fiscal '13, that's as good as it gets and will be hard to get back to that kind of level? And kind of related to that, is there ever going to be a point where you shift the focus of your dual mandate more towards the growth part of it rather than maintaining the strength of the core?","Denise M. Morrison","I really think that the dual mandate, with a focus on both strengthening the core and expanding into new growth spaces is the right way to think about it. We really do believe that the best source of value creation is really by having a robust core business, especially because our core is so profitable. And so we do have our resources actually focused against driving growth there and also expanding into the faster-growing spaces. I was pretty happy with the growth of soup this year and expect that to continue, while we drive more growth in those faster-growing spaces. I think that's a formula that gets us to our long-term growth targets and beyond.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","If you've got support from weather and you've got support from a lot of new innovation and you've got support from, as you put it, optimizing the drivers of demand, what's going to be the incremental benefit that you get in fiscal '14 to maintain the growth rate? Why wouldn't it slow down again in U.S. Soup?","Denise M. Morrison","Well, the drivers of demand are really all about improvements in execution. So when you think about what we're doing in 2014, I mean, we've improved the taste and quality of many of our flavors and recipes. We have a whole new line of ready-to-serve soup coming to market with Homestyle that capitalizes on a consumer need that's really well researched. We do have continued emphasis on the faster-growing premium segment, which we continue to bring new users into the category. So we're pretty -- Chunky has a very strong program. Condensed has new advertising. So we continue to work on the programs, the advertising, the consumer promotion, the innovation and making sure that we get the right shelf configurations. All of those basics are really important in this category. So we're pretty positive about U.S. Soup.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had a quick question for you, and it's a bit of a follow-on from an earlier question. But I know you had like a little benefit in the quarter from 100% Natural in trying to work that product off the shelf. I think it looked to me like the Homestyle product got on the shelf pretty quickly. And I guess, I also -- so I'm just curious how that benefited U.S. Soup in the fourth quarter. I think you've indicated, certainly, Q1 is a little bit of a lapping issue from the inventory. And then also, could you talk about the new product benefit in the soup business for the year like roughly what that contributed to revenue?","B. Craig Owens","Well, so you're right, Chris, we did have -- we had some promotional push to just try to accelerate that switch out of 100% Natural to Homestyle. In the quarter though, the sales were only ahead of consumption by 30 basis points, so it wasn't a dramatic inventory push. Again, we're mostly looking back to the third quarter and just recognizing that we built some inventories that haven't come out completely yet, some disparity between sales and consumption. So that -- the 100% Natural product moved through the shelf, were moved out to retailers and then moved through the shelf and then off as you recognized in your comment about the trade, and we're pretty happy with where we are in terms of merchandising and shelf presence with 100% -- sorry, with Homestyle as we come into the year.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Most of the RTS sales gains in the quarter comes from 100% Natural.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So like the Go Soups or the Slow Kettle, all of the new varieties, do you have like a rough contribution of what that added to sales maybe for the year or even for the quarter?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","Yes. For the year, it's about 1 point.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner from Wells Fargo.","Dennis Geiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Dennis Geiger filling in for John. Could you discuss what you're seeing in shelf-stable juices as it relates to the pricing environment and what your expectations are for the discounting environment going forward?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. Shelf-stable juices have been, as a category, under pressure from competition in fresh and really the proliferation of specialty beverages. There is a bifurcation going on, where the value part of the category is performing very well, and we're seeing that in our sales of V8 Splash, as well as the super-premium beverages in the fresh perimeter, and we're experiencing that in our Bolthouse Farms business. Where we've been under pressure has been really in the V8 100% Vegetable Juice and the V-Fusion line. And we have plans in 2014 to introduce a new V8 V-Fusion Refreshers product, which is -- has a light and refreshing taste, which we believe will add some new news to that part of the category and stimulate some sales. We continue to push our V8 V-Fusion + Energy, which is also a hot trend in the category, and then the expansion of our kids' juice boxes as well. So we do have plans to reinvigorate the growth of that business and -- but I was pretty disappointed with it this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wanted to follow up on some of the big picture food question. I think Eric got into that a little bit. But I want to be specific on something. The food stamp program is expected to see some declines in what's being issued, I think, in November. Number one on food stamps is do you have any kind of number for us about what you think your exposure is to food stamps? And then number two, specifically to the November cuts, do you think that, that has any effect on your business?","Denise M. Morrison","David, we're not expecting the reduction of the supplemental nutrition assistance program to have a material impact to Campbell's.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right, well, that's clear. And then just one quick follow-up on the debt, Craig. I think you said interest expense is expected to be flat year-on-year. I believe you've got...","B. Craig Owens","I said interest -- yes. Interest expense, yes, right.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. I think you have 2 bonds coming due though, 2 $300 million bonds. Is this -- what's your expectation here? And maybe with those things coming due and being retired, why wouldn't interest expense be down?","B. Craig Owens","I think one of them expires right at the very end of the period, so it won't have much impact. And the Kelsen coming on is sort of the offset, right, the Kelsen debt coming in, which wasn't in last year's number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Denise, I just wanted to focus a bit on your comments because you talked a little bit about building brand equities. And clearly, you've taken some strong steps toward this end and deserve a lot of credit for that. But I guess, one part I'm curious about is promotions, right? I mean, and I mentioned this at the Analyst Day. It's the seventh straight year you had higher promo spending that cut into your gross sales. And I think the general perception is that promo spending can impair equity growth -- brand equity growth, not help it. So I'm just curious how you think about kind of balancing the decision to raise promo spending with building brand equities, and whether those 2 can kind of coexist or whether that's not even the right way to think about it.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. I think our higher promotion spending has been linked largely to the battles we're fighting in beverages and also in the Arnott's business in Australia, as that market has changed, and also in the highly competitive Foodservice business where we've experienced some structural changes with the advent of group purchasing organizations. That said, Ken, and I really do believe this, getting the right marketing mix between the advertising and consumer promotion and the customer and shopper marketing that's going on is more complex today than it has been in the past. And we're wrestling with things like TV versus digital, which may show up as a lower expense, but reaching a targeted audience that we need to get to. So I think that on a by business basis, the approach we're taking is to go business by business, looking at competition and then figuring out what's the best marketing mix for each business that gives us the best growth at the best profit. And so that's how we're approaching it.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One really quick little follow-up. You mentioned that the promo spending was sort of focused on a couple of areas. But as I look down your promo spending for the -- each of your 5 segments, it was a headwind to every single segment. So how do I think about that in correspondence with what you said it was sort of focused on 1 or 2 areas?","Denise M. Morrison","Well again, I think that we go business by business and look at competition, what it takes to win against the drivers of demand in each of those businesses. And for example, in the soup business, when we looked at our advertising, we were way above the spending level of competitive Simple Meals. And so we've adjusted that and we're channeling our advertising and consumer promotion against new product innovation and new news in the category. But all of these brands are well supported from an advertising and consumer promotion standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Craig, just one more speculative, I guess, question on the European business divestiture. I mean, given the eventual closing of that transaction and the proceeds you expect to receive there, do you think that increases, over the course of the next year your flexibility to or the likelihood of considering dividend increases or reinstatement of share buybacks at some point?","B. Craig Owens","Well, I guess the literal answer to that question is yes, but I don't think it changes anything in the way that we think about our priorities. We haven't -- while we've done a lot -- while we've had a lot of activity over the course of the last year, we still feel like we've got some balance sheet capacity. We have said on dividends that we would expect to grow roughly with earnings but also keeping an eye on where the total food group is in terms of payout ratio. We've said that we continue to look for acquisition targets that we think are value adding over time. So none of that changes. But yes, it brings some cash in and gives us a little bit more firepower.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just with respect to the share repurchases, should we consider that still an open issue over the course of the year? Or is that more likely to be a fiscal '15 dynamic?","B. Craig Owens","So the guidance we gave assumed that we do not restart. Clearly, if we get the European deal closed and that creates some proceeds, you could think about that as moving forward, but I'm not sure it would move into '14.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Craig, just a quick question. I want to make sure I understood. I was a little surprised that the 53rd week is fully offset by foreign exchange. Could you just -- how much are you estimating the 53rd week is worth?","B. Craig Owens","It's a little bit less than 2%. It's a smaller quarter for us than average. The week is in the fourth quarter, right? It's a summer week, so it's a little bit less than average, but yes.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then the translation is, I guess, most of it is really the Australian dollar, U.S. dollar exchange?","B. Craig Owens","Yes.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And is there anything -- you're just assuming current exchange rates today. There's nothing unusual about that calculation?","B. Craig Owens","Yes. I mean, typically, unless we see something really peculiar, we're not forecasting movement. We're just taking current spot and assuming that, that's where we are for the year. And that's the case in this guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays.","Unknown Analyst","This is Casey Overlander [ph] on for Priya. Could you elaborate on your plan for the upcoming October maturity and also any additional color on debt reduction plans going forward?","B. Craig Owens","Yes, Casey [ph]. Thanks for the question. I think for the October maturity, our expectation would be that we would pay that off, would not issue another long-term instrument and that would be part of our cash use for the year, right?","Operator","Our last question comes from Akshay Jagdale from KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just can you give a little bit more color on Bolthouse and perhaps a little bit on Plum just in terms of what you've seen from the business from a positive standpoint? And perhaps you can comment on anything that perhaps hasn't gone as well as you planned and how you're dealing with that.","Denise M. Morrison","This is Denise. I'll start with Bolthouse. First of all, we were really pleased with the performance and the integration of Bolthouse Farms in their first year as part of Campbell's. They continue to have a very robust innovation pipeline. Going forward, they're nationally going to launch a baby carrot snack product called Shakedowns, which we're pretty enthused about, in addition to continuing the momentum on their super-premium fresh beverage business and salad dressings in the refrigerated produce section. As I said in my opening comments as well, we're very excited about the potential for V8 Harvest, which is the first V8 entry into fresh juice. So all in all, we think that from a business standpoint, that's gone really well. Culturally, we've been able to keep their entrepreneurial spirit and provide them with some of the resources and the scale that Campbell has to offer. In terms of Plum, it's still early days, and Plum is in the process of being integrated into our North America platform, while retaining a team of very talented entrepreneurs that have joined the Campbell family. And we've got nice expectations for the expanded distribution of that business to get us more access in the super premium -- I'm sorry, the premium organic baby food business. And that's a nice addition to our kids business, which is about $1 billion right now.","Jennifer K. Driscoll","Thanks, Akshay, and thank you, everybody.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ken Gosnell, Vice President, Finance Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Ken Gosnell","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2019. With me here in New Jersey are Keith McLoughlin, Interim CEO; and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO.","As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media, who participate in a listen-only mode.","Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in the appendix of this presentation.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Keith McLoughlin, Interim President and CEO. Keith?","Keith McLoughlin","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone.","Today, we will discuss the progress we've made executing the significant actions we announced on August 30, following our comprehensive Board-led strategy and portfolio review and in that context, review our first quarter results. As we stated at that time, fiscal 2019 will be a transition year for Campbell as we take steps to turn around the Company, and the year-over-year results we reported today reflect that.","This morning, I will give you an overview of the steps we're taking to implement our new strategy, and in that context, share my perspective on our performance. Then, our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro, will walk through the financial details of the quarter and our fiscal 2019 guidance which we reaffirmed today.","Moving to Slide 4. As you'll recall, we announced on May 18, that the Board was launching its own strategy and portfolio review process, one with outside advisors and which all options were on the table. Together with those advisors, we evaluated a full slate of potential options for Campbell, including optimizing our portfolio and divesting assets, splitting the company in two and selling the entire company.","After considerable analysis and evaluation and as discussed on August 30, the Board concluded that at this time, the best path forward to maximize shareholder value and maintain flexibility going forward is a three-pronged strategy. First, optimize our portfolio and focus on our core businesses with an emphasis on execution; two, divest certain non-core businesses in order to focus the Company, while significantly paying down debt; and three, to increase our successful multi-year cost saving efforts, while driving improved asset efficiency.","We have not wasted time since then and we're doing what we said we would do. We are actively making Campbell a highly focused company that is built around our two core North American businesses, Snacks and Meals and Beverages. These are strong businesses, where we have the right to win with franchise brands, best-in-class products, and significant market positions.","I will get into more specifics about each business in a moment, but I want to share a specific example of the greater operating discipline, resulting from our increased intensity, particularly in our core North American operations. Put simply, we are improving our execution and delivering on our commitments to create a stronger, more focused and more disciplined company.","In late September, we had noted in our 10-K, that we were experiencing significant higher than expected costs, as well as considerable shipment delays across our Meals and Beverages portfolio, because of supply chain challenges we faced early in the quarter related to the start-up of a new distribution center in Ohio.","This facility, which is operated by a third-party, will ultimately enable us to serve a broader customer base and provide greater service flexibility. During that same time period, our plant in Maxton, North Carolina, literally became an island as the flood waters rose from Hurricane Florence.","In response, we deployed across functional team led by supply chain experts and sales leaders that displayed amazing teamwork and moved with urgency to overcome these issues with our third-party logistics provider.","They made substantial improvements in the final month of the quarter to recapture the vast majority of these sales. It was a herculean effort and is indicative of new Campbell that we're building. This focus is carrying over into other areas of the Company as well.","Let's start with soup. Moving to Slide 5. Within our Meals and Beverages business, our top priority is to stabilize and improve the performance of our soup business. As we have discussed, soup is a great business and we are taking it back to basics approach, leveraging our market leading brands and driving improved execution across the portfolio.","In fiscal 2019, we are resetting the value proposition for U.S. soup. This starts with increased focus on our key brands, each of which we're managing with rigor and according to a specific portfolio role. Campbell's, Swanson, and Chunky are being managed to maximize margins and cash flow and Pacific and our Well Yes! brands are being managed to drive strong profitable growth.","Despite the sales decline in the quarter, there are many reasons we're optimistic about soup, including greater operating discipline, improved merchandising, and a new management team, that is moving quickly and decisively to improve performance. The supply chain challenges I mentioned earlier hampered the start of the quarter, but soup gained momentum as the quarter progressed and soup sales grew in October.","As we look to improve performance in soup, we outlined several areas of actions, when we spoke in August and let me highlight them here. First, our emphasis on adjusting price gaps is showing signs of progress, despite the challenging retail environment. This year we have more competitive pricing on key segments as we enter soup season versus a year ago.","Second, we are optimizing our merchandising with increased frequency and breadth compared to a year ago. And third, we have refocused our marketing efforts around a new campaign with the iconic Campbell's brand front and center.","In October, we launched a new contemporary campaign that features our Campbell's condensed, as the recipe starter for delicious and affordable family meals. We are driving efficiencies in our spend and focusing our marketing dollars on our most profitable brands to both increase purchase intent and strengthen long-term brand equity.","We launched soup advertising later than usual this past quarter due to the distribution facility start-up issues that I previously mentioned as we sought to ensure marketing aligned with distribution capability.","Soup advertising began appearing in the last two weeks of October, compared to September a year ago. While soup consumer marketing spend was lower than a year ago, we expect our soup marketing investments to normalize in the second quarter as we enter the heart of the soup season.","Additionally, our Swanson broth business had a particularly good quarter. Swanson sales and share growth are driven by category momentum, expanded distribution, and a new marketing campaign that also started in October. Part of our back to basics approach on soup, includes selected consumer-driven innovation. In the quarter, we launched Campbell's Well Yes! sippable soups for affordable on-the-go snacking to attract new consumers to the category. It's early days, but the launch has gained strong distribution and early velocity is ahead of our expectations.","Turning to Pacific. We are pleased with the performance of the brand and the progress of the integration. We are taking steps to increase our production efficiency and distribution capabilities at Pacific, as it continues to perform against this portfolio role to drive strong profitable growth and in line with our acquisition expectations.","Our focus on operating discipline has been elevated across the division, particularly in soup. The result is a more effective Meals and Beverages leadership team that is executing well. Stabilizing soup is our top priority, given the importance of this business. We are executing the plans we outlined back in August with increased emphasis on price realization, optimized merchandising support, targeted consumer-driven innovation, and more effective and contemporary marketing focus on the iconic Campbell's master brand.","We are doing the right things and are encouraged that our plans are beginning to have an impact. As we said last quarter in fiscal 2019, we will rebase soup and strengthen our value proposition in the marketplace. We have made progress against that objective to start the year. That said, we acknowledge that there's much more work to be done and it will take time to fully stabilize the business.","I want to talk about the focus and execution in our snacking business and the combination of the Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance portfolios to form Campbell Snacks. The combination of these powerful portfolios establishes Campbell's as a leading player in the attractive and growing U.S. snacking market. We continue to see opportunities to drive significant top line growth and margin expansion in Campbell Snacks, as we invest and innovate across our portfolio of leading brands, capture cost synergies, and create an enhanced culture of performance and accountability.","The two businesses that comprise Campbell Snacks are robust. This quarter marks the 16th consecutive quarter of organic growth in Pepperidge Farm, and the underlying Snyder's-Lance business is strong as well with share growth in six of our eight key brands this quarter, including Lance, KETTLE, Cape Cod, Pretzel Crisps, Emerald, and high double-digit growth in our Late July brand.","As we've discussed previously, it's worth noting that prior to the closing of the acquisition, the former Snyder's-Lance management team executed SKU rationalization and price realization plan that didn't materialize, which have been a headwind to consumer takeaway, particularly for the Snyder's of Hanover brand.","We are driving innovation across Campbell Snacks by executing against key consumer snacking insights. The combination of Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance enables us to leverage a vast manufacturing network to create new innovations such as Goldfish, epic crunch. A new line in that older kids, which was developed in Pepperidge Farm's kitchens and made Snyder's-Lance bakery.","There are numerous examples where we're transferring expertise across the portfolio, such as applying our real food knowledge to drive reinventions and products like Lance crackers with color source from plants, and Pop Secret made with natural flavors.","As we integrate and drive synergies, we are diving into the portfolio role of these brands across our portfolio and making capital investments to support our growth franchises. Specifically, we are expanding capacity in Goldfish, Milano, and KETTLE, all of which are examples of brands that are growing and driving share growth in their respective categories.","From a value capture standpoint, our Snyder's-Lance integration and synergy actions are on track. The team is delivering synergies across the business, including and manufacturing procurement, warehousing and distribution, as well as, streamlining our managing processes. In supply chain, we're leveraging our scale to reduce input cost and we are accelerating our investments in automation to improve our cost structure.","We're delivering on our integration and synergy commitments, and we expect continued progress going forward. We are confident in the long-term growth and margin expansion potential for Snyder's-Lance.","We have created a single Campbell snacks leadership team accountable for our North American snacks business that is applying a consumer first approach to growth, delivering against our integration efforts, and fully leveraging our deep knowledge of snacking that spans both Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance.","Moving to Slide 7. The second leg of our new strategy is to divest non-core assets. This serves a number of purposes, it allows us to accelerate our focus significantly pay down debt and strengthen our balance sheet.","On August 30, we announced our intention to begin this divestiture process by selling Campbell International and Campbell Fresh as we focus on our core businesses in North America. We started to work immediately after our last call, to begin the process of divesting these two businesses, our financial advisors have been actively soliciting.","As expected, there has been very strong initial interest from a range of potential strategic and financial buyers for these assets, because both are solid businesses made up of great brands. We continue to believe these businesses will be a greater value to new owners, who are focused on these categories and geographies.","Combined, these businesses represented approximately $2.1 billion in annual net sales in fiscal 2018. We intend to use the proceeds to pay down debt and combined with ongoing strong free cash flow, we aim to achieve a target leverage ratio of 3x net debt to EBITDA by the end of fiscal 2021.","We continue to expect to announce buyers for these businesses before the end of the fiscal 2019. But our overwriting goal remains to run a highly disciplined process on a timeline that will achieve the maximum value for these attractive assets. As we also stated in August, we are not complete, we will continue to review additional actions to further focus and refine our portfolio against our go-forward strategy.","Moving to Slide 8. The third leg of our strategy is something that we have delivered on effectively over the last several years, cost savings. On August 30, we announced plans to cut another incremental $150 million from our overall cost as well as steps to drive asset efficiency in working capital and capital expenditures, as we build a leaner, more focused, and more agile company.","We have already started on this work and have continued to deliver meaningful cost savings with an additional $45 million realized in the first quarter. This remains a core Campbell strength and we are confident in our ability to deliver the full $945 million in cumulative annualized savings by the end of fiscal 2022.","Our focus on cost reductions and asset efficiencies help drive improved cash flow, which continues to allow us to return value to our shareholders with $107 million in quarterly cash dividends, while continuing to invest in our core business. As we said previously, fiscal 2019 will be a transition year for Campbell as our new management team guided by the Board operationalizes our plans to focus our portfolio and dramatically improve our execution.","I want to emphasize that the actions we're implementing are the right ones at this time to create shareholder value. The Board and management team are committed to look deleveraging the Company, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and rewarding our shareholders through long-term earnings growth and competitive cash dividends.","I also want to reiterate that the Board remains committed to evaluating all strategic options if they can demonstrably enhanced value above and beyond the significant actions that we are currently undertaking.","With that as context, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter, we are improving our execution and our results, we're on track with our expectations, leading us to reiterate our fiscal 2019 guidance for this transition year. We're hard wiring our operating plans to our key priorities, KPIs, employee objectives, and compensation practices to build a culture of performance, we're enhanced speed, decision making, and accountability are foundational.","We are breaking down silos and working together in new ways across the company as evidenced by the continued successful integrations of both Snyder's-Lance and Pacific and the speed at which we acted to fix the supply chain issues at the new distribution center, this is quite encouraging.","As you can see we are moving quickly to implement the plans we announced back in August and we are making measurable progress across all of our key priorities.","And now, let me turn it over to Anthony for a discussion of our financial results. Anthony?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks Keith.","Before getting into the detail, I'll make a few comments on our performance. Overall, our results were in line with our expectations and we are on track to achieve our fiscal year goals. As we disclosed in our 10-K in connection with the transition to our new U.S. warehouse optimization model, we experienced start-up issues at our new Findlay, Ohio distribution center early in the quarter, which were impacting our ability to ship product to our customers.","The Findlay facility, which is operated by third-party logistics provider serves as the Midwest hub for distribution or a majority of our Meals and Beverage product. In October, we are able to recover quickly from the start-up challenges and despite $12 million of incremental cost, we finished the quarter with financial results that were in line with our original expectations.","As we called out on the August 30 call, we expected the first quarter to be negatively impacted by a change in revenue recognition, the voluntary recall of flavor blasted Goldfish and some continued pressure on U.S. soup as we implement our promotional programs for the upcoming soup season.","The impact from a change in revenue recognition which accelerates the timing of expense related to promotional programs at a 1 point negative impact on net sales, a 50 basis point impact on gross margin, and a 4 point negative impact on adjusted EBIT, the equivalent of $0.04 per share.","Our organic sales declined 3%, including the 1 point negative impact from the change in accounting. And while the Goldfish brand have recovered well, we experienced some negative impact from the July 2018 voluntary recall of flavor blasted Goldfish. Excluding these two items that were more one-time in nature, the balance of the sales decline was mostly U.S. soup.","During the quarter, we implemented our promotional programs for the upcoming soup season and are encouraged by the improving trend. We continue to achieve our cost savings goals against our aggregate program, which includes Snyder's-Lance. We generated $45 million of incremental cost savings in the quarter, bringing the program to-date total to $500 million.","As we've discussed, we are now targeting to reach $945 million of costs and synergy savings by the end of 2022. We are pleased with the progress made on the acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods. The integration of these businesses is on track and the financial performance is meeting our expectations. Combined, the acquisitions were neutral to our adjusted EPS results in the quarter.","Given our first quarter performance and outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal 2019. And in connection with our plan announced August 30, we intend to divest our international snacking business and the Campbell Fresh business. Together with our financial advisors, we've initiated divestiture processes and have seen significant buyer interest for both businesses.","I will now review our detailed results. For the first quarter, net sales on an as reported basis increased 25% to approximately $2.7 billion, reflecting the recent acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods, and as I mentioned, organic sales declined 3%.","Adjusted EBIT decreased 2% to $410 million, excluding the 4 point negative impact from the change in revenue recognition, adjusted EBIT increased 2%, driven primarily by the incremental earnings from the recent acquisitions, partially offset by 12 point decline on the base business reflecting gross margin pressure.","Adjusted EPS decreased 14% or $0.13 to $0.79 per share, reflecting adjusted EBIT declines in the base business, including the $0.04 negative impact from the change in revenue recognition, partly offset by lower adjusted tax rate. In aggregate, the acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods had no net impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter.","Breaking down our net sales performance for the quarter, organic net sales declined 3%, driven by higher promotional spending and lower volume. Lower volumes were primarily the result of decline in U.S. soup. Promotional spending negatively impacted net sales by two points, one point of which was the result of the new revenue accounting guidance, which accelerates the timing of promotional expense.","The impact of the accounting change is not expected to be material for the fiscal year. The balance of the increase in promotional spending primarily reflects increased spending on the U.S. soup business. There was a one point negative impact on net sales from currency translation this quarter. And the recent additions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods to the portfolio, added 29 percentage points, bringing our as reported net sales increase to 25%.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased 4.9 point in the quarter. Excluding a 190 basis point dilutive impact from the acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods, our adjusted gross margin percentage declined three points, while the acquisitions are reducing our overall margins as we add them to the portfolio, we are confident that the margins on these businesses will increase over time as we integrate them into Campbell and achieve targeted cost and synergy savings.","Cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 290 basis points, a majority of which was cost inflation, which on a rate basis increased approximately 4.5%, reflecting higher prices on steel cans, vegetables, wheat, dairy and resins as well as the continuing escalation of transportation and logistics costs.","The balance of the margin decline was driven primarily by higher than expected distribution costs associated with the start-up of the Findlay, Ohio, distribution facility. These negative drivers were partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Higher promotional spending including the 50 basis points impact of the change in revenue recognition, had a negative impact of 140 basis points.","Portfolio mix had a negative impact of 20 basis points. Pricing had a positive impact of 30 basis points, reflecting actions taken in our Global Biscuits and Snacks segment. Lastly, our supply chain productivity program, which is incremental to our cost savings program contributed 120 basis points of margin improvement. All in our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased to 31.6%.","Moving on to other operating items. Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 12% in the quarter, due primarily to the impact of recent acquisitions, probably offset by lower advertising on the base business within Meals and Beverages. The reduction in spending reflects a reallocation of support from advertising to promotional spending, reduced support levels in light of the distribution challenges, faced earlier in the quarter and a later start to our U.S. soup campaigns relative to the prior year.","Adjusted administrative expenses increased 19% to $163 million, due primarily to the impact of recent acquisitions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, adjusted administrative expenses increased slightly, reflecting costs associated with the current proxy contest.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.13 from $0.92 in the prior year quarter to $0.79 per share in the current quarter.","On a currency neutral basis, adjusted EBIT had a negative $0.01 impact on EPS, reflecting lower EBIT on the base business, inclusive of a $0.04 negative impact from the change in revenue recognition, partly offset by the addition of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods. Net interest expense increased by $63 million, a $0.16 negative impact to EPS, driven by an increase in the debt levels to fund our recent acquisitions and reflecting the impact of higher interest rates.","Our adjusted EPS benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate, increasing EPS by $0.04. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.3% in the quarter, which declined by 3.9 percentage points, due primarily to the lower U.S. federal tax rate, offset partly by the favorable settlement of certain U.S. state tax matters in the prior year quarter.","And lastly, there was a $0.01 negative impact on EPS from currency translation this quarter, completing the bridge to $0.79 per share. And although not shown on the chart, in aggregate, the acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods were neutral to adjusted EPS.","Now turning to our segment results. In Meals and Beverages, organic sales declined 5%, driven primarily by declines in U.S. soup, Prego and Canada partly offset by gains in V8 beverages. The segment sales were negatively impacted by one point from the change in revenue recognition. Excluding the benefit from the acquisition of Pacific Foods and the impact from the change in revenue recognition, sales of U.S. soup decreased 6%, driven by declines in ready-to-serve and condensed soups, partly offset by gains in broth. The sales decline in U.S. soup, reflects continued competitive pressure across the market and increased promotional spending.","We are encouraged by the improved trends through the quarter as we implemented our promotional plans for the upcoming soup season, while consumer takeaway dollar sales declined 7% in the quarter, they were comparable to the prior year in the last four-week period. We are also encouraged by the performance of V8 beverages, which achieved sales gains in the quarter driven by V8 +Energy and the core vegetable juice business.","Segment operating earnings declined 11% to $294 million. The decrease was driven primarily by a lower gross margin percentage, partly offset by lower advertising expenses. Gross margin performance reflects the impact of higher levels of cost inflation, increased promotional spending, including the impact from the change in revenue recognition and higher than expected distribution costs associated with the Findlay, Ohio distribution facility start-up.","Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending October 28, 2018, the category showed a decline, decreasing 40 basis points. Our sales in measured channels, including Pacific on a pro forma basis declined 4.6%, as we continue to wrap the major customer issue that we started to face a year ago. We had a 58.6% market share for the 52-week period, down 250 basis points from the year ago period.","Private label grew share, increasing 160 basis points, primarily reflecting gains and brought finishing at 15.9%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 25.5%, increasing 90 basis points. Although not shown on the chart for the four-week period ending October 28, 2018, our sales, the measured channels were up 20 basis points, a notable improvement versus the latest 52-week period.","In Global Biscuits and Snacks sales were $1,218 billion in the quarter, including $554 million from the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Please note that we've moved the Latin America business to the Meals and Beverages segment and have adjusted prior period results. Excluding the benefit from the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, and the negative impact from currency translation, organic sales decreased 1%, driven primarily by declines in Kelsen cookies in the U.S.","Sales of Pepperidge Farm, Goldfish crackers increased slightly in the quarter. As expected sales of Goldfish crackers were negatively impacted by the voluntary product recall in July 2018, although we are very pleased with how the brand has recovered.","On Snyder's-Lance, it is important to note that the SKU rationalization and price realization initiatives are having a negative impact on sales growth, particularly on the Snyder's of Hanover brand. While SKU rationalization is having a short-term impact on sales, this action will result in a more streamlined and profitable portfolio going forward.","Snyder's-Lance sales performance was in line with our expectations with the core brands achieving sales growth as measured by consumer takeaway and with six of the eight core brands achieving market share gains. Segment operating earnings increased 32% to $154 million, reflecting a 45 point benefit from the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, segment operating earnings declined, due primarily to a lower gross margin, reflecting higher level of cost inflation.","In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 1% to $232 million driven by declines in refrigerated soup, Garden Fresh Gourmet, and Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages, partly offset by gains in carrots. Segment operating loss was $3 million compared to a loss of $6 million in the prior year. Although modest, the stick this $3 million year-over-year improvement reflects improved operational efficiency in beverages, partly offset by the impact of refrigerated soup volume decline.","As disclosed in our non-GAAP reconciliation in corporate, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge on the fixed asset of our refrigerated soup plant as we consider a potential sale as part of our planned divestiture of the Campbell Fresh segment.","On a companywide basis, cash from operations increased to $231 million compared to $188 million in 2018, as lower working capital requirements and lower payments and hedging activities were probably offset by lower cash earnings.","The cash outlay for capital expenditures, with $111 million, $53 million higher than the prior year, reflecting the timing of cash payments as well as investment to support our cost savings initiatives and the addition of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods to the portfolio. We continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $400 million for fiscal 2019. We paid dividends totaling $107 million compared to $111 million in 2018.","As previously announced, we suspended our share repurchases in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Net debt of $9.6 billion is up from $3.3 billion a year ago, reflecting the impact of the $6.1 billion acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, and the $700 million acquisition of Pacific Foods, partly offset by positive cash flow generated by the base business.","As part of our August 30 plan, we have initiated processes to divest our international snacking business and Campbell Fresh and we'll use the proceeds from these divestitures to reduce debt and improve our leverage ratio.","Now, I'll review our 2019 guidance, which is unchanged from August 30. As we did previously, we are providing guidance based on our existing portfolio of businesses and also on a pro forma basis, assuming planned divestitures were completed as of the start of the fiscal year with proceeds used to reduce debt. I'll start with the guidance pre-divestitures. We expect sales to increase to a range of $9,975 billion to $10,100 billion as we benefit from the incremental impact of both the Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods acquisitions.","This top line guidance implies that organic sales are expected to decline slightly, while we're seeing improved trends as we implement our promotional programs, we anticipate that U.S. soup sales will decline in 2019. In addition, we expect sales in Campbell Fresh to be negatively impacted as two major private label refrigerated soup customers will in-source production starting in 2019.","We expect adjusted EBIT to be in the range of $1,370 billion to $1,410 billion as declines on our base business are mostly offset by the incremental acquisition impact of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods. Both of these acquired businesses are performing in line with our expectations and represent significant long-term growth opportunities.","The EBIT decline on the base business reflects the anticipated decline in organic sales, the negative impact of 4% to 5% cost inflation on gross margin, and the negative impact from higher incentive compensation, which was significantly reduced in 2018.","We are forecasting a decline in our gross margin percentage of approximately 2 point as cost inflation and higher promotional spending, are only partly offset by 3% cost productivity and benefits from cost savings. Gross margin trends are expected to improve in the back half of the year for several reasons.","A positive impact from the change in accounting, wrapping the Snyder's-Lance acquisition, pricing actions were currently implementing in the marketplace, phasing of productivity gains and some moderation of year-on-year cost inflation. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.53 per share. The delta between EBIT and EPS performance is primarily driven by the interest expense associated with the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods.","We expect interest expense in the range of $375 million to $390 million, and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 25%. And against our cost and synergy target, we expect to retrieve $120 million of savings. We are also providing forecast for 2019 on a pro forma basis, assuming the planned divestitures were completed as of the beginning of the fiscal year and based on the use of estimated proceeds to reduce debt. As you can see on the chart, our sales base decline to about $8 billion, adjusted EBIT to a range of $1,230 billion to $1,270 billion, and adjusted EPS to a range of $2.40 to $2.50.","The overall anticipated dilution from the divestitures is modest given the current level of profitability of the Campbell Fresh division. As I've stated, we've initiated divestiture process for both Campbell International and Sea Fresh and have seen significant buyer interest for both businesses.","That concludes my remarks. And now, I'll turn it back to Keith.","Keith McLoughlin","Okay. Thank you, Anthony.","And before we open up the call to questions, I just want to touch on the CEO search process. The Board has been extremely thorough to make sure it selects the right candidate to lead Campbell through this important time. This is a very attractive role to a number of highly qualified internal and external candidates.","The Board continues to have extensive discussions with a number of candidates who possess deep experience in consumer packaged goods and a strong track record of proven results. The Board continues to expect to name a permanent CEO by the end of the calendar year.","In summary, we're seeing the early signs of improved execution and performance this quarter. We're confident that our plans provide a clear strategic path forward and a strong foundation for executing the Campbell turnaround. We are squarely focused on our plan and will not be distracted from our mission, executing the plan to maximize value for all shareholders, much more work lies ahead, but we're pleased with the overall pace of our progress.","And now, let me turn it back to Ken to open up the call for your questions. Ken?","Ken Gosnell","Thanks Keith.","We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time, I request out of courtesy to the other callers, please ask only one question at a time. Okay, Crystal.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","So I guess my question is just around the cost savings, I think it was $45 million of savings in the first quarter and you're still guiding to a $120 million for the year and I think, Anthony, you said that you expected more productivity in the back half. So could you just square, I guess if we're running at $45 million in the first quarter, why the savings won\u2019t be more than $120 million for the full year?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, sure, Bryan. So as you pointed out, we are at $45 million against the full year guidance of $120 million. So that's about two-thirds of that will come through cost, the other third through SG&A. My comment earlier about cost savings was meant to address productivity.","So in addition to these cost savings programs, we target 3% of cost - of productivity savings every year and it's those savings that are a little bit more phased to the back half than the first half this year. So that was what I was addressing.","Bryan Spillane","So the comps productivity was less than 3%, than in the first quarter?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi. Your line is open.","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask Keith, you got a bit of a chance here to see Campbell's from the Chief Executive Officer role, obviously you've been on the Board for years. You have $945 million laid out in the synergy capture, $500 million already achieved, $445 million left to go. Simple math would say that this is worth more than a $1 a share in terms of gross impact to Campbell's. Consensus estimates, couple of years out Keith, they only go up like $0.20.","The question to you is, you\u2019ve got a chance to look at these savings, are they real? Do you believe in this buck a share or better in savings potential? And then how much of this can actually go down to the bottom line on Campbell's or do you foresee most or all of this needing to be reinvested back into the business to restore top line growth?","Keith McLoughlin","Yes, that's a good question, and I think you partly answered a lot of that actually. So I think these numbers are real and having been on the Board for a few years, I've watched the Company execute on these cost initiatives and now, of course, being with the management team here, I see why they're good at it. It's a very disciplined and robust process and we track it rigorously, and of course, now in the middle of those meetings.","So my confidence that we'll do it is high. As you know, to get to the $945 million, you have the $0.5 billion of the current program which is getting close to being complete or at least meeting that number. We've got the $295 million from Snyder's-Lance and we're reporting on that frequently as you can imagine, and we put the challenge up with another $150 million.","So I would say that of the $945 million, that's $150 million - additional $150 million is where we\u2019ve got to get more traction, we've got to get more line of sight, we've got obviously work underway to do that, but there is more work to do there. But Anthony, you've been leading the big part of those for us for several years and now with the new \u2013 can you add to that?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, totally agree Keith, that we're highly confident against the $945 million. I think the other way to come out is in the context of our long-term growth algorithm and how do you get from 1% to 2% sales to 4% to 6% EBIT growth.","And that delta implies about 50 basis points of margin expansion every year, and if you do the math against where we are today to the $945 million, it implies a little bit of - little over half of those cost savings need to go to expand margins. The other chunk of it can go back into the business to reinvest to grow the brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Growe","Anthony, you outlined $12 million in cost, I think it was related to the Ohio facility. I want to understand in the first quarter, if you were to add up to the Ohio costs or the incremental freight cost, the hurricane cost, could you give a number for what the totality of those costs were? And then as you offset that, obviously, marketing was little lower, was that the main offset to that incremental costs in the quarter?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, that's pretty close. I think if you look at the $0.13 decline in EPS and back out taxes and currency, you've got a $0.17 decline. Of that $0.17 decline, $0.04 is revenue recognition, $0.03 is Findlay. The hurricane did not really have a significant impact when all is said and done. And then the balance of it which is $0.10 are combination of the gross margin pressure, the lower organic sales, partly offset by the reduction in advertising and consumer spending is how you get there.","Chris Growe","And did you say, how much the advertising, just that piece that was down in the quarter?","Anthony DiSilvestro","No, I think in the press release, we say, we're up 13 selling and marketing and 28 points of that increase is the acquisition. So we're down double digits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ken Goldman","When you talk on Slide 5 about your plan to stabilize soup, there's some, I think low hanging fruit there that are the right moves in terms of price gaps and merchandising and so forth. But what I think it\u2019s still to me not apparent in the plan is how you will drive consumers to get more excited by and interested in your core soup product? Reason I'm saying that is the only innovation I see here is on the Well Yes!, sipping soup side, which is not that big of a product, right?","And then on Slide 23, you talk about everyone want what's next, so there's not a single product in the next column, that's a core Campbell Soup or Chunky product also. So I guess, what I'm trying to figure out what is the plan to spark sustained consumer interest in the core Campbell Soup red and white can as well as Chunky, any help there would be, I think very useful?","Keith McLoughlin","Sure. It's good question. Of course, you have - at the end of the day, what we're going to get paid for in soup is relevant consumer innovation. So you're right on target with the question. We've got to bring more relevant innovation at a faster rate to consumers. We're going to do that in a couple of ways.","One is a big theme, as you know is focus, right. How do we focus on those core brands, those core categories, where we have strength, where we got more competition. And so the redeploy or deploy the R&D dollars against those key categories. It's going to be in areas like convenience.","It's going to be in areas like meal preparation, right. How do you deal - how do you take away that 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM nightmare that happens in every household, like what's for dinner, it's going to be in healthy and vegetables, cooking - leveraging our cooking expertise, right and helping people deal with that timeframe to say here's an easy way to take some chicken or salmon and with this ingredients, with these capabilities make a healthy meal for your family. So it's going to be in those areas.","Actually we've got lots of neat stuff happening, I'm very excited to get together with you all during Investor Day to show you some of the stuff that Roberto and his team have under the hood there, but it's not yet ready for prime time, but your point is well made and well taken, it's - we're going to paid for relevant innovations, that could bring excitement back into the category.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","I guess I had a similar question as Ken did, but it was specifically about millennials. I thought, I remember 3 months ago that there was going to be a more concerted effort to target younger consumers with the Campbell brand and specifically in cooking. And I didn't see much here in terms of how you're doing that maybe your answer is the same wait until the Analyst Day.","But then secondly, what I did see in the market a lot, was a lot of 10 for 10 - 10 cans of condensed soup for $10, what was the decision to go back to that, in the past I've heard that the Company really didn't want to discount that deeply in condensed, is that changing now?","Keith McLoughlin","Yes, I would say actually to your first part of your question around the millennials, we are - probably maybe you haven't seen yet, but we started in the last two weeks of October, a new campaign to buy condensed specifically against millennials and especially to show millennials, how to take the Campbell's condensed soup and use it for meal preparation.","So you remember exactly correctly and actually the new campaign is right on that specific target segment with that featured benefit that you mentioned. In terms of the actual promotion, I can't speak the detail. I don't know, Anthony, if you have an experience on the 10 for one?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, I mean, historically, our issue on 10 for 10 has been on our RTF , right, more though and that's what we wanted to get away from we have, it's not unusual to see 10 for 10 on some of the condensed side of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Strycula from UBS. Your line is open.","Steve Strycula","Quick question, on the gross margin piece what Anthony, what builds the confidence for the second half margin recovery on the gross margin rate maybe speak to what inflation assumptions are some of the headwinds that kind of dissipate? And then a quick follow-on would be on the international snacking piece, is that about a $1.2 billion revenue entity was call it $230 million of EBITDA, just some parameters would be helpful? Thanks.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, so on the gross margin point. Obviously, we're down in the first quarter, there is some unusual things in there 60 basis points related to Findlay, 50 basis points on revenue recognition from higher trade on U.S. soup, cost inflation is running in that 4% to 5% range as we expected. Key drivers being steel, wheat, vegetables, dairy and resins. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we do expect improving trends, right.","There is a number of reasons for that. First is the accounting change, the revenue recognition is a bad guy in the first half is a positive in the second half. Second and this is an important one, we're going to wrap the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance end of March. So it turns from a being dilutive mix impact to a positive contributor to organic margin expansion.","Third, we have communicated to our customers pricing actions that we're taking in a number of brands and is - these will go into effect in the second half have some impact and certainly have more impact as we move into 2020. Also we'll start to wrap some of the more significant inflation, so that should moderate a little bit.","And as I said earlier on the call, our ongoing 3% productivity program, there's a little back-end loaded this year relative to other. So those are the four or five things that give us confidence that these trends will improve throughout the year. And on your other question, you're - I think you're right on the international sales. We're not going to break down the EBITDA at that level given where we are in these divestiture processes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar","Just two quick things, one, I think on the last call you talked about U.S. soup probably worth about 1 point of a decline for the full year in total Company sales. I want to get a sense if that was still around what you were thinking?","And then second, I'm just trying to square your comments from an earlier question around reinvesting maybe a little less than half of sort of the savings over the period of time back into the business. Were there some comments last quarter where you weren't necessarily, you didn't sound that you were expecting a significant reinvestment more of a reallocation from some brands to more disproportionate spending on some others, I wanted to make sure I just understood how to square those two comments? Thank you.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, so on the sales part of it. Yes. So U.S. soup performance, we do expect soup sales will be down on a year of probably worth comes to a point to total company sales. The other headwind that we're facing is that the two major private label fresh soup customers moving to in-sourcing that will have a negative impact as we go through the year.","In terms of the reinvestment, Andrew, I think if you just look at our - like, I said, if you look at our EBIT versus our sales, long-term algorithm is worth about 50 basis points, and that 50 basis point is about $60 million to $70 million of incremental EBIT every year.","And then if you just work out the math on the program to go in terms of the annual savings, you need a little over half of that to go to that margin expansion. Now that's a little bit simplistic because obviously you have a basket of items that are going up or down in that EBIT bridge. But I think high level, that's about what we would expect to see happen going forward.","Andrew Lazar","And Anthony around the reinvestment is a lot of it more in the marketing seeing consumer spend side or are there maybe spending that needs to be done behind capabilities in terms of what you need going forward that maybe we're less aware of?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, no, I think that's a good question, it's just probably all of the above, right, I mean, it's not just limited to one area of investment, right. You're going to increase capabilities, one way or another whether in technology, or in people, or in brands, or in products. So yes, we've talked about this before and things like digital and e-commerce, we have been stepping up our level of investment and we'll continue to do.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney","Just wanted to ask a question on the gross margin, I guess, a related issue, which is the affordability. When I look at the 2-year progress, 1-year progress in gross margin even backing out the acquisition impact, it now compares unfavorably to I think a lot of your peers directly. And juxtapose that with the conversation about affordability, I guess I just wonder me looking at the data, I wonder how much of the issue is affordability per se and where is that data coming from? Is that the consumer, the retailer that's telling you that the products aren't affordable, particularly I assume that relate largely to the meals business and soup specifically.","So I guess where's that data coming from? And are you confident that gross margins have bottomed and are going up from here on an organic basis you're setting aside whatever effect of the planned divestitures might have? Thank you very much.","Keith McLoughlin","Yes, I might need you to say a little bit more about the affordability part of the question, but just kind of generally relative to gross margins. Of course as our gross margins as you stated have been compressed here in the last couple of years, primarily driven by the under the performance in Sea Fresh and the major issue we've had with a major customer in soup. I mean that's a not insignificant challenge to our margins. And as we're stating and as you're seeing, we're starting to see getting traction, we are divesting the Sea Fresh side.","And then in soup, it looks like we're getting traction both with a key customer and also in general. So that gives us confidence, we'll get the cost that work, we'll get the synergies from Snyder's-Lance, get their gross margins back closer to where Pepperidge Farm's are and that combination gives us confidence that the gross margin will expand. Would you had another question around affordability, I just want to make sure I get the question?","Operator","And it actually looks like the caller has disconnected.","Keith McLoughlin","Okay.","Operator","So that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Keith McLoughlin for any closing remarks.","Keith McLoughlin","Okay. Thank you, and thanks, everyone. I just - a couple of concluding remarks, hopefully, you can kind of get the little bit of the picture here that there are changes happening at Campbell's. We're in a turnaround and we're executing against the plan we laid out on August 30.","We're pleased that the first quarter results give us the ability to reaffirm guidance for the full year. We're getting traction, we're seeing early signs of progress for the turnaround, but there is still a ton of work in front of us. So we are by no means declaring victory, this is the beginning - this is the beginning of the turnaround with the Campbell Soup Company.","Thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to reporting to you back on Q2 earnings call. Have a great day, and for those in the U.S., a very Happy Thanksgiving. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect.

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Call for Campbell Soup's Fiscal 2016. With me on the call are Denise Morrison, President and CEO and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO.","As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation.

Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.","Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2017's earnings dates. We plan to release earnings on November 22, 2016, February 17, 2017, May 19, 2017 and August 31, 2017.","With that, let me turn the call over to Denise.","Denise Morrison","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I'll offer my perspective on our performance with a focus on how each of our divisions are performing against their portfolio roles.","We finished the year in line with our guidance and with strong profit performance. However, our results this quarter certainly did not meet my expectations. I am particularly unhappy with the short-term executional issues that have led to the poor performance in Campbell Fresh, both for the quarter and for the year. I'll spend the majority of my time this morning addressing this topic.","While sales for the year, including Garden Fresh Gourmet, were up 5%, organic sales declined 4% in C-Fresh. In the fourth quarter, organic sales were down 12%, driven by declines in both CPG and Farms. This performance is unacceptable. I expect far more from the Campbell Fresh business. It's clear that we have several immediate challenges in Campbell Fresh, and we are addressing them. I'll get to that in a moment. ","But first, I want to step back and look at the big picture. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 is the first year of operation of Campbell Fresh. This division, which accounts for approximately $1 billion in revenue or about 13% of our total sales, combines Bolthouse Farms, the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our refrigerated soup business. Strategically, C-Fresh positions Campbell to benefit from the growing health and well-being trend as well as the growing demand for better-for-you foods in the Packaged Fresh category. Its portfolio role is to deliver full-force growth, driven by the CPG business and to contribute to the acceleration of Campbell's overall sales trajectory. ","While disappointed in our execution, I remain confident in our C-Fresh strategy. We have strong popular brands that are on trend with the changing nature of consumers' eating habits. We're well positioned in the produce and deli section of stores with an eye on expansion into other categories such as dairy. We have a robust innovation pipeline, and we're enhancing our approach to long-term innovation. Strategy was not the issue. Our problem was execution. ","I'm going to spend some time on what didn't work, and importantly, the actions we're taking to ensure the business performs to its potential. So, what went wrong? There were two issues that were the primary drivers of the C-Fresh result in the quarter. The Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS recall and the poor performance of our carrot business. ","Let's start with our CPG business and the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage. As previously announced on June 22, we voluntarily recalled 3.8 million bottles of Bolthouse Farms' Protein PLUS beverages due to possible spoilage. The Protein PLUS lineup accounts for approximately 15% of the Bolthouse Farms' beverage business. In addition, the same manufacturing lines are used to produce our caf\u00e9 drinks, which account for another 10% of the beverage business. ","Our examination into the recall identified our manufacturing equipment and process, as the primary cause of the spoilage. We have corrected these problems, rigorously tested the product and started shipping again. However, production has not returned to the pre-recall levels due to new operating procedures that we've put in place, including an enhanced test and release protocol to ensure the product meets our high quality standards. ","Prior to the recall, a typical production run for these products would have been 72 hours. Today, our production run is 24 hours. Unfortunately, the shorter run significantly reduced our capacity. We were examining various ways to increase capacity, including commissioning other production lines, but we currently anticipate these will take time to implement and expect that supply will be impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016.","Now, turning to Farms. Let's take a look at our second issue, our carrot business. In July, at our Investor Day, we discussed some weather-related problems and a customer issue in our carrot business. As we review these issues further, we learned the problems were rooted in several decisions that had compounded one and another, and therefore were broader than we understood at the time. Specifically, there were some planting, harvesting and commercial decisions made earlier in the calendar year that exacerbated the weather problems. This led our farm's operation to harvest carrots prematurely in an attempt to meet customer demand. ","Ultimately, this resulted in a spring crop that yielded smaller carrots, which led to customer dissatisfaction and an additional loss of business. The size of the carrots we're harvesting now is vastly improved, and we're actively addressing service issues with customers. However, it will take us time to regain the lost business. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2017 carrot sales to be comparable to fiscal 2016, rather than benefiting from a recovery from last year's issues.","A final point of context. Carrots are a relatively low-margin business. However, it serves as the chassis for our higher-margin value-added CPG business. Carrots provide the scale for the refrigerated logistic system that we leverage for distribution and merchandising.","So what actions have we taken so far to correct these issues? Over the last several weeks, we made major organization changes under Jeff Dunn, the President of Campbell Fresh. Several senior managers are no longer with the company, including the President of Bolthouse Farms. Additionally, we created a new structure to foster more agility and collaboration across the division. ","Previously, we had two operating units, Bolthouse Farms functioned as a distinct unit and Garden Fresh Gourmet was combined with Fresh Soup. Now we have three operating units reporting directly to Jeff. CPG, which integrates Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings with Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and chips, along with fresh soups. Farms, which consist of carrots and carrot ingredients, and the long-term innovation unit we discussed at Investor Day in July. ","In addition to the three operating units, we have created a more integrated structure both at the divisional level and with Campbell. In particular, we have strengthened the integration and oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain.","We have also bolstered the Campbell Fresh leadership team by adding more senior finance, human resources and sales executives. This new team is a combination of seasoned and accomplished Campbell and Bolthouse Farms leaders and experienced executives recruited from food start-ups and major industry players. I believe that this newly structured team will lead this business back to the growth profile mandated by its portfolio role. ","In the first half of fiscal 2017, the new management team will take steps to stabilize the business. First, we expect to improve our execution. Second, we plan to continue to increase capacity as we rebound from the Protein PLUS recall and related production outage. And third, we'll stabilize the carrot business through improved quality and customer service.","Our plans call for C-Fresh sales to be down slightly in the first half and return to growth consistent with its portfolio role in the second half. Putting it all together, we expect sales growth to be in the low-single digits for fiscal '17, and we will keep you updated on developments as we go.","While disappointed in the near-term performance of C-Fresh, I remain confident in the strategy we are pursuing, the Packaged Fresh platform we're building and the growth potential of this business.","Now, let me shift gears to the progress we've made in other areas during fiscal 2016. As I said earlier, when I look at the year as a whole for the company, our profit performance was strong. This was driven by our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions. We delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth with solid operating performance, including expanded gross margin, significantly improved supply chain performance and better-than-expected cost savings. ","We also advanced our real food and transparency agenda, establishing Campbell as a leader in this area. However, we continue to face challenges on the top line. We recognize that we need to grow sales, and it remains a top priority. Our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions have performed largely in line with their portfolio roles.","First, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. Things are moving in the right direction here, and I feel good about what we've achieved this year. We made important strides in fiscal 2016. The team drove significant gross margin expansion through a combination of net price realization and major improvements in our supply chain. This resulted in a 13% increase in operating profit. Our Simple Meals brands delivered sales growth behind Prego and Pace, and Plum delivered double-digit sales gains through increased distribution and innovation. And we advanced our Real Food agenda, changing many of our recipes, including clean label products and embracing transparency.","While we've accomplished much in the Americas divisions, sales remained inconsistent. Organic sales declined 1% for the year. Many of our brands are performing in line with the categories in which we compete. However, portions of the portfolio are underperforming their categories, in particular beverages and ready-to-serve soup. We're taking steps to address this and expect improved performance in these areas and modest growth in the division in fiscal '17. ","Looking ahead, the Americas division will continue to concentrate on getting more from our core brands with a focus on driving sales through investments in fewer bigger innovations and improved marketing while increasing margins. We have plans in place to drive continued margin expansion through supply chain efficiencies.","In fiscal 2017, we expect our soup business to grow behind continued growth of broth and better performance from our ready-to-serve soup portfolio. As we outlined at Investor Day, our plans call for improved execution around the Chunky brand and the midyear launch of the new Well Yes clean label soup line. We also anticipate better performance from V8 beverages, driven by the continued success of Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy as well as a renewed focus on tried-and-tested marketing that reengages our loyal V8 Red consumers. To connect with our consumers, build brand relevance and drive demand, we're investing in four integrated marketing campaigns in the Americas, including a new NFL team Chunky campaign featuring six popular players.","For the year, our Global Biscuits and Snacks division made progress in performing against its portfolio role. Organic sales increased 1%, and operating earnings were up 10%. Pepperidge Farm delivered strong performance, and our Asia Pacific team drove solid sales results in a highly competitive and concentrated trading environment. The emphasis on growing our icon brands Goldfish, Tim Tam and Milano, as well as revenue management initiatives and improved supply chain performance, drove our results. ","Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering the division's role of expanding in both developed and developing markets while improving margins. In the United States, we have higher levels of investment to drive sustained Goldfish growth, continued momentum for Milano, expanded Tim Tam distribution and increased innovation in our fresh bakery business. In Australia, we're focused on strengthening our Arnott's brand through integrated marketing and relevant consumer-driven innovation. In developing markets, we expect continued growth in Malaysia and improved performance in China and Indonesia.","Looking forward to 2017, I have a pragmatic outlook. Our plan calls for modest growth, driven by reinvesting some of our cost savings back into the business. We're confident in the C-Fresh platform, and we're acting with urgency to address our execution to get the beverage and carrot business back on track while continuing to drive sales on salad dressing, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and fresh soup. We expect Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks to continue to live into their portfolio roles. ","We remain focused on delivering our three-year cost-savings target, and we are looking for more opportunities to drive effectiveness and efficiency. We'll be reinvesting a portion of our cost savings in focused innovation and improved marketing on our core business, and we're creating an ownership mindset across the organization through our zero-based budgeting efforts. These are reflected in our annual guidance, which Anthony will take you through in a few minutes.","Clearly, we have some challenges ahead of us, but we know what's working and what's not. And we're taking action to improve our sales performance in every division. I remain confident in the strategic imperatives that we're pursuing and that they provide a compelling path to increase shareholder value. Reflecting confidence in our growth prospects and the strong profit performance this year, our Board of Directors declared a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend.","Thank you. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I want to provide my perspective on our results and guidance. As Denise stated, we are disappointed with the performance of our C-Fresh division in the fourth quarter, which was the key driver of a 1% decline in organic sales for the company, reflecting the recall of Bolthouse Farms protein drink and declines in carrot. At the EBIT line, the negative impact of the C-Fresh performance was offset by lower incentive compensation accrual relative to our expectations. ","In the fourth quarter, our adjusted tax rate was negatively impacted by a $13 million correction for deferred taxes. The correction had a negative impact on EPS of $0.04 per share. And as a result, our full year tax rate finished above our previous expectations.","Moving on to the full year. While adjusted EPS of $2.94 was within our guidance range, we finished at the lower end due to the tax correction. We're pleased with our gross margin performance, which, on an adjusted basis, increased by 170 basis points, in line with the expectations, driven by significantly improved supply chain performance, cost savings and net price realization. We continue to make very good progress against our three-year cost-savings target of $300 million, delivering about $130 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2016, bringing the program to-date total to $215 million.","As part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $0.41 per share in our GAAP results on our Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredient business, reflecting reduced expectations for future cash flows. I'm very pleased with our strong cash flow performance as cash from operations exceeded $1.4 billion, and our board has approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, although below our long-term target, we plan to improve our sales performance compared to 2016 and make investments in the business to support key brand, launch new products, drive long-term innovation and build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce.","Now, I'll review our detail -- sorry, our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis of $1.687 billion were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation and the favorable impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. The negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage was approximately 1 percentage point on total company sales. ","Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $253 million as higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses and a lower gross margin percentage were partly offset by lower administrative expenses, reflecting lower incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted EPS decreased 6% or $0.03 to $0.46. This EPS decline includes a $0.03 per share negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage, consistent with our expectation, as well as a $0.04 per share negative impact from the tax correction.","For the full year, as reported and organic net sales both decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1.467 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.94 both increased by 11%. Earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and a benefit from our cost-savings initiatives.","Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Net sales was comparable to prior year. Organic sales declined 1% as a 2-point negative impact from higher promotional spending was partly offset by a 1-point gain from volume and mix. Gains in volume were driven by growth in Arnott\u2019s biscuits, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and Prego pasta sauces, which benefited from the launch of the new Prego Farmers' Market product line, partly offset by declines in C-Fresh due to the Bolthouse Farms\u2019 protein drinks recall and volume decline in carrot. ","Increased promotional spending across our three segments includes higher spending in Arnott's, as we're lapping in an unusually low quarter, which was impacted by product availability, higher spending in Bolthouse Farms to remain competitive and support the launch of 1915 and higher spending on Prego and Taste. With the exception of C-Fresh, increased promotional spending drove gains in volume. Completing the bridge, a 1-point negative impact from currency translation was offset by the 1-point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet.","Our gross margin declined 90 basis points in the quarter to 36.1%. Looking at the drivers of this decline, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 270 basis points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which, on a rate basis, increased by about 1.5%, the recall and related production outages of Bolthouse Farms protein drinks and higher carrot cost from unfavorable crop yields. ","Reflecting the increased promotional spending on the businesses I mentioned in the sales discussion, the higher promotional rate had a negative impact of 110 basis points on gross margin. This was partly offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points from previous pricing actions in Global Biscuits and Snacks. Mix was slightly favorable, also adding 20 basis points. ","Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our three-year cost-savings program, contributed 250 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. Looking at this another way, not on the chart, the weak performance of the Campbell Fresh segment accounted for 70 basis points of the total decline of 90 basis points, including the protein drink recall, which accounted for 50 basis points.","Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased [ph] 14% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses in Pepperidge Farm to support Goldfish crackers and the fresh bakery business and increased support of Prego pasta sauces. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 19%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation cost, which account for about two-thirds of the decline, as well as the benefit from our cost-savings initiatives.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.03 from $0.49 in the prior year to $0.46 per share in the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, declines in adjusted EBIT had a negative impact on EPS of $0.01. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter increased by 2.3 points to 36.4%. The increase in the tax rate reduced the EPS by $0.02, as the impact of the deferred tax correction was partly offset by the benefit of geographic mix. ","The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but due to rounding, shows no benefit on EPS in the quarter. Interest was fairly comparable to prior year, up $1 million, with no impact on EPS as the impact of higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio was mostly offset by lower debt level. Currency translation also had no impact, completing the bridge to $0.46 per share.","Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to prior year at $842 million, driven by double-digit gains in Prego pasta sauces, including the benefit of the launch of Prego Farmers' Market and also by double-digit gains in Plum products, offset by declines in V8 beverages and ready-to-serve soup. Operating earnings increased 4%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement, partly offset by increased marketing expenses, as we've increased support behind Prego and V8 beverages.","Within U.S. soup, which declined 2% in aggregate, condensed declined 1% and RTS declined 6%. These declines were partly offset by a 7% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact soup sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, while we will discuss the key drivers of soup performance as we do with our other businesses, this is the last quarter we will provide detailed subcategory sales performance.","Here is a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending July 31, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.7%. Our sales in measured channels declined 3.8%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, declining 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 10 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29%, up 60 basis points, reflecting share gains by smaller brands.","In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with double-digit gains in Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers, supported by increased advertising and growth in Arnott\u2019s biscuits in Australia and New Zealand, driven by increased promotional activity. Operating earnings increased 5% to $81 million, as lower administrative costs were partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Within gross margin, the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvement.","In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 12%, reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages due to the recall of protein drinks. Sales of the CPG beverages and salad dressings businesses declined 10% in the quarter. Sales of carrots also declined as we experienced quality issues in the fourth quarter which led to customer dissatisfaction and the loss of business. These declines were partly offset by gains in fresh soup. Operating earnings declined by $13 million or 62% to $8 million, primarily driven by the adverse impact of the voluntary recall on Bolthouse Farms protein drink and related production outages as well as higher carrot cost and lower sales of carrots and carrot ingredient, partly offset by lower administrative expenses. Just a reminder, the Garden Fresh Gourmet was acquired on June 29, 2015, and we have now wrapped the acquisition date. As a result, there is 1 month of operating results from Garden Fresh Gourmet now included in organic sales.","We had very strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2016. Cash from operations increased by $281 million to a record $1,463,000,000, driven by significantly higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirement, reflecting reductions in inventory level. Capital expenditures declined $39 million to $341 million. We paid dividends totaling $390 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. And as announced this morning, we will be increasing our quarterly dividend by 12% to $0.35 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $143 million of shares in fiscal 2016, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by $592 million, as cash from operations was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividend and share repurchases.","Now I'll review our 2017 outlook. The company expects sales to grow by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3.00 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rates, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. While not to the level of our long-term sales growth target of 1% to 3%, sales performance is expected to improve relative to 2016, as we address those businesses which have underperformed. While we expect to achieve further EBIT margin expansion in 2017, growth in adjusted EBIT is slightly below our long-term target, as we will be making investments in our business to support key brands, in new product launches, in long-term innovation and to build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce. These investments are designed to improve our growth profile over the long term. Our range for growth in adjusted EPS is ahead of EBIT, as we plan to increase share repurchases and benefit from a slightly lower tax rate, partly offset by slightly higher interest expense, given our expectation of rising short-term interest rates. While we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect the majority of our top and bottom line growth to come in the second half, as we work through the issues we're currently experiencing in C-Fresh and as we wrap lower levels of marketing support in the first half of fiscal 2016.","Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance, while inflation on core ingredients and packaging has moderated, we expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2%, including higher wage and ongoing benefit cost and a lagging negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses, given the timing of our foreign currency hedges. As we've successfully delivered in the past, we expect ongoing supply chain productivity gains, excluding our ZBB initiative of approximately 3% of cost of products sold. We expect our gross margin percentage to improve slightly with productivity gains exceeding inflation. The effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 32%, slightly below the 2016 adjusted rate of 32.6%. While we are not prepared to provide a specific amount, we currently plan to significantly increase share repurchases, unless needed for other uses including M&A. Our EPS guidance reflects the favorable impact of these anticipated repurchases over the course of the year on our average shares outstanding. We are forecasting capital expenditures of approximately $350 million comparable to fiscal 2016 levels and in line with our historical spending level. And under our cost-savings program, we expect to deliver incremental savings of $50 million in fiscal 2017 and are on track to achieve our $300 million goal by 2018.","That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time and fairness to the other callers, please ask only one question at a time. Okay, Stephanie.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","I wanted to get a bit of a better understanding of the carrots business longer-term from here. I do understand, Denise, that there were some execution issues. I think that indicates that, perhaps, a lot of the problem is fixable. You also talked about carrot yield, which suggest that's fixable, too. On the other hand, you just took a big write-down, and I would look at that as maybe an indication that the business is never going to be as strong as it once was, or at least in management's mind. So I really just wanted to get a better sense of maybe how to balance those 2 data points, I guess, as we think about, not just 2017, but beyond for the carrot business.","Denise Morrison","Yes. I think that, as we indicated, the carrot business is right now going through a short-term issue. And fortunately, it is a short-term crop, and the crop we're harvesting now is much better. So we believe we will be back in business at pretty normal levels by about the second half of the year. We've got a lot of to do there. I mean, we've got customer issues to address, and we are actively doing that. Going forward, I think, as we look at the business, based on the growth rates in sales and earnings that we saw when we bought the business, we believe that the growth rates are going to be about flat to up slightly. And that's a -- that is a little bit more conservative than when we first bought the business.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, if I could just add to that. As part of our annual testing of intangible assets, which we perform in the fourth quarter, we do a detailed discounted cash flow analysis. And as we performed that on the carrot and carrot ingredient reporting unit, we certainly reflected the current year performance and our expectations for future cash flows. And while we expect the performance to improve over time, it's not to the levels previously anticipated and consequently led to the impairment charge.","Ken Goldman","Okay. That makes sense. Can I just ask a quick follow-up? Denise, you mentioned, and maybe I heard you wrong that you wanted to get C-Fresh into other areas. And I think you mentioned dairy. I always thought the goal was maybe to get into dairy alternatives, not necessarily dairy itself. I'm just curious if there was a change at all in your thinking there.","Denise Morrison","Yes. Ken, that actually is related to what we talked about in Investor Day with -- our -- in our long-term innovation group working on the new pea protein beverage, so it's plant-based beverages, but they would be situated in the dairy part of the perimeter of the store.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Just a follow-up on Campbell Fresh. I guess, as we look at Bolthouse going into 2017, just 2 points, I guess, I'd like to get some clarification on. First, in terms of the profitability there for this year, I guess, it sounds like it will be somewhat impaired or below what a normal run rate would be as you sort of rebuild your production capacity and you get rebuild the customer base in carrot. I just want to make sure that that's one of the things that will hold it back this year, maybe relative to what we should expect in '18 and '19, is just simply there is a little bit of rebuilding that has to go on. And then as a follow-up to that, just -- does the sort of adjustments you're making in production runs and run times sounds like maybe even considering new production lines, does that at all slow the pace of new product innovations like the pea protein drinks? And just trying to understand if whether there is sort of a step back before you can step forward as you get the supply chain straightened up.","Anthony DiSilvestro","Bryan, the first part of that question, Denise mentioned 2 factors that'll impact at least our first half performance in 2017. One is the supply constraints on protein drinks, given the production, the run times, 24 hours versus 72. And the other thing is given some loss of customers on carrots; it'll take a little bit of time to reacquire that business. And so as we look at C-Fresh for the full year, we expect top line growth, low single digit. Typically, we would look for high single digit, so obviously, that's impacting our 2017 outlook. And as far as innovation, I don't think the issue on this particular line has an impact on our innovation agenda.","Denise Morrison","It does not. I would say, though, in the first half, the team will be very focused on the fundamentals, so the new product innovations will most likely go to market in the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask a little bit about the cost savings and the reinvestment strategy. So kind of back at the beginning, I think, Denise, the plan was to take about half of the big cost savings that were coming in and reinvest it back in the business. But then you had to spend like wonderful event of the cost savings tumbled in faster, larger, all these good things have happened in the year, but it brought up the question as to when would all these reinvestment occur? So if we're still looking for something like a $150 million of reinvestment, will most of that occur in fiscal '17? Or can you give us some guidance on how the reinvestment plan lays out?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I think that's right, Dave. So when we first announced the cost saving program, we're targeting $200 million in savings, and we talked about half of that going back for reinvestment. I think as the savings level went up, as when we kind of help the reinvestment amount, so I don't think we're -- we'd estimate that. I think I'd estimate less than half is not going back in the business. We're not going to give a specific dollar amount in terms of reinvestment in 2017, but it is significant, and it is in a number of areas. We're going to support new product launches, things like Prego's Farmers' market, Well Yes soup, Plum infant formula, the Bolthouse spring innovations, Tim Tam's expansion in the U.S., Goldfish made with organic wheat. So we have a number of product launches going on.","We're also going to invest in new capabilities around things like digital and e-commerce. We're going to make investments in our Real Food initiative, so these are things like improving our can liners, continuing the removal of BPA, improving the product and more clean label, those types of ingredients which tend to be more expensive. We're going to invest in longer term innovation, things like our Acre investment fund, and also Denise mentioned, long-term innovation in Packaged Fresh. We're also going to invest and add resources to expand our sales and distribution in China through our Kelsen business. So we have quite a list of areas we're looking to reinvest and in the P&L, we have a significant allocation of fund.","Denise Morrison","And David, our profit is strong. Our challenge is top line growth. So these investments are really vital to long-term health of the sales line of the company.","David Driscoll","So it sounds like it's fair to say that a big portion of the investment is happening now but will also happen in F'18 and beyond. I think that's what you're trying to tell me. Is that right, guys?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Well, certainly, F'17. I'm not commenting on F'18 at this point, but...","David Driscoll","All right. One clarification and apologies for this, but I got to ask this. The pacing of the quarterly earnings so -- there was amazing growth in Q1 and Q2. You didn't really say this in your prepared comments, Anthony, but will you actually be at or above the year-ago 1Q and 2Q numbers? I mean is there any chance that these are below those year ago numbers just because of how tremendous the Q1 and Q2 were last year?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Well, we did said the majority of growth will come in the second half. And as you point out, there's 2 reasons for that. We are lapping a relatively low marketing Q1, Q2, and we have these lingering issues on C-Fresh. So that will tend to suppress our first half performance, but we'll see it come back in the second half.","Denise Morrison","Yes. We have a much stronger marketing investment in the first half, particularly in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage with 4 really big campaigns.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","I've got 2 quick questions. First, I'm not really sure what you meant when you answered Dave Driscoll question in terms of cadence. So I'll ask a little more directly. Do you expect earnings to be down year-on-year in the first half the year?","Anthony DiSilvestro","We're not going to give specific guidance, but I would say, we expect relatively weaker performance in the first half and stronger performance in the second half.","Jason English","Okay. I had to try. My second question relates to promotional spend. Early last year, you guys kind of went into the year, you talked about some opportunities to rationalize expense. There were glimmers of hope to the first half of the year as that promotional line in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division actually went positive, given that back in the back half of the year. So can you kind of update us on how you're thinking about your promotional posture, your promotional spend? And what caused the set back as we progress through the year?","Anthony DiSilvestro","I guess we'll look at it a little bit different than that. We are very focused on improving our gross margin performance and expanding margin. Within that, we looked at net price realization, productivity improvements to exceed inflation. On the net price realization, we feel really good about what we've been able to accomplish in 2016. In fact, 40 basis points of our 170 basis point gross margin improvement is driven by net price realization. And within that, and I guess a little distorted on the sales variance, but we've made meaningful reductions in trade spend in soup given the promotional pricing we've taken on RTS.","And although it's impacted volumes, it has contributed significantly to margin expansion. Now we're up a little bit in the fourth quarter. It's a non-seasonal quarter for us. Most of our dollar increase in trade in the fourth quarter relates to our Arnott's business in Australia, kind of lapping a period of supply constraints, so we had to pull back on our promotional activity, so we're wrapping that. But as I look at the whole year, we accomplished what we set out to do in our plan and have made meaningful progress, especially in soup, which is very critical to our agenda going forward.","Denise Morrison","Let me build on that, that we also, as part of the setup of our Integrated Global Services have made investments in our revenue management and advanced analytics. And we're continuing to look for ways to manage the depth and frequency of our trade programs to maximize profitable volume. We have to take into consideration competitive activity and customer programs and consumer response, but this is definitely a point of focus for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Connor","This is actually Robert Connor on for Rob Moskow. So we just had a question. So it looks like some of these smaller organic brands are more vulnerable to weather disruptions and kind of like the stability of the product on the shelf is shorter. It seems like WhiteWave with their Earthbound Farms brand and supply chain issues, and obviously, you guys are having issues kind of with the Bolthouse brand supply chain. So did it raise any concerns in your mind about kind of putting most of your growth in the fresh part, which has kind of more volatile supply chain and lower margins?","Denise Morrison","It all starts with the consumer, and the consumer trends are very strong in terms of health and well-being, and particularly in fresh food. Some of these issues are part and parcel to running a fresh food business. But in our case, these were execution issues, and we can do better there. So we're really confident in the strategy to pursue fresh food in addition to the strong core brands that we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","Anthony, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the inflation outlook and apologies if I missed this earlier. But did you mention what inflation was here in the fourth quarter? The gross margin headwind in the step up quite a bit versus what we've seen year-to-date. So I'm not sure how material the other portion of that was related to Bolthouse issues. And if you could give us any color on kind of the shape of the inflation curve, as we kind of move forward sequentially?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Sure. I think the best way to explain our gross margin performance was it was down 90 basis points in the fourth quarter is to parse out the impact of the C-Fresh division. So the C-Fresh division in aggregate had a 70 basis point impact out of the 90 basis point, so basically most of our gross margin decline is attributable to the 2 issues inside of C-Fresh, the recall, which was 50 basis points, and the decline on carrots, which has a -- an impact on the margin as well. And looking at the rest of it, inflation was not that great in the fourth quarter as we talked in the bridge. The higher promotional expense was the key swing relative to prior quarters. But most of the decline, as we said, attributable to the C-Fresh performance.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, that helps. Thanks. And just one other quick clarification from a guidance standpoint. Incentive, obviously, you've delivered an 11% underlying EPS growth this year, but there was, I guess, perhaps, an accrual correction on incentive comp here in the fourth quarter, which resulted in a year-on-year decline there. As we've kind of think ahead to 2017, does incentive comp end up being a headwind or a tailwind? Are you kind of essentially at a low normal run rate at this point?","Anthony DiSilvestro","Yes, so we had some ups and downs obviously in 2016. We ended up with a $0.02 headwind in '16 versus '15. And looking forward, our short-term incentives are close to target. The long-term incentive will go up a little bit. All in, we had about a $0.02 negative impact in 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John Baumgartner","Denise, I'd like to ask about M&A. In addition to the chassis, you feel that you have with the carrot basis, it also seems you have a fairly nice chassis with your distribution model at Pepperidge. So how do you assess the ability for M&A to maybe accelerate growth more broadly in U.S. snacking? Maybe even outside of C-Fresh. And how much more could you be doing at Pepperidge to leverage your route to market there?","Denise Morrison","Yes. I wanted to clarify that. We look at -- we do look at M&A more broadly than just Campbell Fresh. And each one of our divisions has mapped out specific targets that they're interested in, that are a good strategic fit for their businesses. And so we are highly interested in other consumer behaviors like health and well-being, like snacking, like simple meals that we can pursue not only from an organic growth standpoint but also from an M&A standpoint.","John Baumgartner","And you feel like your route to market with the DSD at Pepperidge allows you to kind of go and do that and accelerate growth with kind of a bolt-on?","Denise Morrison","I'm sorry. I didn't understand the question.","John Baumgartner","Do you feel though your route to market at Pepperidge through kind of the DSD network would allow you to kind of buy a smaller additional brands, just more on health and wellness space and really kind of accelerate?","Denise Morrison","Yes, absolutely. I mean, Plum Organics is a great example of a smaller brand that we bought. We were able to integrate that into the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage business and capitalize on things like their sales force and supply chain.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer","A question on a couple areas that I know you'd like to improve and that was ready-to-serve soup and Chunky in particular and then also V8. Your new marketing campaign for Chunky, it looked promising and your comparisons will be on your side. Realistically speaking, do you think that that's the business that has the best chance for improvement among the areas that you cited that you think will improve in fiscal '17? And then perhaps, you can dimensionalize what you think would be a successful step and the right direction, could get you back to flat for that business in ready-to-serve, for instance?","Denise Morrison","Yes. We definitely have some bright spots in soups this year. We basically stabilized condensed and broth is up for the year. But the issue we've had has been RTS soup. And as you indicate, with brand Chunky, we are -- we have the price realization behind us. We have improved Chunky marketing going into 2017. We had a label execution issue in first and second quarter last year that we are cycling. And then we can't control the weather, but that was definitely an impact in 2016. So we believe that the Chunky brand will have improved performance in 2017. In addition, we are launching Well Yes midyear, which is a great tasting, clean-label ready-to-serve soup that we believe will have disruption in the soup aisle and capture the hearts and minds of consumers. The other thing we have going for us in soup is Slow Kettle and organic soups continue to do very well. And we just came out with new stackable cans in our RTS soup, which has been received really, really well from the retailers for merchandising purposes. So we've got a lot more going for us this year than last year, and we expect soup to grow modestly.","Operator","Our final question comes from Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank.","Mario Contreras","So actually just following up on that previous -- the question, I think there was also a question on V8. So I just wanted to add onto that. So that's been an area of investment. You mentioned some further investment in terms of marketing and advertising, but sales continue to be a headwind there. So can you just talk about the results that you're seeing from some of those investments. So we had an inflection point where that's starting to improve?","Denise Morrison","Yes, and thanks for that reminder. We continue to be challenged in our shelf-stable beverages, particularly on our products that contain sugar, so V8 V-Fusion, for example. And this year we actually did have some declines on our V8 Red. Our new Veggie Blends, which we supported with some good marketing support, continue to grow. And our V8 +Energy is growing really nicely. What we have done is, we've developed a brand-new campaign, but also we've increased our support around our V8 Red juice. So instead of just promoting the new parts of the business, we're going back to better balancing our marketing against the core V8 Red as well as the new Veggie Blends and the V8 +Energy. And we believe that, that is a much better formula for success. We don't expect beverages to grow next year, but we do expect improved performance.","Mario Contreras","Okay. And just a clarification, I think going back to the -- to your Analyst Day, you mentioned something about shifting some consumers from V-Fusion to Veggie Blends. Should we read into that, that you're looking for V-Fusion to eventually maybe not be eliminated, but just become much less significant? Or I guess what did you mean by that specifically?","Denise Morrison","We have -- we do have top-selling varieties in the V-Fusion line such as strawberry banana or pomegranate blueberry and some others, and we'll continue to include them in the V8 line. But we -- the consumer will take us to the flavors that they like and will repeat. So that's basically how we're planning it.","Operator","And that concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to management for further remarks.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Stephanie. Thanks, everyone for joining our fourth quarter earnings call and webcast.

If you are attending the event, there will be a Campbell-sponsored luncheon immediately after our presentation.","And, with that, let me turn it over to Denise.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and provide my view on our progress across each of our three divisions. Anthony will follow with a detailed financial review.","Let's be real. I am not satisfied with our overall sales performance in the quarter. Organic sales declined 2%, with the most prominent declines in Campbell Fresh and V8 shelf-stable beverages. Additionally, in the Campbell Fresh segment, we recorded non-cash impairment charges related to the carrot and carrot ingredient and Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting units. Anthony will walk you through additional details during his comments.","There were some bright spots in the quarter, such as growth in U.S. soup, simple meals, Pepperidge Farm snacks, and fresh soup. Our adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points, all of which was achieved by Americas Simple Meals and Beverages.","Another positive result was the over-delivery of our cost-savings initiatives. As we announced this morning, we now expect to achieve our cost-savings target a year ahead of schedule. Based on the success of the program to-date and the identification of additional savings opportunities, we're raising our cost-savings target from $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018 to $450 million by the end of fiscal 2020.","Looking at the first half, organic sales declined 1%, adjusted EBIT was comparable to a year ago, and adjusted earnings per share increased 5%. With the expectation of improved sales performance in the second half of the year, we reaffirmed our full-year guidance this morning.","Now let me offer my perspective on the performance of each of our three divisions in the quarter. Let's start with the Campbell Fresh division.","The CPG segment of C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus, dips and chips and fresh soups. The Farms portion of the portfolio includes carrots and carrot ingredients.","The division's performance was below our expectations this quarter. C-Fresh is an important strategic business for Campbell, and we remain confident in the growth potential of the packaged fresh category, as consumer preferences continue to shift towards fresher and healthier foods. In fact, nearly 80% of consumers, including younger ones, are trying to eat more fresh foods. These consumers not only believe that fresh foods are cleaner, healthier and less processed, but that they also taste better.","We acquired two packaged fresh businesses: Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet with brands that resonate with consumers as a way to develop a long-term growth platform in packaged fresh CPG. The perimeter categories in which we compete are still growing significantly faster than the traditional center-store.","While category growth rates have slowed somewhat, we still believe we can build a profitable growth business, leveraging these brands, capabilities, and our scale. However, our performance over the last year in fresh has been disappointing. The reasons vary by business, which I'll explain in more detail in a minute. We've made a number of changes to address this. Most notably, we replaced the leadership team and appointed a long-time Campbell executive Ed Carolan as the President of C-Fresh in November.","I'm confident in this new seasoned leadership team, which includes Campbell executives, some newcomers to the company, and key members of the Bolthouse Farms team who possess CPG and agriculture experience as well as insight into both the operations and the entrepreneurial culture of the organization.","It's taking longer than we originally expected to regain carrot customers following last year's quality and customer service issues and to rebuild capacity following the Protein PLUS beverage recall. As a result, we no longer expect C-Fresh to grow this fiscal year.","Over the last quarter, our new team has conducted an extensive strategic review to assess the potential of this business going forward. This has helped us update our expectations about future growth based on the fresh categories in which we compete and is leading to a sharpened strategy. As a result of this work and our current-year performance, we've lowered our expectations for both long-term sales and earnings.","We've learned some tough lessons over the last several quarters and we're applying them. As a first step, we started to integrate the supply chain to reengineer the fresh operating model. We're building a stronger foundation under the Campbell Fresh business, leveraging Campbell's scale and expertise, realizing synergies, and building capacity and capabilities in order to return it to profitable growth.","Let me now take each piece of the business individually and explain. Let's start with farms and specifically the carrot business. After experiencing quality issues last year due to execution and poor weather conditions in California, we've restored our carrot quality. We've demonstrated this improved quality to customers and are working hard to earn back the lost business over time.","Our previous assumptions were too aggressive and regaining share is turning out to be more difficult than planned. In the current quarter, our carrot business faced additional challenges, again related to the weather. In California, rainfall in December and January was significantly higher than normal. This hampered our ability to harvest fields and lowered our yields on the carrots we did harvest. This negatively impacted both sales and earnings in the quarter.","Now let's turn to beverages. Last June, we voluntarily recalled our Protein PLUS beverages for quality reasons. At that time, we had a 47% market share of the protein segment and Protein PLUS was one of our strongest performing SKUs. The good news is that consumers are seeking out protein products and our Protein PLUS consumer is a loyal shopper.","As previously discussed, we implemented enhanced processes to improve the quality standards, resulting in fabulous product quality, albeit at reduced run times. Since then, we've steadily improved but have not returned to pre-recall production levels.","We've added an additional beverage line in our Bakersfield plant that we expect to be fully operational in April. As we discussed last quarter, we're seeking additional ways to increase capacity. We've had challenges in finding co-packers that meet our quality standards, but we've recently qualified a co-packer and expect to be significantly expanding our capacity by the summer.","We're able to fulfill shelf-stock and service levels back to the high 90s. In addition, we're seeing increases in velocity each period as we regain distribution. While we're selling everything we make, we have insufficient capacity to fulfill merchandising demand across the full range of our beverages.","Our plan is to re-launch Protein PLUS merchandising in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 when we expect to have sufficient supply. Due to our continued capacity constraints, we don't expect our beverage business to return to growth until the fourth quarter.","Meanwhile, we remain focused on driving innovation across the Bolthouse Farms CPG range, including dressings, spreads, and super-premium and ultra-premium beverages. We recently extended our salad dressing line with a range of four new organic varieties. We also launched a test of Bolthouse Farms MAIO, a new line of refrigerated yogurt-based spreads made with clean ingredients and fewer calories than mayonnaise.","Later this year, we plan to expand our line of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms organic, cold-pressed juice and launched Bolthouse Farms Plant Protein Milk, a higher protein alternative to almond milk. Customer response to this new product has been very positive.","Now, turning to Garden Fresh Gourmet. As a reminder, the business has four product groups: salsa, which is over half of the business; hummus, dips and chips; and fresh soup. The business offers a combination of branded and private-label products. The traits that made Garden Fresh Gourmet an attractive acquisition target, a small authentic brand with a compelling story have also presented some obstacles.","When we acquired it in June 2015, Garden Fresh Gourmet was a small operation with approximately $100 million in revenue and very little infrastructure. The integration into the Bolthouse Farms fresh platform proved to be challenging. The truth is, we expected more, faster in multiple areas of this business, including financial systems, information technology, and supply chain integration, as well as increased marketplace distribution.","Let me explain the issues we've encountered and what we're doing to fix them. Garden Fresh Gourmet branded salsa is growing strongly in consumption, and we've regained a major customer beginning January 2017. Private-label salsa is below expectations due to lost distribution with two customers. We've recently regained one of these customers and active negotiations are underway with the second.","Throughout its short history, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa was largely a Midwestern brand. Our plan called for the rapid distribution expansion of branded salsa beyond the Midwest. However, it became apparent that we did not have the differentiated recipes and taste profiles that would be accepted by consumers in other parts of the country. We now have the recipes to pursue expanded distribution.","In January, we launched branded Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa in new packaging with new regional recipes. We're focused on key distribution and velocity-building initiatives. For example, in January, we gained national distribution for new branded organic salsa with a major customer.","Today, our ACV distribution of Garden Fresh branded salsa is only 37%, so we have a lot of runway to match the 70% ACV levels of our other C-Fresh CPG brands. We're optimistic that we can get there with delicious high-quality ingredients, product and packaging innovation, improved marketing and sales support, and expansion into organic and regional flavors.","I do want to take a moment to highlight a positive result in the division. We've made significant gains in our fresh soup business, which continues to grow at high single-digits, driven by both private label and branded soup. We recently introduced a new Garden Fresh Gourmet soup, which has been well received by customers and initial velocity is encouraging.","We're also testing Souplicity, a new artisanal cold-pressed soup. We continue to expect to grow the Garden Fresh Gourmet business profitably, but it will take longer than we originally planned. Overall, we've learned several important lessons from these two packaged fresh acquisitions and we're applying them going forward.","First, establishing a leadership team with diverse skills and experience early on is critical. Our new team combines the talents and capabilities of Campbell and Bolthouse leaders. They're actively integrating C-Fresh into Campbell and taking advantage of our full suite of resources. We're now blending the best of small while also benefiting from the best of big.","Second, fresh food is more perishable and, therefore, more fragile. At Campbell, we're obsessed with safety and quality. We put safety above all else because if we don't, nothing else matters. Meeting Campbell's quality standards in C-Fresh required significant investment and the right resources.","Third, there's no roof over the carrot fields. We've experienced everything from severe drought to record rainfall. This business has been much more volatile than expected. We've set up more diversified growing regions, but we have more to do to strengthen our agricultural operations.","Fourth, the fresh supply chain presents an opportunity for productivity improvement and optimization. We believe we can and will drive margin improvement in these businesses over time.","Finally, we have both the ability and the desire to build strong brands and drive growth in response to increasing consumer demand for fresh foods.","To recap, we're facing some challenges in C-Fresh beyond what we originally realized. Our new leadership team is making progress in addressing them. To be clear, we remain committed to the packaged fresh category and to M&A in the fresh space as we build this growth platform.","Now let's turn to Global Biscuits and Snacks. As a reminder, this division includes our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's, and Kelsen businesses. The organic sales decline in the division was mainly a result of the performance of Kelsen and our decision to forego some less-profitable business for the large U.S. customer. Additionally, the depreciation of the Chinese RMB negatively impacted our sales in China.","Stepping back and looking at the underlying trends in Kelsen, China, we feel good about our execution during the important Chinese New Year period. As we've discussed previously, we've been working to expand our distribution capabilities in China, and we've been adding new sub-distributors to extend our reach.","Our sell-in for Chinese New Year went according to plan and promotion displays were consistently strong across all store formats. We're still awaiting consumer takeaway.","Turning to the U.S., Pepperidge Farm delivered modest sales growth behind the continued strong performance of Goldfish crackers as well as cookies, especially the Milano brand. Goldfish growth benefited from channel gains, leveraging multiple pack sizes and innovative new products. Goldfish made with organic wheat is also attracting new millennial families to the brand.","However, our fresh bakery sales declined as a result of intensified competitive activity, especially in the sandwich bread category. As a reminder, we're cycling double-digit operating earnings growth this quarter, and we expect a strong back half as this division delivers both sales and margin growth.","Looking ahead, we're focused on driving continued growth in Goldfish and increasing innovation in cookies, especially the upcoming launch of our new farmhouse line in April. These cookies leverage Pepperidge Farm's baking heritage and deliver against our Real Food Philosophy with great taste and simple ingredients. We'll also continue to build the national rollout of Tim Tam biscuits in the U.S. following its recent launch in January.","Rounding out the portfolio is our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. I'm encouraged by the sales gains in soup and simple meals. However, this was offset by the lackluster performance of V8 shelf-stable beverages. I continue to be pleased with the Americas gross margin expansion, driven by the performance of our supply chain team. Once again, the division delivered strong operating earnings growth of plus 8%.","Our U.S. soup business grew in the quarter. I'm especially pleased with our ready-to-serve brands. Sales increased double-digits in ready-to-serve. Chunky continued to lead the way behind our improved execution and strong integrated marketing that fully leveraged our NFL sponsorship.","We're also delighted with the launch of our new Well Yes! clean label soup, which hit shelves in December. Retailer acceptance has been exceptional, with ACV already around 75% and most customers taking all nine varieties.","We activated our marketing plans in January and the initial consumer response has been positive. It's early days, but we feel good about our overall execution and how we got out of the starting blocks with this brand.","Sales declines in our broth business were as a result of increased competitive activity, mainly from private label offerings. As discussed last quarter, we had strong holiday merchandising plans for our broth business, and we were pleased with the execution of that program.","However, we did not achieve the consumer takeaway that we expected as a result of an extremely competitive holiday period. In the short term, we will be sharpening our promotional activity and marketing message to drive improved performance in the back half of the year while we continue to develop longer-term plans to improve our competitiveness and differentiation in this important category.","Looking ahead on U.S. soup, we have robust marketing plans in the third quarter and we continue to expect to deliver modest growth in soup this fiscal year.","The shelf-stable beverage category remained sluggish and our portfolio continues to be challenged. As I previously stated, V8 will not grow this year. Let me reframe the conversation to provide a little more context.","In the quarter, consumption grew in two-thirds of our business: V8 100% Vegetable Juice, Veggie Blends and our V8 + ENERGY franchise. All of them are on trend and leverage our heritage in vegetable nutrition. Importantly, we continue to see improved consumption trends in V8 100% Vegetable Juice, following our increased marketing support.","The remaining one-third of the portfolio consisting of V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash is declining, partly due to category-wide consumer concerns about sugar. Despite the overall sales declines, the business continues to focus on productivity initiatives, which are contributing to the overall gross margin expansion in the division. Big picture, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division continues to be on track to deliver modest sales growth and margin expansion.","In closing, I want to stress again that I am not satisfied with our overall sales results this quarter. I own it, and we have plans in place to improve our performance in the second half, deliver our cost savings, invest back in our business, and deliver our full-year guidance.","It's really important to keep sight of the long-term progress we've made in transforming this company in a difficult operating environment: our continued gross margin expansion, how we strengthened our core business while expanding into faster-growing spaces, the investments we're making in real food as a result of our purpose, how we've diversified our portfolio with innovation and acquisitions, and a leaner more agile and more cost-effective company we've become as a result of our successful cost-savings initiative, I look forward to seeing many of you next week at CAGNY where we will focus on Campbell's long-term strategic growth platforms.","Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter. We are disappointed with our sales performance. Declines in C-Fresh and V8 were the primary drivers. On the positive side, we grew U.S. soup sales and Pepperidge Farm snacks had a strong quarter.","Sales results were below our expectations, primarily due to C-Fresh, as the recovery on beverages and carrots is taking longer than previously anticipated, with the additional impact of heavy rains in the quarter, which had a 40 basis point negative impact on adjusted gross margin. Sales and earnings in Garden Fresh Gourmet also declined. And as Denise mentioned, we recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $0.58 per share in our GAAP results related to our Campbell Fresh segment.","Despite the negative impact from C-Fresh, I'm pleased with our overall adjusted gross margin performance, which was up 70 basis points.","We're increasing our cost-savings estimate for 2017 to $85 million, which will put us at our targeted $300 million by the end of fiscal 2017, a year earlier than anticipated. Based on the overall success of the program and the identification of additional savings opportunities, we are increasing our cost-savings target to $450 million by the end of fiscal 2020.","While adjusted EPS increased to $0.91 in the quarter, we recognize that the increase is due to a decline in our adjusted tax rate. We're also wrapping a very strong second quarter last year, in which adjusted EPS increased 23%.","Lastly, with the increased cost savings and lower cost inflation offsetting incremental marketing investment and lower earnings in C-Fresh, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance.","Now I'll review our results in more detail. For the second quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined by 1% to $2.171 billion. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, organic net sales declined 2%, driven by lower volume and higher promotional spending. And as I said earlier, the majority of this decline is driven by lower volumes in Campbell Fresh and our V8 juice business.","Adjusted EBIT declined 1% to $417 million, reflecting the impact of lower sales and higher marketing and selling expenses, partly offset by a higher adjusted gross margin percentage. Benefiting from a lower tax rate, adjusted EPS increased 5% or $0.04 to $0.91 per share.","For the first half, as-reported and organic net sales both declined by 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was comparable to prior year and adjusted EPS of $1.92 was up 5%.","Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, organic sales declined 2%, driven by a 1 point decline from volume and mix, driven primarily by Campbell Fresh and a 1 point decline from higher promotional spending.","In Americas Simple Meals and beverages, promotional spending rates were up on Swanson broth, V8 and in Canada to hold promoter prices following our list price increase. Promotional spending is also up in our Arnott's business in the Asia-Pacific region. Although it rounds to zero on the chart, we did have a slightly positive impact from currency translation, principally the Australian dollar, bringing the change in our as-reported sales to minus 1%.","Our adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 80 basis points. On a rate basis, cost inflation was about 1%, and in Campbell Fresh, increased costs reflect the impact of heavy rains on carrot yields, lower beverage operating efficiencies, and the overall impact of lower volumes. These negative drivers were partly offset by the benefits from our cost-savings initiatives.","Increased promotional spending had a negative impact of 60 basis points, reflecting the drivers I previously discussed. List price increases had a slightly positive impact of 10 basis points, driven primarily by list price actions taken by our retail business in Canada. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 20 basis points, reflecting the sales decline in our lower margin C-Fresh segment.","Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our cost-savings program, contributed 180 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. All in, our gross margin percentage increased 70 basis points to 38%.","Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 5% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses as we reinvest in our brands. The increase in advertising was primarily driven by our investment to support the launch of Well Yes! soups and higher levels of support on V8 juices and Prego pasta sauce.","Adjusted administrative expenses declined 3%, reflecting lower incentive compensation compared to the year-ago quarter, partly offset by higher benefit-related costs and investments in long-term innovations.","For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.04 from $0.87 in the prior-year quarter to $0.91 per share in the current quarter. On a currency neutral basis, decreases in adjusted EBIT had a $0.02 impact on EPS.","Share repurchases lowered our share count, adding a penny benefit. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter decreased by 3.8 points to 27.8%, contributing $0.05 to EPS growth. We benefited from a favorable timing impact related to the impairment charge. This will reverse in the second half and bring us to our forecasted full-year adjusted tax rate, which remains at approximately 32%.","Interest was comparable to the prior year as the impact of higher rate was offset by a lower debt level. Currency translation also had no impact on EPS, completing the bridge to $0.91 per share.","Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales fell 1% to $1.231 billion, as declines in V8 beverages were mostly offset by gains in soup, Prego pasta sauces, and Plum products. Sales of U.S. soups increased 1%, reflecting double-digit gains in ready-to-serve soups, driven by growth in Chunky and the launch of Well Yes!, mostly offset by declines in broth and condensed soups. The strong performance in Chunky reflects our improved execution, including better advertising and successful new items. The launch of Well Yes! is progressing well with strong customer acceptance and supported with a robust marketing plan.","Operating earnings increased 8%, driven by a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from supply chain productivity improvements, partly offset by increased advertising and consumer promotion expenses.","Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending January 29, 2017, the category as a whole declined 1.2%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1%. Campbell had a 58.8% market share for the 52-week period with a share gain of 10 basis points. Private label grew share by 70 basis points, finishing at 13.5%. All other branded players collectively had a share of about 28%, declining 80 basis points.","In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales decreased 1%, driven by declines in Kelsen in the U.S. and Arnott's biscuits, partly offset by gains in Pepperidge Farm. Pepperidge Farm sales increased as growth in crackers, primarily Goldfish, and cookies was partly offset by declines in fresh bakery and frozen products. Operating earnings declined 4% to $135 million, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage as higher promotional spending and supply chain costs were partly offset by productivity improvements.","In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales declined 8%, driven by lower sales of carrots, Bolthouse Farms beverages, and Garden Fresh Gourmet, partly offset by gains in refrigerated soups. Operating earnings declined by $24 million to a loss of $3 million, reflecting higher carrot and beverage production costs as well as from lower sales volumes.","As Denise mentioned, the recovery from both the market share losses on carrots and the beverage capacity constraints will take longer than originally anticipated. The performance of Garden Fresh Gourmet is also short of expectations. We now expect that for the full year, segment sales and earnings will decline in 2017.","The performance of Campbell Fresh is below our previous expectations. We have a new management team in place and they undertook a strategic review, which informed our future plans and expectations for growth.","Based on current performance and lower forecasted sales and earnings growth, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $0.45 per share on the carrots and ingredients business and $0.13 per share on Garden Fresh Gourmet. The other two reporting units in this segment: Bolthouse Farms CPG, which includes beverages and salad dressings, and the fresh soup units, were not affected.","Cash flow from operations was $667 million compared to $754 million generated in the first half of last year. The lower level of cash flow generated reflects higher working capital requirements, primarily driven by changes in accrued liabilities related to taxes and incentive compensation.","Capital expenditures declined $34 million to $119 million. We have lowered our CapEx forecast by $25 million to approximately $325 million for fiscal 2017. The reduction is primarily related to the timing on project in Global Biscuits and Snacks.","We paid dividends totaling $207 million, reflecting our increased quarterly dividend rate of $0.35 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $234 million of shares, $200 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program, as we've increased our level of share repurchases. The balance was made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation.","Net debt declined by $357 million compared to year-ago levels as cash from operations over the last four quarters was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividends, and share repurchases.","We are very pleased with the progress made on our cost-savings program. With our new forecast for incremental savings of $85 million in 2017, we now expect to reach our $300 million target by the end of this fiscal year.","We have generated savings by reducing layers of management and increasing spends of control. We have changed our operating model by creating an integrated global services organization and we're implementing a comprehensive zero-based budgeting process, which is delivering savings across many simple and more complex cost categories.","While our current initiatives would generate in excess of $300 million in savings, we believe there are additional areas of opportunity, which in aggregate will get us to our new target of $450 million.","First, we will look for opportunities to further optimize our supply chain network, primarily in North America. Second, we will continue to evolve our operating model to drive efficiencies and focus resources on our most significant growth opportunities. And, lastly, we will more fully integrate our recent acquisitions to generate cost synergies and improve our effectiveness by leveraging both our enterprise scale and capabilities.","Now, I'll review our 2017 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we first announced last September. We expect sales to grow by zero to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4%, and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5%. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rates, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal.","On our cost-savings program, we now project full-year savings of approximately $85 million compared to our prior forecast of $50 million. Additional cost savings and lower than expected cost inflation about 1.5% compared to the prior forecast of about 2% are offsetting incremental investments in marketing and the softness in Campbell Fresh.","We expect our adjusted gross margin percentage to end the year at about 38%, almost a point better than last year. Our EPS guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, which is unchanged, and the favorable impact of anticipated share repurchases over the course of the year. In terms of timing, we expect the majority of our year-to-go earnings growth to come in the fourth quarter.","That concludes my remarks and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.","Kenneth Gosnell - Campbell Soup Co.","Okay. Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time, out of fairness to the other callers, please ask only one question at a time. Okay, Candice?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, and thanks for the question. One of your competitors in biscuits, obviously, made a fairly major announcement last week. Does that announcement in any way, in terms of distribution, make you rethink your distribution, or is it sort of full steam ahead? Pepperidge has an incredible, obviously, DSD system setup. Just curious if that made you guys go back, rethink things in any way or if it's too early to tell? Any help there would be very appreciated.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. I'll take that one. Thanks, Ken. We're very pleased with the performance of Pepperidge Farm. We've had, particularly in the snacks business, some really good growth. And our distribution system \u2013 DSD distribution system is different, in that it is a network of independent contractors, so that's really how we've assessed it.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. So, is the takeaway then that because it's different and because you're pleased with it, we on the outside should interpret it as it's unlikely to see major changes at any point in the near term?","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. I mean, we're continuing to run our play.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Denise.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I just wanted to ask you in relation to the soup business, the Well Yes! soup product looks to be doing quite well and you had some pipeline fill in the quarter. But did that have an effect on soup sales in the quarter? And if I can ask related to that with the Well Yes! launch, did we see marketing spending go up in relation to that product in the quarter and should we expect that going forward in the second half of the year?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah, a couple of things. So, it's a good question. So the impact of Well Yes! on soup sales in the quarter was about 2 points, so it didn't have a benefit to our net sales number. And as you can imagine, most of that is, obviously, in retail inventory, some did pull through, but not a lot. But as we look at the total inventory on soup, there has been some reduction in other areas. So when you put it all together, changes in retailer inventories in soup did not have an impact on our overall soup sales results in the quarter, but there was some puts and takes in there.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. We're very happy with the introduction of Well Yes! There were great retail support, 75% ACV distribution, displays everywhere, but we won't get a read on the consumer takeaway really until this quarter.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","To your second question, this is going to be supported with a fairly comprehensive and robust marketing program, so you can expect, obviously, an increase in marketing behind this in the third quarter.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","Hey, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, just a question about the prospective cost-savings going forward and, I guess, as you're thinking about balancing how much reinvestment versus how much you'll use to sort of support earnings growth, not trying to get you to be specific in terms of earnings targets in the out year, but just can you sort of maybe give us some color in terms of how you might be thinking about that balance going forward with this new savings versus maybe the way you approached the $300 million you've achieved so far?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. I think, Bryan, the way to think about it is against the incremental $150 million, probably about half will go back in terms of reinvestment, so we've talked about the support before. We need to increase the support behind some of our key brands. We need to continue to support new product launches like we're doing with Well Yes! and Prego's Farmers' Market and Tim Tam's in the U.S. and Goldfish with the organic wheat. So we need to continue to do that.","We'll continue to invest behind our real food initiatives, removing artificial colors and ingredients, removing BPA for our can liners. We'll also continue to invest in longer-term innovation, things like Habit and the Acre Venture Fund and we'll look to make investments to improve our capabilities in areas like digital and eCommerce. So we have a fairly well-balanced plan in terms of what to do with those cost savings.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Quick question on C-Fresh. As your commentary was that it seems you're going to be sort of further integrating that division to take advantage, I guess, of the broader scale and scope and capabilities of the larger Campbell organization. And, I guess, my question is, we've all seen I think a lot of examples over time, whether it be the Kashis of the world where the larger company sort of brings the smaller, more entrepreneurial growthier entity sort of in a bigger way into the sort of the more of the mainstream organization. And, I guess, we've seen a number of examples where that's led maybe those more entrepreneurial businesses to maybe lose some of that sort of progressive nutrition swagger or some of what made them special and growthier in the first place.","So, I mean, I was just trying to get a sense, it's a little broad but, I guess, how do you guard against taking advantage of what the organization can bring to that and not lose what it is that you bought in those businesses to begin with.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Andrew, it is a key question. And when I talk about getting the best of small and the best of big, I'm really serious about what we have done is really delineated those parts of the business that really need to be separate and differentiated for the consumer and the customer, and that's all of the marketing and the R&D and insights. And we have this model that we've used very successfully with our Plum organic baby food business by keeping those parts of the business separate that maintains that entrepreneurial culture.","However, being able to leverage the scale of Campbell's, particularly in areas of the supply chain and in operations where we have resources that can be used to make them much more effective and efficient and even more important achieve scale, because these are typically smaller companies that need the chassis to increase scale in the marketplace.","So we've done this very successfully with Plum and Kelsen. We have not done it with the Campbell Fresh business. And so, the situation that we found ourselves in in the last year, we've been able to insert Campbell executives on the leadership team working in conjunction with Bolthouse Farms executives to maintain that best of small and best of big. So we're really optimistic and we're finding some really great opportunities to put a stronger foundation under the business.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Okay. Thanks for that. And look forward to seeing you next week.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. See you next week.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. I noticed on the opening remarks that you mentioned competitive pressure more often than usual, I would think. It was definitely in fresh bakery and in broth. And my view going into this year was that the food companies would cut costs and focus on price realization and try to avoid deep discounting. Do you see any of that kind of price discipline changing around you in your categories, or do you think it's just kind of a pretty typical year in terms of promotional activity?","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. I think the activity definitely varies by category. And what we've seen in the fresh bakery business is competition in the area of sandwich bread and Swirl bread. We've recently reformulated our Swirl bread and we're out there now with a much-improved product. So that was a very specific situation.","In fresh bakery business, our buns and rolls business continues to rock, so we believe we're all over the issue there. And then in broth, it was really more of a proliferation of private label during the holiday and that produced more price competition and we have responded with increased marketing and actual trade spending to hold our own in that category. So those were two very specific things that we faced.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Can I ask a follow-up to Ken Goldman's question actually? I think what he was kind of getting at is have you ever considered a model where you go to direct-to-customer shipments through warehouses rather than DSD, not so much using \u2013 whether you use independent routes. Is that a big savings or is it even possible in Pepperidge Farm?","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. We've been pleased with the DSD system. The independent contractors, what they bring to the business in terms of selling and merchandising and delivery, it's a quality product. It's perishable, so breakage could be an issue. I think when you consider all of it, we're pleased with our DSD system.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. Your line is now open.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Hi, David.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning. This is Cornell Burnette in with a few questions for David. I just wanted to start off here with ready-to-serve soup, and one of your major competitors made the announcement that they would be reducing capacity. Wanted to get your outlook on what that meant for the category kind of over the long term and specifically does that give you an opportunity perhaps to margin up and be maybe less aggressive with promotions and move prices in a higher direction?","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","We're very focused on our soup business. We're particularly pleased with the performance of ready-to-serve soup, whether that be Chunky or the introduction of new Well Yes! I think you need to ask the other guy.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then on the C-Fresh business, just I know you gave a number of puts and takes of kind of what's going on there this year and some of the things that you're trying to do to get the business back on track. Will some of these headwinds, especially in carrots and issues surrounding the harvest, kind of linger into perhaps F2018 as well?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. So, we've talked about the issues facing us in F2017 and the expectations that the business will decline. We do expect it to turn a bit in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to F2018, we expect to return to growth on this business both top and bottom line.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Hi Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi there.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","Hi Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I guess, a quick question on the commodity cost outlook here is, obviously, you have slightly different mix of input costs, how are things looking? And if the commodity cost environment is getting a little tougher, do you think you'll be able to pass that on in pricing?","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. So I can comment on the commodity cost environment. So, as we look at the full year, we originally thought cost inflation would be around 2% and now we're thinking it closer to 1.5%. So we've seen some favorability relative to our expectations in a couple of areas that are causing that. One is wheat, dairy, resins related to plastic packaging as well as poultry. So, overall, we see a bit of a benefit versus our original expectations.","But we are seeing a swing, first half to back half. It was fairly benign when you look at the core ingredients, packaging and energy, and that's starting to tick up in the second half, and there's a couple of areas in particular that we're seeing. One is dairy. The first half of the year we were wrapping avian flu thing, so that's going to go back more toward normal situation. Vegetable oil is kicking up in the second half and we're beginning to see increases in steel cans as well. I don't know if you follow the steel market, but prices are up fairly significantly on steel. So we've got an overall year, which is going to be okay, but we're seeing an increasing headwind in the back half.","In terms of pricing, I would say we're not ready to talk about any specific pricing actions, but we're right in the midst of starting to formulate our plans for next year, and I'm sure we'll take this into account.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Hi Michael.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro - Campbell Soup Co.","Good morning.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Just back on C-Fresh, you said you had a strategic review and, obviously, that had some changes in your outlook and everything else. Did that also include a review of just your interest in that business long term? Are you evaluating potential alternatives in terms of whether you might even still be interested in having an agriculture business or is that a given? And then just on the branding, you said you would want to step up those efforts. Could you give a little better color on what that might be?","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Sure. The strategic review that the new team undertook looked at, once again, the potential for this business, and we verified the consumer trends toward fresh and health and well-being, the fact that these categories are still growing significantly faster than center-store categories, particularly in the categories that we compete in. So we feel really good about this space strategically.","We've had some execution issues this year and some weather issues in the agricultural part. That's been unfortunate, but that does not sway us from our long-term strategic vision to really build a fresh food platform for Campbell's. And I think the role of the carrots in the business is the authenticity. It's on trend with consumers' desire for fresh produce. Carrots have had a tough go with drought and with heavy rains and some execution issues in the last year, but I do think that that's an important part. It's also the distribution system and scale in produce for us that makes us more important to the retailer. So I know I'm very committed to the business and we expect big things from it going forward.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just any thoughts on the branding? You said you wanted to step that up. I know you talked about some of the packaging changes. Garden Fresh, for example, I think it may be the new packaging you're showing. Is that some of what you're anticipating or is it beyond some of the packaging changes? What's some of the initiatives there?","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. I think, over time, we have an opportunity to build two very strong brands here with Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet. We're continuing to invest in digital marketing, as you point out, some new packaging and definitely new product innovation. So we will continue to support these businesses in the marketplace.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Dickerson of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Hi, Rob.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hello. Yeah, just a question around increased brand building potentially over the next, I call it, three to 12 months and in light of, let's say, a competitor who is stepping away from DSD, which could cause some transitional pressure there for them that they've acknowledged upfront. And then also another competitor who seems to be stepping off a bit promotional activity in the soup category and you're showing some near-term gains there.","So, I'm just curious, do you \u2013 you're, obviously, aware of what's happening in each of your core categories and you're aware of what your competitors are doing. Could you foresee the next 12 months potentially being a period of time in which you might have opportunities to actually increase your investment to try to capture share in kind of a period of instability, so to speak, which I think you actually did fairly well with at one point in time in the bread category? Thanks.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Yeah. Well, as you can see from the quarter, we're continuing to invest in marketing and brand building. And Anthony pointed out that as we navigate through our cost-savings initiative, which we just increased, we will be spending back on our businesses to continue to build these brands. We still need to drive sustainable profitable sales growth and I fundamentally believe that's going to come from investing in the brands and engaging with the consumer. So we will continue on that track.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. I'll see you next week.","Denise M. Morrison - Campbell Soup Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

At this time, all participants' lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Ken Gosnell, Vice President, Finance Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Ken Gosnell","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Campbell's first quarter 2020 earnings call. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find these slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who will participate in a listen-only mode.","Turning to Slide 3; today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in the appendix of this presentation.","On Slide 4, you can see what we plan to cover today. With us on the call today are Mark Clouse, Campbell's President and CEO, and our new Chief Financial Officer, Mick Beekhuizen. Mark, will share his thoughts on our performance in the quarter and then Mick will walk through the financial details and our updated guidance for fiscal 2020.","With that, let me turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Clouse","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before I get to our performance, I want to acknowledge that Ken has decided to retire from Campbell and this should be his last earnings call as Vice President of Investor Relations. Ken, thank you for your contributions to the Company through the years and we wish you the best in your retirement.","Our results to start the year were largely consistent with our expectations. As we discussed during our fourth quarter call, fiscal 2020 will be a year of stabilization for the Company as we invest in the business, optimize the portfolio, and fully implement our new operating model, including further integrating our snacks division.","We continue to make great progress across these focus areas, building upon the foundation we put in place in fiscal 2019. Looking at our results, organic sales were slightly below year ago, just under 1%. Performance reflected continued strength in the snacks segment where sales increased 2% with contributions across the business. This was more than offset by a 3% sales decline in Meals & Beverage, in large part due to the timing of US Soup shipments related to the Thanksgiving holiday. Although this timing shift resulted in a headwind in Q1, I fully expect that to balance in Q2. What I'm most encouraged by is our end market performance where we are building momentum across both divisions.","In fact, in measured channels, our total company end market consumption grew more than 1%. Our brands grew or held share in categories representing more than 80% of our total business and finally in 10 of our stated 13 priority categories. This was led by gains in Soup share for the first time in nearly three years.","We continue to execute upon the other key elements of our strategic plan, including a 30 basis point gross margin expansion, supported by productivity improvements and cost savings. We delivered $45 million in cost savings in the quarter inclusive of our multi-year enterprise program and the synergies from our snacks integration. Adjusted EBIT was better than we expected, although the majority of the upside was timing resulting in double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","Turning to a discussion of our segments on Slide 7, let's start with Meals & Beverages. As a reminder, when we spoke last quarter, I indicated we had a great deal of work to do to stabilize this business and the mixed results in Q1 reflect many of those actions. This includes optimization of our portfolio and increased investments.","For instance A&C is up 2% in the division in Q1 including a 15% increase on our US Soup brands behind earlier in season advertising while overall TDPs in the division were down around 6%. The net of this is improving consumption only down about 1% and share in market, positive. But clearly, we have not yet achieved our overall goal of stabilization. This will take some time but I am happy with the progress.","As previously mentioned, the difference in our net sales and consumption was primarily holiday timing of shipments, which we expect to recover in Q2 and some proactive decisions that we have made to optimize certain lower profit foodservice volume.","Turning specifically to the US Soup; while the impact of timing of Thanksgiving shipments was most pronounced on soup, where our condensed varieties and broths play a sizable role in many holiday recipes, we are making encouraging progress in market on the business. We are injecting much needed investment and continuing to strengthen important retailer relationships while also rationalizing the portfolio.","As we've discussed before, in my view, the first step in this journey is stabilizing share. This quarter marked the first time in ten quarters that Campbell gained overall Soup share. In fact, we grew or maintained share across the condensed, ready to serve, and broth categories. This is one of the early indicators of progress on our three-year journey to revitalize US Soup.","On Slide 9, while soup sales declined 3% in the quarter, consumption only declined about 1%, improved velocities in soup were essentially offset by TDP losses in the quarter. And I'll unpack that more on the next slide. As you can see, the 2 point gap between net sales and consumption is due entirely to the timing of Thanksgiving.","Turning to Slide 10; we are investing more in the category, both on condensed and ready to serve with advertising dollars up. We started our advertising earlier, a month sooner this fiscal year. And while it's early days, the response to our initial investments is encouraging. For example, our new tomato soup advertising went on air September 30th and we saw positive lifts immediately. Through the start of the second quarter we've improved on those lifts, which are now up 7%.","We have also increased our promotional frequency across the portfolio, which is a product of our improving retailer relationships and select high ROI investments. Moving onto TDPs, as we mentioned back in August, we've experienced distribution headwinds due to historic lack of support and some of our own choices to optimize our Soup portfolio.","Approximately 80% of these TDP losses are what I would characterize as non-regrettable, meaning that they were lower velocity SKUs coming from the tail of our condensed and ready to serve segments. However, about 20% are SKUs that should remain and with the support we've added, we have an even higher, stronger velocities. We're pushing hard to get those back. But what is most important right now is to sustain our velocity as we head into the heart of the soup season.","With each month of progress, we are laying the foundation for the sustainment of the category and next year with more innovation, the aim is to ultimately expand the category. In summary, I feel good about the direction in which we are headed on soup; including the improvements we're seeing on Pacific, which we expect to return to top line growth this year.","I'm also encouraged by how the portfolio is responding to the actions we are taking. As I've emphasized from day one, change won't happen overnight. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect that our net sales profile in the US Soup business will continue to improve.","In other parts of the division, I'm pleased with the performance of our Prego brand, which continued its strong momentum and maintained its number one share position in the Italian sauce category. Turning to V8, the shelf-stable juice category remains challenged as we continue to optimize our portfolio, primarily on Splash. We are reshaping the portfolio around the plant-based positioning of V8 red, the V8 Plus energy product which is outperforming the category and our overall single-serve platform. Our new campaign focuses on a master brand story for V8 as the original plant-power drink.","We believe we have the right to own this space and are pleased with early indications of this investment. While the declines on Splash more than offset these improvements, they aligned with our expectations. It's early days in our efforts to stabilize our Meals & Beverages business, but I feel good about our progress thus far and I have confidence in the team to continue to improve our performance.","Let's look at our Snacks segment on Slide 12. This was another very good quarter for the business with organic sales increasing 2%, which includes a nearly 4% in market result, offset by the 1% headwind for partner brands that we discussed last quarter.","We continue to drive strong consumption on our nine power brands, while also making steady progress on our integration plans and value capture targets, both of which give me further confidence in our strategy, our investments and our team. Operating profit was comparable to the prior year as we front-loaded marketing investment in the first quarter. We expect our profit performance to improve as the year unfolds.","Once again, eight of our nine power snack brands grew or held share in the quarter. The Snacks business is maintaining momentum behind our proven growth model, which we are now deploying across the full portfolio. Marketing investments are up significantly across our nine power brands with select trade investments to maintain price gaps. These investments continued to pay off. Total Snacks consumption grew nearly 4% in measured channels while our power brands grew 6%.","We are seeing nearly two times the consumption growth on our power brands versus the rest of the snacks portfolio as we focus the portfolio and invest behind these differentiated brands that are truly driving the business.","The Pepperidge Farm portfolio continued to lead the way with its 20th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. Goldfish continued to perform well with increases on the core business. Our bakery business continued its growth behind buns and rolls, sandwich bread, and swirl.","Marketplace performance was also strong on our salty snacks brands, where we drove double-digit growth on late July, while Cape Cod, Kettle and Snyder's pretzels continued to respond well to our increased marketing investments with both consumption and share growth. As discussed last quarter, the partner brands in our portfolio are performing in line with expectations impacting our Snacks sales by 1%. We expect this headwind throughout fiscal '20.","Let's take a closer look at the progress we're making on our integration and value capture on Slide 14. I remain satisfied with the pace of our progress. In the first quarter, we continued to deliver additional savings across the three key areas; synergies and procurement around packaging, the consolidation of sales headquarters and related operations, and driving operational efficiency in our manufacturing. We expect to continue to deliver savings against these three initiatives in the first half of the year and we're off to a strong start. Looking to the back half, we expect initiatives around manufacturing and logistics to begin to contribute to our overall savings.","In summary, I'm very excited by the progress and potential of our Snacks business. I continue to view it as a unique advantage and differentiated portfolio that is responding well to our investments and the best of both capabilities of the combined businesses.","With that, let me introduce Mick Beekhuizen, who joined Campbell in October after serving as CFO at Chobani for the past three years where he helped to improve the company's capital structure and supported its growth and expansion. He brings significant experience in debt reduction and cash flow generation, both of which are key priorities at Campbell. Mick's diverse experience will be a tremendous asset as we continue to reposition Campbell for sustainable profitable growth.","Now let me turn it over to Mick.","Mick Beekhuizen","Thanks, Mark. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Mark stated, sales were slightly down but were largely in line with our expectations. Within Meals & Beverages, soup shipments were down 3 points of which approximately two-thirds reflects the timing of shipments with the later Thanksgiving holiday. Consumption remains solid and share trends continued to improve.","And Snacks delivered 2% growth, which included a 1 point headwind from partner brands. We are pleased with improving trends in our gross margin, as we benefited primarily from productivity improvements, cost savings, and pricing, partially offset by cost inflation and trade investments. We continue to make strong progress against our cost savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022, delivering $45 million of incremental savings in the first quarter, bringing the program to-date total for continuing operations to $605 million.","Year-over-year, adjusted EBIT increased 6%, slightly better than expected, benefiting from some timing on the cost side. We continue to make progress on our divestiture program with the sale of Kelsen completed in September, the sale of the European Chips business completed in October, and the remaining portion of Campbell International expected to close before the end of our second quarter. Proceeds received to date along with positive cash flow from the business have enabled us to reduce debt levels by approximately $1.5 billion over the past 12 months.","Lastly, we are updating our fiscal 2020 sales guidance to reflect the sale of the European Chips business, which was not included in our guidance previously provided in August. Our underlying outlook for organic sales as well as adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS remains unchanged.","Overall, we had a solid quarter and we are currently on track to achieve our fiscal year goals. Given the seasonality of our business combined with increased marketing support in the second quarter, we expect to see our performance through the first half to be more in line with our full year guidance, excluding the impact of the 53rd week, which obviously falls in the second half of the year.","I'll now review our results in more detail. For the first quarter, reported and organic sales decreased 1% to approximately $2.2 billion as gains in Snacks were more than offset by declines in Meals & Beverages. Adjusted EBIT increased 6% to $392 million as sales declines were more than offset by lower adjusted administrative expenses, higher adjusted other income and improved gross margin performance. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased by 10% or $0.07 to $0.78 per share due to our adjusted EBIT performance and lower interest expense.","Breaking down our net sales performance for the quarter, organic net sales were down 1%. Overall volumes were stable as declines in Meals & Beverages were offset by increases in Snacks with gains across much of the portfolio. Sales benefited by slightly less than 1 points from pricing actions primarily within Meals & Beverages taken in fiscal 2019.","Promotional spending investments within both Snacks and Meals & Beverages negatively impacted net sales by a little over a point. The impact from currency translation in the quarter was neutral, as we refocus our portfolio on North America. We would continue to expect currency translation impacts to be minimal. All in, our reported and organic net sales were down just under 1%.","Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 30 basis points in the quarter to 33.8%. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 170 basis points. On a rate basis, overall input prices increased by approximately 3% reflecting higher prices on steel cans as well as areas such as vegetables and flower.","Net pricing led to a 30 basis point decline in adjusted gross margin as the benefits from list pricing actions were more than offset by increased promotional spending. Going the other way, our ongoing supply chain productivity program contributed a 130 basis points and our cost savings program also added 90 basis points to gross margin expansion. Mix was favorable by 10 basis points, bringing the gross margin percentage to 33.8%. We are pleased with these gross margin results as we continued to achieve improvement in performance.","Moving on to other operating items, adjusted marketing and selling expenses decreased 1% in the quarter to $206 million as increased investments in advertising and consumer promotion were more than offset by the benefits of cost saving initiatives. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 7% to $126 million, primarily reflecting the benefits of cost savings initiatives. And while not shown on the chart, adjusted other income was $8 million compared to zero in the prior year period. The year-over-year impact of $8 million contributing to our EBIT performance in the quarter reflects lower losses on investments and higher pension and post-retirement benefit income.","Going to the next slide, we have continued to successfully deliver against our multi-year enterprise cost savings program. This quarter, we achieved $45 million in savings, inclusive of Snyder's-Lance synergies. To-date, that brings our savings for the overall program to $605 million. We expect incremental cost savings in the range of $140 million to $150 million for the full year and continue to track to our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022.","For additional perspective on our performance, the next chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.07 from $0.71 in the prior year quarter to $0.78 per share. Adjusted EBIT had a positive $0.05 impact on EPS. Net interest expense declined year-over-year by $10 million, delivering a $0.03 positive impact to EPS, as we have used proceeds from completed divestitures and our strong cash flow to reduce debt. Lastly, our adjusted effective tax rate of 24%, while slightly higher than prior year, rounds to no impact, completing the bridge to $0.78 per share.","Now turning to our segment's results; in Meals & Beverages, sales decreased 3% to $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting declines in US Soup as well as Foodservice, which were partially offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces. Sales of US Soup decreased 3% with shipments lagging in-market consumption by 2 points, which were negatively impacted by movements in retailer inventory levels in both broth and condensed soups related to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday.","Sales of ready-to-serve soups were comparable to the prior year. As mentioned, our Soup share trends continued to improve, gaining 50 basis points of share in the quarter. Segment operating earnings declined 3% to $282 million. The decline was driven primarily by cost inflation and sales declines, offset partially by the benefits of cost savings initiatives and supply chain productivity programs.","In Snacks, sales in the quarter increased 2% to approximately $1 billion. This performance was driven by gains in Goldfish crackers as well as gains in fresh bakery products, Pepperidge Farm cookies and Cape Cod and Kettle Brand potato chips, offset partially by declines in the partner brands.","As we discussed with you last quarter, we are continuing our planned prioritization of select partners to reduce complexity and improve execution. And as Mark mentioned, eight of our nine snack power brands grew or held market share in the quarter. Segment operating earnings of $125 million were comparable to the prior year, as the benefits of cost savings initiatives and supply chain productivity programs were offset by cost inflation and increased marketing support.","Cash from operations for Q1 fiscal 2020 decreased year-over-year by $49 million to $182 million primarily related to the year-over-year increased payout of incentive compensation. We continued to make progress regarding our working capital management efforts. And while cash flow for the year will benefit from these efforts, we expect the impact to be at a lower level of improvement than what we achieved in fiscal 2019.","Cash from investing activities increased by $369 million to $269 million primarily related to the net proceeds from the sale of Kelsen and the European Chips business. The cash outflow for capital expenditures was $98 million; $13 million lower than the prior year. We continue to forecast capex of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2020. Cash outflows for financing activities were $453 million compared to $148 million a year ago. The year-over-year incremental cash flow reflect the use of divestiture proceeds to pay down debt levels. Dividends paid in the amount of $107 million were comparable to the prior year, reflecting our current quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share.","Overall, we continue to make progress to delever our balance sheet. Net debt of $8.2 billion declined by approximately $1.5 billion compared to the prior year as proceeds from the completed divestitures along with positive cash flow generated by the business were used to reduce debt. We expect to complete the remaining divestiture of Arnott's and certain other International businesses in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and we will use the net proceeds to further reduce our debt level. With our current outlook, we expect our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to be well below 4 times by the end of fiscal 2020.","Now, I'll review our updated guidance for continuing operations for 2020. The only thing that has changed is that we are updating our guidance for the sale of the European Chips business which we completed in October. The impact from this divestiture was not included in the guidance previously provided on August 30th. Unlike other recent divestitures, primarily given its size, it is not treated as a discontinued operation and has been, through the date of sale, included as part of continuing operations. This divestiture will have about a negative 2 percentage point impact on sales for the balance of the year and no impact on adjusted EBIT or adjusted EPS. Also, as previously discussed, fiscal 2020 is a 53 week year resulting in an additional week which we believe to have about a 2 percentage point impact across net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. As a result, we expect reported and organic net sales of minus 1% to plus 1%; adjusted EBIT of plus 2% to plus 4%; and adjusted EPS of plus 9% to plus 11% or $2.50 to $2.55 per share.","And for clarity, our outlook for organic sales excludes the negative 2 point impact from the sale of the European Chips business as well as a 2 point contribution from the 53rd week. Overall, I'm excited to be part of the team and pleased with the results of my first quarter with Campbell.","I will now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Clouse","Thanks, Mick. Before taking your questions, I wanted to add a new section to our comments for this quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. As we discussed at our Investor Day, transparency and clear milestones are important to track the progress of our turnaround. You may remember this page from June, which I believe continues to serve as a great scorecard for our progress against the key metrics we outlined.","I feel very good about the underlying progress we have made to start the new fiscal year. While we have more work to do in terms of stabilizing the topline, we are slightly ahead of schedule on margins and EBIT and I'm very pleased with our progress around building a winning team and culture, especially the speed at which we have implemented our new operating model and how we are adding new skills and capabilities while saving cost. On balance, we are doing what we said we would do.","With that, let's take some questions.","Ken Gosnell","Thanks, Mark. We'll be happy to take your questions. Krystal, let's open the lines and take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning everybody. And thanks for all your help over the years, Ken, and welcome to you Mick. Two questions from me. I guess first, Mark, in thinking about Soup at this point. On the one hand, shipments were down this quarter against an easier comp, but on the other, there was the negative impact from a late Thanksgiving that you talked about, some of which should reverse, and also Campbell gained share, obviously, for the first time in 10 quarters, I think you said. So, perhaps you can put these results maybe in broader context with where you are in the overall Soup turnaround plan for starters.","And then second, maybe for Mick, just the cost savings and synergies obviously came in strongly at $45 million in the first quarter, well ahead of, I guess, what would have been implied by your goal of $140 million to $150 million for the full year. So, with such a strong first quarter performance included in the original plans for the year, if not like what drove the upside and maybe how do we think about the cadence of savings and synergies for the remainder of the year? Thank you.","Mark Clouse","Great. Alright, so why don't I hit the soup question first, Mick, and then we'll talk about the phasing of the savings. I think it's -- how I would categorize Soup for the first quarter is essentially very much in line with what we kind of described in the fourth quarter. If we set aside the timing of the Thanksgiving shipments where you had an overall Soup business that was essentially down about 1%, and the balancing act here is, let's start with the things that we're feeling very good about.","And in all honesty, a couple of these areas were better than I expected for where we are in the journey. And I think it starts with share. As we've said all along, really what we want to do as a first step is kind of slow down or stop the share loss that we've been experiencing over the last several years and so have done that in condensed, ready-to-serve, and in broth in the same quarter, I think, was a very important milestone in continuing to move us forward. And if you think about why and how that happened, I think the part that probably has made the most excited is the response that we're seeing in market to the investments we're making.","And if you think about this as a continuum through the year of investing or at least through the first two quarters of investing in different parts of the business, the first investments we made were coming back on air with our chunky advertising, bringing mom back into the picture. I'm sure you've seen that -- seen the ads as well as the advertising that we have on the condensed businesses where we focus on the eating soup, so primarily tomato and chicken noodle.","And in both cases, the response to that has been very, very strong and if you look at the more recent weeks that are going to fall into Q2, you'd see that momentum accelerating even further. In fact our ready-to-serve businesses in the latest four weeks are up about 7% and our condensed eating soups are up almost double digits. And so -- and with both having very strong share performances as well.","And I think a big part of it is we're tackling head on some of the challenges that the business had. So, our condensed ads are focused on driving the quality perception. If you see how the ads are constructed, we're actually embracing the can and really connecting it to the quality of the food inside, whether that's no added preservatives on chicken noodle or whether that's six tomatoes or romancing it in the occasion of grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup which we haven't advertised in a long time.","And I think those are all very, very strong and what we're going to see now in the weeks ahead is condensed on the cooking side and our broth business, which are both areas that really didn't start until Q2. I also feel good about how our price gap management and our differentiation strategies are going as it relates to private label. We've seen a major turnaround in the share relationship on condensed as it relates to private label. And although, I'm still a little weary on the broth side and I'll talk about that in a second, I am happy to see the recovery of share on condensed that we had lost over several years.","And no doubt, underlying that too is this improvement I would say in our retail partnerships, where people are embracing the fact that we're coming back to the table with the vision and a direction. And I think as this continues to build momentum, we could see velocities which were up 4% in Q1. I think we could see those accelerate as we go forward. And as we said, in the next iterations adding innovation seeing the full impact of advertising over time, I would say, on balance, I feel really good about where we are right now.","I think the headwinds, as we talked about in the fourth quarter, is primarily the distribution side. And again if I'm honest here, I think 80% of this is what I would call non-regrettable as I described in my remarks. And about 20% of it I think are things that should be in there. And I think as we continue to build the case on velocity, we're going hard at getting those back in and I think we'll experienced success if we're able to maintain this in-market momentum that we've seen.","I mean the fact of the matter is, we're living a little bit with the history of not having supported the category and the businesses. And a lot of these decisions on the category and the resets were made on a historical set of performance factors that honestly warranted some rationalization. As I said, I think the name of the game right now is keep month-in month-out building our case for the category and showing the demonstrated improvement and the impact of focusing on the right areas.","And then the other two areas that I think are working as headwinds; one is Pacific, but we're seeing steady increase. In fact, if you look at the latest four weeks on Pacific you're actually seeing a decline in market of just over 1% which is a significant improvement from where we've been, and I do expect that to swing into positive territory as the year unfolds. So still a headwind, but I think significantly improved from the double-digit declines we experienced.","And then broth is a little bit of a wildcard. I'm anxious to see these next two weeks, which are the key weeks of Thanksgiving to really see if both the advertising and some of the price gap management we're doing is going to be enough to balance what is an aggressive growth trajectory that private labels had. But I do think with the support and Pacific, which obviously plays an important role on broth for us kind of having support for the first time in a lot of years we're, I would say, cautiously optimistic of how that looks.","So that reality of where we are, if you think about this going forward, I think the drivers are not going to change materially in Q2. Obviously, we're going to get the benefit of the timing, I think more of the underlying variables are going to be roughly the same. But again, I wouldn't be surprised if we continue to build some momentum in a few areas as well. So net-net, I kind of feel like we're right where we wanted to be in Q1 and some green shoots and some areas that we still need to work on.","Andrew Lazar","Great. And then, I think Mick is [indiscernible] in the cost saves cadence.","Mark Clouse","Yes.","Mick Beekhuizen","Yes. So with regard to the cost savings, it's a good question. I spent quite a bit of time on it since joining the company, particularly, obviously the cost saving programs as well as the focus on the synergies with regard to Snyder's-Lance and going -- looking at the first quarter, generated about $45 million of cost savings. We're off to a good start. I feel good about it. I feel good where we are. That being said, it's still early in the year and all that -- kind of looking at the details, I do feel very good about the target of $140 million to $150 million for the full year.","Mark Clouse","Yes. I mean I think the reality Andrew is, is that we are a little bit ahead of where we expected as it relates to EBIT and some of that is the reflection of cost savings coming a little faster. We don't necessarily see them to be incremental on the year, but we're always happy when we can get to savings a little faster. But I would suggest that the upside in Q1 is a little bit of timing that I would expect to smooth out over Q2. And, as we -- as Mick said in his comments, we're kind of expecting to exit the first half pretty much right down the center of the fairway as it relates to where our 52-week guidance sits relative to both kind of top and bottom line. And maybe a little bit of opportunity if we continue to see some of that momentum on Soup and could continue to move forward on savings. But for where we are right now, we see a little bit more of it is as the timing factor.","Andrew Lazar","Great. Thanks so much everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning. Two from me -- hey. First question, you talked about shipments trailing consumption, obviously, thanks to the Thanksgiving shift. Mark, as we think about the first [ph], I guess few weeks so far of the second quarter, have you seen shipments outpace consumption as the shift reverses, so that would be my first question. And then my second one is, on the 20% of distribution reduction that was, I guess regrettable is the word, some of your peers -- some of your customers have talk lately about how retailers are shifting their shelf sets maybe simplifying them to reduce some out of stocks. Are you seeing any impact on that on your business as far as you can tell. I'm just trying to get a sense of how -- where the sort of distribution losses are coming from that you're not necessarily hoping for? Thank you.","Mark Clouse","Yes. No, it's a great question. First on the phasing. So what I would tell you is, let me kind of hit it both on the shipment and the consumption side. So on the shipment side, I would say, we see a fair amount of the first month of the quarter and it's building very strong confidence that this idea of the phasing shifting from Q1 to Q2 will in fact occur. I think on the consumption side, we also continue to be very encouraged by what we're seeing in the latest four week numbers. They're some of the better performance on, like I said, the places that have gotten the majority of the advertising. However, what I will say is the next two weeks of consumption that we don't have will be inclusive of the key weeks of the holiday. So I would tell you in a couple of weeks from now, I'll have a very good feel for how we fared through Thanksgiving, which of course is a pretty quick turn from that one into Christmas and the December holiday period. So we'll have a little bit of foreshadowing there. But like I said, all of the indicators I see right now are, for the most part, either very much in line or in some cases a little bit ahead and more positive than I might have expected at this point.","And then let me talk about the distribution. It's -- I do think that there is a reality of retailers really rationalizing their space and understanding where the value creation is happening in the store. And in some cases that may be reducing assortment to create greater slots for core items that may be turning at much faster pace and I think that we are seeing a little bit of that within the world of Soup. And in our mind that's okay, right. That's where a lot of the non-regrettable rationalization is happening. If you take the last 10 items within our condensed soup business, it's in the third and fourth quartile. As it relates to velocity, those aren't our most efficient SKUs anyway. And so the idea that we get to a little bit more focused and tighter set and especially given some of the early successes we're having on supporting the core, I would say we feel pretty good about that and kind of are managing it and expecting it.","I think the 20%, in some ways, has to do with the fact that I would describe it a little bit as collateral damage as retailers may have kind of cut a bigger piece, given a backward look at the performance of the category and our businesses. And I think, that is a risk that we certainly identified and understood. And I think we'll reverse that. I don't think it's a -- the key that I think people should be focused on is, do we think it's systemic and going to continue.","And the answer is, I do not believe that will happen. I think we're getting to a very good set now where the foundation of the distribution, I need to get that 20% back, which I think we're building some good cases to do it, and then build smart innovation on the top of that, things like our convenience platforms where over time we're going to see a range of options that includes seven ounces, that include our 11 ounce sipping going up, all the way to 12-ounce, which is a little bit more of a meal replacement size. This combination of bringing more relevant formats into the isle, that's what we're making some room for and I think that we're going to have a very strong story going forward. So I think your insight is right. I think we're certainly experiencing it here, but I also feel good that we're turning the tide and even as we're having conversations with customers, we already have agreement in certain areas where we're going to bring stuff back or that the acceptance of our innovation so far has been very, very strong.","Ken Goldman","Thanks so much.","Mark Clouse","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","Good morning, everyone. Couple of quick ones from me. First, I'm not sure that -- I don't know if I missed it or not, but did you give an outlook for capital spending for the year?","Mick Beekhuizen","Yes, we did. $350 million, it hasn't changed. It's basically in line with what we previously provided.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then second, there's been a lot of discussion about shipments versus consumption in Soup. So I guess just for the full year, should we expect that your shipments would be in line with consumption or is there anything that would cause the two not to sort of converge for the full year?","Mark Clouse","No, I think you should expect over the course of the year for them to be pretty close. It's always a little -- there's always a little bit of choppiness as you think about timing. So you know, what is you look forward, really think about where the key holidays hit. We'll have Easter here ahead of us in the quarters ahead. But I think the full year should be pretty close where consumption and shipments should be aligned. We see no reason to expect a material step down in further inventory levels and -- or any other cause or factor that would change it beyond what we're going to experience a little bit from quarter-to-quarter.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then, just last one, you made some comments -- commentary about expecting that debt-to-EBITDA would be meaningfully below 4 times by year-end. And so I guess maybe Mark if you could just -- philosophically, if you're getting at that point where there is some flexibility with free cash flow. Just how you think about capital allocation, share repurchases, raising dividends, investing back in the business. Just how we may think about -- just how you're thinking about that if you're starting to sit on a pile of money.","Mark Clouse","Yes. So as we sit here today, the capital priorities would be consistent with what we previously communicated, where essentially it's about supporting the growth of the business, reducing our debt and paying our dividends, right. That's kind of been the framework of what we've been living into. I do think and I don't think this day is necessarily today, and for the most part, probably won't be within this year. But as we get ourselves back closer to that 3 times level, I do think we're open to that conversation. Of course, we'll continue to maintain kind of that those top two of -- or top three of investing in growth, of course managing that debt level down and paying our dividend. But then at that point. I think it's right to have the conversation on would we look at other tuck-in M&A that might fill in some holes within our portfolio or be valued combinations with some of the businesses we have today.","I would not expect us to be heading into transformational and bigger M&A. I just don't think that's where we are right now in the journey. But I could imagine that as we get into a reasonable debt level that we might look at some smaller contributions as well as of course always, although not approved today, I think there is always room for conversation around share repurchasing or increasing dividend, depending on the circumstances and kind of how we view the outlook going forward. So I think that conversation happens kind of as we're exiting this year into next year.","Bryan Spillane","Excellent, thank you very much.","Mark Clouse","Okay. Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC. Your line is open.","Nik Modi","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mark, maybe you can just -- hey good morning. Maybe you can just provide some consumer diagnostics. I mean clearly the category or at least Campbell Soup business has been improving. Can you help us kind of understand what's going on at the consumer level. Are you bringing lapsed consumers back? Are these new consumers? Are you just share-shifting? Any context around that would be helpful.","Mark Clouse","Yes. So I think there's a couple of dynamics that are happening at the consumer level. I think -- I'll put it in the kind of three buckets. The biggest bucket I do see us influencing is lapsed users, which is our primary initial objective and this is -- we know that the primary barrier to that is the perception of the product and so as we have gone aggressively after quality and kind of context, right. When you think about the wholesomeness of tomato soup and grilled cheese, which I think all of us here are a little bit, I guess, pleasantly surprised at how well consumers have responded to that message as well as the understanding that giving people a bit more permission with our chicken noodle soup with no added preservatives is making a big differences targeting right there. In fact, we've seen slight ticks up in penetration, which is something that I don't know that we can determine when the last time we saw that occur. So that -- I think that's one area.","Two, I think the other thing that is really helping us at the consumer level is this idea of new consumers entering into cooking. So a lot of discussion around millennials over the years and the reality is that as Millennials age, we are finding them participating more and more in in-home preparation, we call it quick scratch cooking, which is essentially assembling several components to make a meal and of course our broth business, both Swanson and Pacific as well as our condensed cooking soups like cream of mushroom and cream of chicken are very, very easy, convenient, and again, as we reinforce the message of more fresh cream, no added preservatives for that millennial audience we're beginning to find a role within their lifestyle and that relevance is really important for us as you imagine our ability to turn the category over time.","And then I think the third area that we're although early days that I continue to be very encouraged by is the performance of our sipping soups which allows us to kind of move into a more snacking occasions and we're doing that with the Well Yes! platform right now. But as the year unfolds, we'll be rolling out the bone broth, which is a big protein nutritional play, which we know is very relevant along with some continued expansion of different flavors. All three of those dynamics and that's why this is not a simple turnaround and it takes some time, all three of those areas are places where we're influencing consumers positively. And the good news in all of it is, as we think about those actions that we're taking, they also help us differentiate within the category and that differentiation is why I'm happy to see the share improvement because, again, I think our opportunity to improve is a little bit of a heavier lift to really get the category fully moving. But if we can at least ensure that we're winning the fight within the category and growing share and all the actions I just described are helping us do that, that's what we're kind of looking for.","Does that help, Nick?","Nik Modi","Yes, very helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English","Good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. Very much appreciate it. Ken, we'll miss working with you and good luck on the next chapter and Mick welcome on board, looking forward to getting -- to know you more.","Mick Beekhuizen","Yes.","Jason English","A couple of quick questions. First, sort of housekeeping, I think you mentioned a couple of times EBIT is already ahead of schedule because of some timing impact and I noticed in the press release you referenced some things like gains on open commodity contracts and some pension income. Can you quantify what sort of tailwinds are -- were -- and when you expect them to online to reverse the other way?","Mick Beekhuizen","Sure. Yes, let me take that Mark and you can add in the back-end but just -- if I look at kind of I tend to look at probably a little bit more across the P&L and if we then look at kind of Q1 EBIT and break down the different components, that's probably the easiest way to look at it, you see that basically there was a slight topline decline, which was then basically offset by some gross margin improvements. Then within sales and marketing, we had savings from our selling expenses slightly more than offset our increased marketing investments. And then if you look at the admin expenses, those were primarily driven by savings from the restructuring of our operating model. And then finally, within, particularly other income, there were some one-time items that I described more in detail, as you know, in my prepared remarks.","Mark Clouse","Yes. So, I think part of it Jason is the one-time items are just going to give a little bit of a bump into Q1 that was contemplated in the year, but certainly shows Q1 up a little bit. That obviously we expected. I do think some of the underlying improvement on the cost side is what we were pleasantly surprised with a little bit earlier, both on the operating model within this admin costs and SG&A side as well as a little bit of some of the cost savings that sit within the selling and marketing number. One of the numbers that's really important to think about is, our marketing and selling was down about 4%, but that was driven primarily by about a 9% decline on the selling, which had to do with a little bit of what we've done through the reorganization. Our marketing was up about 4%, but even more importantly within that our A&C was up 12% in the quarter and Snacks was up 23%, Meals & Beverage was up 2%, but Soup was up 15%.","So, I think what happened was, we got a little bit better inflow of those savings in Q1. I would expect that most of that should smooth out in Q2. It's not like we pulled fourth quarter savings into Q1. I think it was more kind of months of timing that it was full year. So as I said, I think if I'm looking at the first half, I'm kind of expecting the first half total to look very consistent with what our full year outlook or guidance is.","Jason English","That's helpful, thank you. And I think you partially answered my second question, which was the margin profile of Snacks. Given the over delivery on savings, it was surprising for me to see margins sequentially go lower into this and even from a year-on-year they look softer than what we would have expected. The 23% jump on marketing in Snacks, how much of -- can you quantify the drag on margins, just so we can get a slightly cleaner read on sort of what's happening with the underlying margin profile for that business.","Mark Clouse","Sure. Yes, happy to do that. Yes, I think if you look at kind of the building blocks as you went through it. Our cost savings and our productivity that was in there was about the same amount as the investment and that's why you're seeing a relatively flat bottom line and the way to think about the year on Snacks, this might help give you perspective is, if you remember, we kind of started this investment model on Snacks in Q3. And so if you imagine that the synergies being relatively stable across the four quarters, your first couple of quarters are going to have material steps up in the marketing and advertising as well some investment in trade that we're still working on to get those price points right primarily on the Snyder's-Lance businesses.","As you go through the year, the incrementality of what we're spending from a marketing standpoint will drop and more of those cost savings will come through. So I think as you look at subsequent quarters, I would expect the margin to improve in each quarter. And by the time you get to the end of the year, I think it's probably going to be much closer to what you might have modeled for the year with all of the puts and takes we've given you.","Jason English","Helpful stuff. Thanks a lot guys. I'll pass it on.","Mark Clouse","Okay, yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Growe","Hi, and welcome, Mick. And Ken, we wish you all the best. Just to follow on to your answer there and I think Mark you mostly answered it to Jason's question, but obviously some of those timing differential has a negative effect on the second quarter. At the same time, you have shipments that hopefully will benefit the second quarter. So just trying to get my head around, you provide any color around Q2 EPS, just given all the moving pieces in that quarter?","Mark Clouse","Yes, you know Chris, I always try to avoid giving direct quarterly guidance, but I do think the best way I can give it to you is in the context of kind of what we expect for the first half, and if you kind of plot out what I'm essentially saying, you're absolutely -- your variables are absolutely right. So a little bit of opportunity on the top line. But again, remembering that it's off the base and relative to what we would have experienced perhaps on the downside in Q1. So to kind of be right where we are guiding for the first half in totality. And I think for EBIT, we'll be roughly in that same bucket as what we're guiding for the year on the 52-week number on the EBIT side. And I do think that will flow through to EPS although, remember the big driver for the year as we look at the delta between EBIT and EPS is obviously the interest and as we expect to complete the divestiture process in Q2, that then will be the unlock for kind of accelerating EPS a little further. So take that into mind as you're thinking about how building those -- all those pieces back and to get to a Q2.","Chris Growe","That's great. That was good color.","Mark Clouse","[Indiscernible] without giving you quarterly guidance.","Chris Growe","That's fine.","Mark Clouse","Yes, hopefully that's helpful.","Chris Growe","I understand, that was helpful. Yes, thank you. Just one quick follow-up then on the gross margin. I just want to understand the -- is the inflation more front-end loaded through the year? How do you expect the gross margin to perform through the year? And I just want to overlay on that some of the promotional spending, does that kick up say in Q2 and Q3 just to have a little bit more of an incremental drag on the gross margins as I think about how you're investing back in the business here?","Mark Clouse","Yes, you know again, I think call it over the years of doing this. I'm always a little hesitant to direct the gross margin, but I do think the way I would expect the building blocks to work is, we do think inflation is a bit front-loaded. We do expect that to have some moderating effect over the balance of the year. The investment profile doesn't really have a major spike in any of the quarters. I mean, I think if there was a little bit more, it would be around this holiday period which kind of sits a bit in Q1 and Q2. So, there's a little bit of an uptick there as I talk about some of the investment in Snacks, in particular. So that might be a little bit of distortion early on, but I think for the most part we expect this kind of profile of an inflation rate that's a little higher than our base productivity offset by cost savings of which half will go to the business and again that half part is in gross margin part of it's in admin costs and then of course the other half of that cost savings is going into the investment. So that $140 million to $150 million, half of it is going to the bottom line spread between margin and below margin and the other half goes to fund the investment uptick that we're making. So that's kind of the way the year looks and for the most part I think on the gross margin side, you'll see pretty steady pacing through the year.","Chris Growe","Okay. Again, very good color. Thanks so much for your help there.","Mark Clouse","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."],"3986":["Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) Q3 2012 Earnings Call May 21, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Jennifer Driscoll - Vice President of Investor Relations","Denise M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, CFO and Chief Administrative Officer; and Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance.","Denise will kick us off today with a strategic update followed by comments on our results for the third quarter. Craig will give you his overview of the quarter and first 9 months, as well as our expectations for fiscal 2012. Then after we take your questions, Denise will wrap up the call with a few closing remarks.","Before we go over the usual reminders, we'd like to invite all of our listeners to join our webcast next week on Wednesday, May 30, at 8 a.m. Eastern Time. We'll be webcasting Denise Morrison's presentation at the Sanford Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York.","Today, as usual, we've created slides to accompany our quarterly earnings presentation.

These slides, as well as our earnings release and selected quarterly financial data, also can be found on our website.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Denise.","Denise M. Morrison","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Campbell's Third Quarter Conference Call. Nine months into our transition, we remain confident and focused on executing our strategic plan and improving our performance across our 3 broad categories: simple meals, baked snacks and healthy beverages. We are making significant investments in our brands and developing a meaningful innovation pipeline to satisfy both our loyal core consumers and to capture the taste buds of new ones.","Before I became CEO last August, the Campbell leadership team examined the fundamentals of our entire company. We challenged the conventional thinking about our businesses and our strategies. The strategic framework we put in place at the beginning of this year is the foundation on which we build our growth plans. This was not a simple course correction. We are building a business for the long term.","This morning, I will provide my perspective on our execution as we continue to advance our 3 growth strategies. As many of you know, those strategies are: stabilize and then profitably grow North America Soup and Simple Meals; expand our international presence; and continue to drive growth in healthy beverages and baked snacks.","Under our new strategic framework, we have placed the consumer at the center of everything we do. In the quarter, consumers continue to be pressured, particularly in developed markets. This is the new reality we face. The story is a familiar one. Trips to stores are down, and dollars per trip are down, impacting the performance of food sales across the industry. In fact, many center store categories, particularly in the grocery channel, are facing significant growth challenges. Consumers are making different choices, including where they shop, what they purchase and how tightly they manage their food budgets.","Our overarching goal is to delight consumers with tasty, affordable, nourishing, convenient food and do it their way. Our consumer insights and understanding of key trends around culinary, taste, wellness, technology and globalization are having a profound impact on how we approach our business. These insights are fueling our innovation pipeline for fiscal 2013 and beyond.","In terms of brand building, we recognize that optimizing all of the drivers of demand will look different for each of our businesses depending upon the consumer, customer and competitive situation. In our U.S. Soup business, this means having the right combination of drivers, including advertising and consumer promotion, product quality, differentiated positioning of our brands, the right price value, trade promotion and, finally, distribution channels and placement on shelf.","Getting this right on our base business and executing with excellence is foundational to our growth. On top of a stable base business, the innovation agenda that we have set in motion will accelerate our growth over time.","This quarter, we significantly increased our long-term brand-building efforts across most of our businesses, with advertising and consumer promotion up 13%. As we announced in July, we targeted $100 million in new brand-building and innovation initiatives this year. This investment is critical for our future growth, and we are on track to spend that $100 million on new product launches, brand-building, R&D, funding our innovation teams and emerging markets.","At CAGNY, we shared some of the initial innovations resulting from this investment. We now have 52 new products going to market that we\u2019ll start to ship in quarter 4. Customers have responded favorably to the new products that we have planned. Although we had executed against our new initiative spending, our total advertising and consumer spending for the year is not as high as we originally planned due to our ongoing management of base spending in a tougher environment. For example, we have shifted some marketing expense to trade promotion in our Global Baking and Snacking businesses to address competitive issues.","Excluding currency, our total sales growth in the quarter was 1% compared to a year ago, which is also an improvement versus the first half. U.S. Beverages led the way with a 5% increase, driven by market share gains and new product introductions. Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 2%, led by Pepperidge Farm. Organic sales rose 2% in International Simple Meals and Beverages, and North America Foodservice sales were comparable with last year. U.S. Simple Meals declined 2%.","As we anticipated, our pullback in trade spending and price realization in a competitive arena had an impact on our sales of U.S. Soup. Having said that, I am not happy with our U.S. Soup performance this quarter. I know we can do better. We continue to review all aspects of the U.S. Soup business and anticipate making further execution adjustments based on new insights. The U.S. Simple Meals business is meeting our profit expectations but is not yet delivering top line growth.","In another part of the world, we continue to struggle in Australia with a difficult consumer and customer environment. We reiterated our guidance for F'12 today. The guidance reflects the strategic transition we are making and our investments in brand-building and innovation to change our top line trajectory. It also reflects the headwinds we are facing in the U.S. and Australia.","We will be near the low end of our guidance range for sales and adjusted EBIT and near the high end of the range for adjusted EPS. Bigger picture, we are establishing the foundation to drive long-term growth at Campbell.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for his analysis of our financial results and expectations.","B. Craig Owens","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. I'll spend a few minutes to review our third quarter results and segment highlights, and I'll follow that with a recap of our year-to-date results and finish by briefly discussing our full year guidance.","For the quarter, we reported net sales of $1.8 billion, comparable to the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of currency, organic net sales increased by 1%. We recognized some additional restructuring charges in connection with the program that we announced last June. Excluding that impact, operating earnings decreased 13% this quarter to $268 million. This was primarily due to cost inflation, increased marketing investment and lower volume, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements.","On a segment basis, sales gains in Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Beverages were offset by declines in U.S. Simple Meals and International Simple Meals and Beverages. Operating earnings were down across all of our segments.","Adjusted earnings per share were $0.56 this quarter, a 2% decline as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Earnings per share benefited from a lower tax rate at fewer shares outstanding, mostly offsetting the lower EBIT.","In the third quarter, our reported net sales were comparable to the prior year. Organic sales increased by 1%. You'll note that the detail on Chart 15 does not add due to rounding. As you can see on the chart, the increase in pricing of 3 points was offset by the negative impact of increased promotional spending of 2 points and a decrease in volume and mix of 1 point. The majority of the pricing gains have come from our list price actions in U.S. Soup and in our Baking and Snacking segment, taken to partly offset the impact of inflation. The promotional spending variance reflects the higher rates of spending in our Baking and Snacking business.","Our gross margin declined from 40.4% in the third quarter of 2011 to 38.8% in the current quarter, a decrease of 160 basis points. The decline was primarily due to cost inflation, increased promotional spending and unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements. Overall, our inflation rate and cost of goods sold was about 6% for the quarter. Our gross margin performance is below our own earlier expectations, primarily due to higher rates of promotional spending in our Baking and Snacking segment. The negative mix impact reflects our lower margin segments outperforming our higher margin segments.","Our marketing and selling expenses increased by 5% to $256 million compared with $243 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses, partially offset by lower selling expense. In the third quarter, advertising and consumer promotion expense increased by 13%, reflecting brand building investments across most of our businesses. Most notably, we significantly increased advertising in our U.S. Simple Meals segment, accounting for more than 1\/2 of this increase.","Administrative expenses decreased $4 million to $144 million, primarily due to the benefit of cost savings from restructuring initiatives.","As I noted earlier, adjusted EBIT declined 13% for the quarter. Below that line, net interest expense increased 13%, an increase of $3 million, reflecting a higher proportion of fixed-rate debt in the portfolio. The adjusted tax rate declined by 8.2 points to 26.1% from 34.3% in the prior year due to lower taxes on foreign earnings associated with revised dividend projections. Reflecting the lower tax rate, adjusted net earnings were down just 4%. Adjusted earnings per share declined 2%, benefiting from a 2% decrease in diluted shares outstanding.","Third quarter segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on Slide 18. U.S. Simple Meals sales declined 2%, driven by declines in U.S. Soup. U.S. Soup sales fell 3% this quarter as lower volumes were only partially offset by higher selling prices. Within U.S. Simple Meals, sales of U.S. Sauces were comparable to the third quarter of 2011, with Prego pasta sauce achieving a 3% volume-driven sales gain, benefiting from increased advertising support and new items. Sales of Pace Mexican sauce were comparable to prior year, while other simple meal brands declined.","Global Baking and Snacking segment sales increased by 2%, driven by growth in Pepperidge Farm. Pepperidge Farm sales increased, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Goldfish Snack Crackers, partially offset by declines in bakery and cookie products. Sales in Arnott's were comparable to prior year as strong growth in Indonesia was offset by a decline in Australia, driven by increased promotional spending.","Within the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment, organic sales increased 2% as higher sales in Canada, Europe and Latin America were partly offset by lower sales in the Asia-Pacific region. In Europe, sales increased due to volume-driven gains in France, partially offset by lower sales in Germany. And in the Asia-Pacific region, sales decreased primarily due to declines in Australian soup, partially offset by growth in Japan and Malaysia.","U.S. Beverages sales, which continue to outpace the category, increased 5% versus prior year. Sales increased, primarily driven by double-digit growth in V8 Splash beverages and gains in V8 V-Fusion beverages. Sales in the quarter benefited from a range of new products, including V8 V-Fusion Smoothies, V8 V-Fusion Sparkling Flavors and energy drinks.","Sales at North America Foodservice were comparable to prior year as volume-driven gains in fresh chilled soup sold at retail were offset by declines in frozen and canned soup.","Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals decreased by 14% to $120 million this quarter. This decline reflected lower earnings in both U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. Within the segment, lower volumes, cost inflation and increased advertising and consumer promotion expenses were partly offset by higher selling price and productivity improvements.","I mentioned higher selling prices in U.S. Simple Meals. Recall that we took a 5% increase across U.S. Soup in June 2011 due to significant inflation. We expect continued inflation, although at a more moderate level, in soup input cost for this next year. Consequently, we're taking another list price increase in June of 2012. The 5% list price increase applies only to condensed soup.","Earnings within Global Baking and Snacking declined by 11%, reflecting decreases in both Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the decline in gross margin percentage, driven by cost inflation and promotional spending, partly offset by higher selling prices.","Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages were down 17%, primarily due to the impact of cost inflation, increased promotional spending and higher advertising, partly offset by volume gains.","Within International Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings declined by 10%, primarily due to lower earnings in the Asia-Pacific region. Operating earnings within North American Foodservice decreased by $2 million or 9% versus the prior year.","U.S. Soup sales for the quarter decreased 3%. Within soup, sales of condensed soup decreased 5%, with declines in both cooking and eating varieties. RTS sales decreased by 1%, reflecting declines in microwavable soup, partly offset by the sales from the launch of Campbell's Slow Kettle soups. Canned RTS soup sales were comparable to a year ago.","Broth sales declined 4% as the decline in canned products were partly offset by the introduction of Swanson Flavor Boost concentrated broth.","The U.S. wet soup market share results for the latest 52 weeks based on IRI data and internal company estimates is shown here on Slide 22. Campbell's market share declined 2.3 points to 59.6%. The change was driven by ready-to-serve soup, and ready-to-serve, other branded players and private label had market share gains. Our U.S. Soup dollar sales declined 3.6%, while overall category sales were unchanged in dollars over the past 52 weeks. We underperformed the category as a result of our reduction in promotions and our list price increase, among other factors.  Other branded players increased sales by 7.9% in the period, while private label sales rose 1.8%.","For the first 9 months, reported net sales were comparable to prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, organic net sales decreased by 1%. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EBIT of $1 billion was down 8% versus a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to cost inflation, lower volumes and increased promotional spending, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity gains. Adjusted EPS declined 4% less -- by 4%, which was only about 1\/2 of the EBIT decline as we continue to benefit from our share repurchase program. Diluted shares outstanding fell by 3%.","Below the operating profit line, net interest expense fell 5% or $4 million to $81 million. This decline was primarily driven by lower rates on our long-term debt portfolio. The adjusted tax rate for the first 9 months of the year increased 10 basis points to 31.2%. We expect the full year tax rate to be between 31% and 32%, similar to last year.","For the first 9 months, net earnings declined 7%. And benefiting from a 3% reduction in diluted shares outstanding, EPS declined 4% to $2.03.","Cash flow from operations was $838 million compared to $858 million in the prior year period. The decline reflected the impact of lower earnings, partly offset by lower cash payments associated with pension and other benefit plans. Capital expenditures of $173 million were up from $133 million a year ago. For the year, we continue to forecast capital spending of approximately $325 million.","During the first 9 months of the year, we utilized our positive cash flow to repurchase 8.3 million shares at a cost of $272 million under our strategic share repurchase program announced in June of 2011 and our practice of buying back shares to offset those issued under our equity-based compensation programs. Net debt was $2.4 billion, a decrease of $282 million.","As noted this morning in the earnings release, we expect net sales growth of between 0% and 2%; a decline in adjusted EBIT of between 9% and 7%; and a decline in adjusted EPS of between 7% and 5%, putting the adjusted EPS in the range of $2.35 to $2.42. We expect improved sales performance and increased investment in brand-building and innovation in the fourth quarter. Based on these estimates, we expect to achieve our guidance, with sales and adjusted EBIT near the lower end of the range and adjusted EPS benefiting from a favorable tax rate near the upper end of the range. As previously mentioned, we expect the full year tax rate to be between 31% and 32%. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","At this time, we'll conduct the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Sean?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Aaron of RBC Capital.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just to start on the soup business, wanted to ask about the decision to take price on condensed but not on ready-to-serve. Is it -- is that maybe an indication that you feel like you've kind of gone too far this past year to try to better separate the relative pricing between condensed and ready-to-serve?","Denise M. Morrison","Ed, yes. We believe that the list price increase that we took on ready-to-serve, coupled with the pullback on trade spending, was enough this year and that increasing the price on that particular line of soup next year was not prudent. That said, we believe there is still pricing power on our condensed line.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just as a kind of a general follow-up to the soup business. I mean, Denise, do you feel like looking at kind of where you are year-to-date that -- you have this plan to stabilize and then grow the soup business. Do you think you've kind of hit the point of stabilization yet? Or do you think it's premature to kind of claim victory on that?","Denise M. Morrison","We have just hit the point of stabilization. I wouldn't declare victory yet, but we are largely where we expected to be year-to-date, despite the third quarter.","Jennifer Driscoll","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up to Ed's question. Just in terms of the price increase in condensed soup, Denise, can you just talk about what the interaction between ready-to-serve and condensed soups has been, I guess, through the course of this year and then just how you feel or think about the price gap right now between condensed and ready-to-soup (sic) [ready-to-serve]? And I guess my question is just simply, is there some risk that condensed bleeds market share to ready to soup -- ready-to-serve if you take a -- taking another price increase?","Denise M. Morrison","Well, first of all, on the price increase, pricing and productivity improvements must offset the inflation that we're going to experience next year so that we can invest in brand-building and innovation. We think that's very important. As we plan this, we are not crossing any key pricing thresholds, particularly on our icons. And we anticipate to maintain the normal price gaps between ready-to-serve and condensed, which would minimize the interaction between the 2 soup sub-categories. And of course, we'll watch this very closely as it plays out in the marketplace.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So you feel like you're at a good point right now in terms of the way those 2 have interacted with each other.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, we feel that we've made significant improvements since we've pulled away from the severe price discounting that we had last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask you, in any relation to some of the new products you have come out, they're more heavily focused on ready-to-serve. There\u2019ll be some more promotional spending behind those products next year. Is that at all a factor in this decision on pricing between condensed and ready-to-serve? And I guess, also I understand, with those new products, do you anticipate incremental shelf space for those products through the launch in early fiscal '13?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, Chris, let me take the last part of that question first. Obviously, we are introducing double the rate of new products that we had last year, and our sales team is working right now collaboratively with retailers to make sure that we get the proper shelf space to accommodate those products. So that's in the works, and the response has been very favorable by our customers. And we focus those new products largely on Millennials and their preferences, and so that's why we have more in the RTS line of soup than in condensed. But that said, we are working on introducing some new news to condensed soup as well, and we will continue to do that.","B. Craig Owens","I think the price increase or the lack of a price increase on RTS doesn't have much to do with the new products. For the most part, the new products will have independent pricing decisions against them. There'll be a few line extensions and new variety flavors in the existing RTS line, but it didn't play much into the decision about price increase.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer of UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Denise and Craig, I had a feeling from your previous communications that you were going to be looking at the second half of this fiscal year as more of a clear view about the momentum in your business. Do you feel like this quarter is a pretty good judgment quarter for you as you look at your business and your brand momentum? Or do you think there was still some noise in there that we should be thinking about?","Denise M. Morrison","I think that the momentum is better on our beverages and our baked snacks businesses and our sauce businesses. I don't think the momentum is better on Australia. And I think it's better than it was, but it's still not all the way where we want it to be. And in our soup business, we're about where we would -- we expect it to be on a year-to-date basis. And we are optimistic that as we introduce the new innovation, going forward, we'll start to pick up accelerations in our growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My question is regarding the effectiveness of your marketing spend, especially in light of some of the issues you discussed relating to the center of store category. So you talked about, I think, something like 52 new products. I mean, what are you doing differently in terms of your innovation to increase the effectiveness of your brand-building efforts? Because clearly, the level of your brand-building, it seems like you've taken it down on your base business.","Denise M. Morrison","The effect of our increased marketing support was mixed. We had, as I said, much better performance in beverages, baked snacks in Canada. And I think it's fair to say that we're constantly looking at the efficiency and effectiveness of our advertising and consumer promotion. And we also have an awareness that there are multiple drivers of demand that need to be balanced, and that balance could look different based on the business. So in our soup business, we had increased advertising and consumer promotion. However, with the pullback on trade promotion and the increased price that the consumer realized, we don't believe that we struck the right balance this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Craig, I think you said the adjusted tax rate declined in part because of lower taxes on foreign earnings associated with revised dividend projections. Is that correct?","B. Craig Owens","That's correct.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What does that mean exactly?","B. Craig Owens","It means that we have, through a combination of cash and tax planning, determined that we can forgo some of the dividend activity that we had previously planned from our foreign subsidiaries, which saves us on the dividend tax rate. And we still feel like we'll be able to hit our cash flow targets.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So dividend is back to the parent, not dividends to shareholders, right?","B. Craig Owens","That's correct.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, Denise, I'm curious about your comment that the condensed soup business has pricing power right now. And given the difficult volume environment, I must admit I just don't understand quite the commitment to high margins when the business is shedding volume a little bit. I would have thought you needed to go the other way, that is, take prices down to eat some margins. Because you are earning, I don't know, 30% margins, maybe more, when the food industry average is closer to 10%, 15%, and your condensed volumes are heading the wrong way. So if you could just help us understand that a little bit more. I know we\u2019re beating this a little bit down, but I'm just curious to follow up there.","Denise M. Morrison","Well, in looking at the categories in simple meals, most of those categories have had substantial increases in prices over the past couple of years, predominantly due to increases in cost inflation, and we have had the same. And we believe that we need to at least cover cost inflation between productivity and pricing so that we are able to effectively spend back in brand-building with the consumer and increasing our innovation. And we believe that condensed soup could -- is still a very, very good value relative to other simple meals in the grocery store. And as long as we can maintain the balance of pricing and advertising and new product news, we believe that the consumer will respond to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So in the release, you highlighted some improvement in soup sales during the quarter in Canada, where I believe you're moving toward a similar strategic approach of lower promotional spend, higher innovation, similar to what you're doing in the U.S. Is there a clear divergence in how your soup business is performing there relative to the U.S. or how consumers are responding to the brand-building efforts? And if so, what do you think is driving that?","Denise M. Morrison","I think in Canada, they have a different balance of advertising, consumer and merchandising. And that worked very effectively for them this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess one question, one follow-up, kind of related to Ken's question. I mean, Denise, just speaking more broadly for the industry, I mean, aren't we in this just kind of intractable problem of inflation and raised prices, alienate the consumer to a certain extent and then try to advertise back? But it seems with volumes down across the industry, that the advertising isn't doing what it's intended to do.","Denise M. Morrison","I think that the advertising has worked better on condensed than it has on RTS this year. The amazing campaign has driven condensed consumption to where we planned it to be. I think that the advertising on RTS has not been as differentiating as we thought it would be, so we have to make our course corrections there. I actually walked a store this weekend and looked at some of the different pricing on simple meals, all the way from frozen entr\u00e9es to cereal to perimeter offerings, et cetera. And it is astonishing how good a value our condensed soup is relative to some of those other items. In fact, we're right up there with candy bars. So I do believe that we need to watch it in the marketplace, but I really believe that it's very important that we keep advertising and promoting with the consumer and incenting them with new recipes and ideas for usage of this product. And that's going to take money, and so we need to invest that money back in the brand-building.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Craig, did you -- you talked about the inflation in the quarter. You said you were going to have inflation next fiscal year, which is, again, why you're raising prices on condensed. What percent increase are you expecting for F'13? And what are the drivers of that? Because it seems as if most inputs are, at least on a spot basis, down year-over-year.","B. Craig Owens","Yes, I think you're right, Eric. I think the inflation that we're anticipating for next year will be lower than this year. If you\u2019ll remember, we said this year would be something like 7% or 8% on input cost, leading to a total inflation number of around 6%. And we would expect a lower number for next year but probably still a number that will be ahead of the 3% or so that we look at as kind of a long-term guideline as to what we can absorb through productivity and enabler savings. So we'll give a more precise inflation forecast as we get closer to the year, but that kind of gets you in the ballpark of what our thinking is and why a price increase.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And is there something specific that's driving the 3% to 6% range?","B. Craig Owens","It's a little bit across the board. We don't see any of the key inputs to the soup business that we think would be significantly down, and I think we see a range of increases across both packaging and ingredient cost.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Denise, I found one of your comments interesting at the outset where you said you were really reviewing all aspects of the U.S. Soup business and to expect some further execution adjustments. And I don\u2019t know, that sounded a little bit more like -- and I know you have obviously some change in leadership and such who will want to look at their own perspectives on this. But it sounds like there's still the potential for some significant shifts or course corrections in the way you're, at least, executing in U.S. Soup. And I guess I just wanted to follow up on that and see -- maybe I'm reading too much into that, or if I'm not, if we could dig down a little bit on maybe some of the key buckets maybe of where those execution adjustments need to be or whatever you can kind of share with us at this point.","Denise M. Morrison","I think, Andrew, suffice it to say that we've been working on 2 paths. One is really jump-starting our innovation pipeline, which in Soup and Simple Meals was woefully under the average, and we've been very encouraged by the progress that we're making there. The second is really to make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned as we look at the fundamentals of our base businesses. And so when I talk about the drivers of demand, that's not only trade promotion and advertising and consumer promotion, but it gets all the way into product. It gets into offerings. It gets into shelves. It gets into distribution channels. And so we are and we'll be working on our operating plans as we speak, like I said, looking at our base business with a lot of detail to make sure that we get the right balance of all these drivers of demands to drive growth.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. I think it's a matter of, I guess -- a question was asked earlier also about what did you learn so far from this soup season that either makes you think you're on track for sort of next fiscal year or whether there still needs to be a lot done. And obviously, it sounds like you're more encouraged on the new product side early days, but some things obviously on the core that still needs to be sort of figured out?","Denise M. Morrison","Well, I wouldn't say that it has to be figured out. I think we've got a good line of sight to get better results on the base business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question on beverages. I think this year was supposed to be an investment year to fend off competition. And as a result, operating margins are down from 24% last year to maybe around 18% or 19% this year. Do you think that you've achieved what you set out to do? And do you think that in fiscal '13, we could look for margins going higher? Or is this kind of like where you think margins need to be to keep growing the business?","Denise M. Morrison","In the Beverage business, we still see weak shelf stable juice category trends. However, our beverages have been performing and gaining share. And so the beverage business has responded, particularly our V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash beverages, to the investment that we've made in this business. That said, we recognize that, that has come at a cost. And going forward, we will strike a balance to get back to profitable growth in beverages, with the momentum of new products and continued brand-building, which is now in our base.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up, how do you think your competition has reacted to the aggressive activities you've put into the marketplace? Has it cooled off a little bit?","Denise M. Morrison","I wouldn't say that the grocery store in general has cooled off. And particularly in the beverage aisle, it has not cooled off. So we expect that the industry is going to remain very competitive, but we believe that we have the brand proposition to deal with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So at the beginning of the presentation, you mentioned that consumers are shopping in new channels. We've had some other packaged food companies say that up to maybe 5% of U.S. sales are now coming from the dollar store channel. Obviously, other companies are a lot, lot lower than that. And we've also got companies like Heinz really trying to target those dollar kind of price points to get in there with a lot of new SKUs. Could you just speak to what your strategy is with regard to that very fast-growing channel right now?","Denise M. Morrison","There's no question that there has been more growth in some of the value channels this year relative to grocery. That said, we are underdeveloped in a number of those channels. And part of our innovation pipeline is to make sure that we're developing our business across all channels so that as consumers shop different places, they will find the availability of our products.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So we'd actually hear about you putting SKUs into those stores as part of the new product lineup or -- sometime soon?","Denise M. Morrison","We offer products to all channels so -- but like I said, our business tends to be more skewed towards the mainstream channels at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Quickly on the spend level this year, the $100 million. I think you mentioned a couple of times that you're still on track to spend there. You just had to make some tactical adjustments in terms of how you spent it and where you spent it. You've got a lot of innovation coming to market next year. Do you -- as we look at the marketing and selling expense line here at P&L, are you happy with where it is as a percentage of sales? Or do you think it needs to move up materially higher to support all the new launches?","Denise M. Morrison","Well, I think that what we're seeing on a year-to-date basis is that we were down on our marketing expense in first quarter as we pulled back on nonproductive marketing expense that we had in our base. And our A&C in quarter 2 was up 6%. Our A&C in quarter 3 was up 13%. We have readied many new products to go to market. We've shifted a lot of resources inside Campbell's to form these breakthrough innovation teams and fully staff them so that there's a pipeline even beyond F'13 being built. So I think we've made in a short period of time -- remember, this has been 9 months. In a short period of time, we've made significant progress and kept the integrity of investing that $100 million in the new initiatives that we talked about last July.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","What don't we see in the P&L then? Because if we look at the P&L year-to-date, marketing and selling expense up $3 million, R&D down $4 million, we don't see any of it there. Are there offsets that we just don't have visibility to?","Denise M. Morrison","Yes. There have been offsets in the Global Baking and Snacking businesses, both in Pepperidge Farm and in Arnott's, to meet competitive situations. There has been some reallocating of marketing expense, which moved to above the line, and that's part of the reason why our gross margins were down.","Anthony P. DiSilvestro","The other thing you see on the P&L within the selling and marketing line, if you'll recall in the fourth quarter of last year, we announced a pretty significant restructuring program. And the benefits of that are hitting both the administrative expense line, and also selling expense, which sits within selling and marketing, is down year-on-year.","Denise M. Morrison","Thanks, Anthony, for adding to the answer there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","My question is just again a little bit more focused on the balance sheet and kind of if we look at results today, what's happened overall, obviously, in the soup business for the past few years. I'm just trying to gauge as we look at Q4, should we be -- should we expect potentially a little bit more aggressive stance on buyback activity kind of going into Q4 next year? And I just ask the question because, if I look year-over-year, kind of look at the trend in your buyback activity relative to your balance sheet strength, it just doesn't seem like you're buying back that much stock, and I thought you would be.","B. Craig Owens","Yes, Rob, we've typically -- well, we've said and we have typically acted against the notion that the buyback program would be sort of the last piece or the lowest priority in terms of reinvestment to the extent that we can reinvest in our business, our existing business, that's first; and to the extent that we can find attractive external development projects, that would be second. And then we have sort of a philosophy of maintaining a pretty steady approach to payout ratio and our dividend. And then to the extent that we have excess cash, we tend to use that in our buyback program. And that's -- I mean, it's a little up and down by quarter. But broadly across time, I think that's what you would expect to see. We are not looking to significantly change the leverage in our balance sheet one way or the other with our share repurchase program.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","And would that be the same for any type of potential acquisitions like you, again, aren\u2019t looking to significantly change your leverage?","B. Craig Owens","Well, I think that would then depend on the size of the acquisition, the opportunity that we saw available. So no, it wouldn't necessarily be the same answer on acquisition.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Lash of Morningstar.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I had a follow-up on the breakdown of marketing versus promotional spending. And I know that you've been focusing on marketing spending, specifically within the soup business. But obviously, you talked in this quarter about the increased promotional spending behind the Global Baking and Snacking segment. And I was wondering if you -- what your expectations were of that spending going forward and, just overall, the breakdown between marketing versus promotional spending from a consolidated perspective.","Denise M. Morrison","Yes, there isn't a single answer on the breakdown of marketing versus promotional spending. Again, each business, depending upon its situation, will have to strike the right balance of what that looks like going forward. That said, in our Baking and Snacking businesses, as they faced more competition in the marketplace, they made choices to -- we still spent advertising and consumer, but they made choices to reallocate some of those funds to more competitive promotion in the marketplace.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So is the promotional spending in Global Snacking and Baking more effective than its -- than in U.S. Soup for instance?","Denise M. Morrison","See, we've been very pleased with the investment in advertising and consumer, particularly on our Goldfish brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I know you won't give your fiscal '13, obviously, earnings guidance until the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering if there are any other, let's say, discrete sort of puts and takes that we should think about, not quantifying but just buckets that we ought to at least think about from an expectation standpoint that affect things or you think will affect things next year one way or the other, whether it's pension or, obviously, costs as you talk about from an inflation standpoint, but other things that might be harder for us to just see at this stage, that we just want to take into consideration.","B. Craig Owens","Yes, Andrew, there are a lot of moving parts, as you know, and I hesitate to pull out 1 or 2 of those and get people focused on those moving parts and not on others. I mean, on pension, I guess the biggest driver for everybody that has a pension plan will be the fact that discount rates are falling, and so we'll have to watch that. But I really don't want to get into shining a light on particular pieces of the puzzle this early in the game, and we'll kind of continue the dialogue around F'13 at our Analyst Day in July.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Investment.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two quick follow-ups. The first one is on the advertising. Craig, when you laid out at CAGNY and, Denise, when you laid this out at CAGNY, you put the pie chart up and you showed something like 25% of that $100 million to go into A&C spending for the year, so about $25 million. Do you still expect to hit that? And then on slotting fees for all the new products, do any of those fee expenses show up in the fourth quarter? Or will all the slotting fees really show up in F'13?","B. Craig Owens","To answer the second question first, there's almost always some of the slotting activity that shows up in the prior year, so you should expect some of the slotting expense to be in the -- that would show up in this quarter. I think that as we think about the $100 million, probably of that $100 million, more than 25% of it would be in marketing by the time we get to the end of the year, either marketing support of new product introduction or new product initiatives or marketing support against the brand building initiatives in some of the key areas that we have focused on this year.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So above and beyond just A&C, you're saying. So I thought the chart had said $25 million to A&C.","B. Craig Owens","Yes, and I'm saying I think more than $25 million to A&C.","Denise M. Morrison","25%, yes.","Operator","Our final question comes from Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Did you, Craig, give an update on gross margin guidance for the year? Is it still down 100 basis points? And then as you look to fiscal '13, I know you don't want to talk about it much, but to what degree does condensed volumes probably being down from the price increase impact manufacturing efficiencies?","B. Craig Owens","So with respect to gross margin, you're right. We have sort of pulled our gross margin expectation down as we've gone through the year. Obviously, we're able to -- against our guidance, to pretty well offset that. We're still looking at being, as we said in the -- both the release and in the script, we're looking to be within our guidance. But I suppose that for the quarter, we were down about 160 basis points. And as we look forward for the full year, we would expect to be down probably a little bit more than that 100 basis points at gross profit for the full year. With respect to F'13, again, I mean, we're just -- we're not at the point of giving guidance for F'13 yet, so we'll hold that one.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So you think maybe down 120 for fiscal '12?","B. Craig Owens","That's probably closer, yes.","Denise M. Morrison","Thanks for the questions, and thanks to all of you for your attention. In closing, we've made solid progress towards reinvigorating our innovation pipeline. We remain committed to our long-term growth strategies, and we recognize the need to continually refine our execution to drive improved performance. We firmly believe that meaningful, consumer-focused innovation, excellence in brand-building and expansion into high-growth segments and geographies are the recipe to maximize long-term shareholder value and create a meaningfully different Campbell over time. With that, I'll turn it back to Jennifer.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Denise, and thank you, all of you, for your participation on our third quarter earnings webcast.
