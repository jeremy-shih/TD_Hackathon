We hope to see many of you there.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon.","In our second quarter of fiscal 2015, Applied delivered our highest quarterly revenue in the past three years and earnings near the top of our guidance range. These results reflect robust customer investment in both semiconductor and display, and most significantly that Applied is delivering the enabling products and services our customers need as they transition complex new devices into volume production. The magnitude of the technology change facing our customers is unprecedented, and this creates incredible opportunities for Applied Materials now and in the future.","Our core competencies and unmatched talent in materials engineering provide a great platform for profitable growth. Applied has a compelling strategy. We are investing in that strategy and making meaningful progress towards our goals. The traction we are demonstrating is made possible by our employees' relentless focus on moving the company forward and their tremendous passion to create value for customers and investors.","Over the past few years, we have been driving significant changes across the company, strengthening our capabilities and processes while aligning the organization to take advantage of our vast opportunities. We have aggressively shifted spending within the company to better support our customers, provide additional fuel for product development, and improve our financial performance.","By increasing investment in key areas, we have created a pipeline of differentiated products that will accelerate Applied's growth, and we are already seeing a positive impact. Starting with semiconductor equipment business, the trend is clear. We are winning market share. Over the past two years, we have increased our overall share in wafer fab equipment around 1.5 points. And, based on our current view of customer spending, we expect to build on those gains this year.","Our traditional leadership businesses, where we have high share, remain strong. And in 2014 we added around three points of share in both PVD and epi. We have our strongest momentum in areas of the market that represent large growth opportunities for us. Our combined revenues in CVD and etch were up over 50% year over year, significantly outgrowing the market. This past year we gained two points of share in CVD, and we have highly differentiated products in our pipeline that will expand our addressable market. We are very excited about how our new products are positioned, and we'll provide more details about our progress at our analyst meeting in July.","Since 2012, we gained seven points of market share in etch, including 12 points in conductor etch. In the past two quarters, the installed base for our latest generation etch system has grown from 10 chambers to more than 160. This is one of the fastest adoption rates for any new Applied product, and customers are telling us they see technical advantages in uniformity and defect performance. We believe our technical position is getting stronger, and this provides a foundation for future share gains.","We are also driving growth in our service business, where we delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue, and we're on track for a record year. At both the leading and trailing edge, our customers face incredible challenges as they strive to bring new innovations to market faster and more efficiently. By helping our customers solve their device performance, yield, and cost challenges, we believe that service can be a meaningful component of our long-term growth. We have adapted our strategy, strengthened our team, and are bringing together capabilities from across the company to deliver expanded service offerings that provide more value for our customers.","Service and spare parts revenues have grown more than 17% from this time last year. During this period, we have significantly increased the number of tools under service contract, which we believe is one indicator of our growth potential.","Turning to display, we expect 2015 to be a third consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth, and to increase our overall share by about two points. As we've highlighted before, our revenue and margin profiles in this business can be uneven. While we see some margin headwinds in 2016 due to customer mix and a weak yen, overall market trends remain positive.","As the display industry introduces new technologies, customers' manufacturing processes are becoming more complex and capital intensive. We have invested in a strong portfolio of products aimed at enabling next-generation TVs and mobile displays. One example of this is organic LED, which expands our served available market. We recently received a large order for our OLED encapsulation tool, and in 2015 we expect to book about $200 million in this new application.","Overall, our growth trajectory in semi and display is supported by a sustained period of industry investments in both capacity and technology. Even after recent customer announcements have been taken into account, we still believe 2015 wafer fab equipment investment will be up slightly over 2014, driven by increased memory spending. Sustained NAND bit growth in the 35% to 40% range, similar to 2014, enables these customers to maintain their investment levels. We expect 3D NAND to represent more than 40% of NAND investment in calendar 2015, and installed capacity should exceed 120,000 wafer starts per month by year end, which is only around 10% of total NAND capacity. This inflection not only increases our available market, but is also enabling us to gain share. Based on the positions we have won, we believe that in the transition from planar to 3D NAND, we will increase our served market share by at least five points at these customers.","In DRAM, supply and demand remain well balanced, and we anticipate bit growth of 25% to 30%. We are expecting this to translate to an increase in customer spending of 15% to 25% relative to 2014. These investments are primarily focused on 20-nanometer upgrades for mobile DRAM with some capacity additions.","In foundry, the leaders are engaged in a fierce battle to ramp FinFET technology at the right yield and cost. The intense pressure for our customers to accelerate volume production of their FinFET devices is a major area of focus for Applied and creates a great growth opportunity over the next few years.","In summary, our customers are making incredible advances in technology, enabled by materials innovation, and this plays directly to Applied's strengths. Across the company, we are making meaningful progress towards our growth goals and driving opportunities to accelerate our strategy. Going forward, we are prioritizing three areas to further improve execution.","First, we feel very positive about our new product pipeline and our ability to drive growth at Applied. In the near term, as we ramp these new products, we see some effects on our margins, particularly in cases where rapid adoption has exceeded our expectations. Bringing margin performance back in line with our financial model is a major companywide focus.","Second, we will continue to actively manage our product portfolio to ensure we are deploying our investments and resources towards our most promising growth opportunities. In the past two weeks, based on our view of future market potential, we have taken actions to further lower the breakeven level of our solar business.","And third, we are taking additional steps to optimize our structure, making sure that the organization is aligned to major areas of value creation for our customers and that we have the right talent in the right areas.","Now let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide additional detail about these priority areas and our financial performance.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Gary. I'll add my comments about how we're doing in the transition underway at Applied Materials. Gary talked about how we've moved money from headquarter functions and underperforming businesses to higher-growth opportunities, notably in etch, CVD, display, and AGS.","We've also strengthened the linkages between SSG and AGS for growth. SSG plus AGS revenue grew 20% in FY 2014, and we expect both businesses to outpace WFE in 2015. Focusing on the total life cycle of our products will increase both our revenue and profit growth. When excluding EES, Applied's trailing four-quarter revenue was the highest in seven years.","Now let's look at profitability. You'll recall that our non-GAAP gross margin was 40.9% in 2012, grew to 42.1% in 2013, and reached 44.1% in 2014, or 43.6% when excluding non-run rate items. Our progress is trending ahead of plan. This year, we've faced some headwinds due to mix and the higher initial cost of fast ramping new products. In Q1, our non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%. And in Q2, it increased to 43.2%, which was nearly a point better than our forecast. We expect gross margin to be flat to up a little in Q3.","Looking ahead to FY 2016, gross margin remains a key challenge to financial model performance. Within SSG, if we have similar demand in new product ramp patterns, we could experience gross margin headwinds in the first half. In display, Gary mentioned some of the margin challenges associated with the strong mobile ramp along with yen-based competition. However, leaders throughout the company are intensely focused on gross margin improvement. Based on our gross margin initiatives, we believe we can achieve year-over-year improvement in fiscal year 2016, but we expect it to be below model performance for the year.","We are equally focused on managing our operating expenses. Quarterly non-GAAP OpEx should be around $575 million through the end of this year. We have a number of new products to launch which require additional support, but we will stay focused on our cost structures and continue to optimize our portfolio investments. Last week, we further reduced our solar spending and we will continue to monitor the market closely.","Looking to our overall model, we continue to believe that non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 is the right level of profitability for the company when WFE spending is at $33.5 billion.","With the merger pending, we were unable to take certain actions, including share repurchases. Next week, we'll begin to buy back stock under our three-year, $3 billion repurchase authorization. We plan to be opportunistic, and we could execute the program in under two years. As the buyback and other initiatives take hold, we believe that we are on a path to $1.70 in 2017, assuming WFE demand of $33.5 billion. We'll share our detailed model with you at the analyst meeting in July.","Now I'll summarize our second-quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.5 billion were up 11%, led by SSG. Net sales of $2.4 billion were up 4%, which was above our expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin was 43.2%, which was better than expected due to a favorable customer mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $579 million, in line with guidance. Non-GAAP EPS at $0.29 was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash and investments, and about $2.8 billion of this was offshore.","In SSG, orders of $1.7 billion were at a three-year high and were up 19% on increases in foundry and NAND. SSG net sales of $1.6 billion were up 8%, at the high end of our expectations. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin grew by almost three points to 26.8%, driven by higher volume and a favorable product mix.","AGS orders of $641 million were down 7% sequentially due to a seasonal decline in service contract renewals. AGS orders were up 19% from the second quarter of 2014. AGS achieved record net sales of $646 million. The 11% increase was driven by growth in spares and services along with 200-millimeter equipment. AGS non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3%.","Display orders increased slightly to $120 million and net sales declined to $163 million, as expected. Display non-GAAP operating margin decreased to 24.5% on lower volume. EES orders were $50 million and net sales grew to $73 million, as expected. EES posted a non-GAAP operating loss of $4 million.","Now I will provide our third quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be up 2% to 6% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be up 3% to 8% sequentially. AGS net sales should be up 2% to 7%. We expect display net sales to be approximately flat, and EES net sales should be approximately $50 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35, which would be up 18% year over year at the midpoint.","Now let me turn the call back over to Mike for questions.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Kyle, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, Bob, first question is on the margins. If I think about what's going to be necessary to get you back in line with the target model, of the three, mix, scale, or lower component costs, how would you rank order those drivers in terms of the importance of getting your margin model back to where you want it to be?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'd say in the short to intermediate term, which is the next year and a half maybe, mix hurts us the most quarter to quarter. In terms of the second one, probably margin cost because most of our component costs, most of our product costs is materials. And then the third one is the scale issue, which is overhead absorption. Now longer term, if you can make progress on that. Those are time sequenced also.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. And then if I could follow up, Gary, on the 3D NAND ramp, it really seems like that's gaining some incremental traction in the back half of this year. What is it that's finally making customers feel more comfortable to ramp to 3D NAND? Is it that yields are where they need to be? Is it that the opportunity in enterprise solid-state drives is bigger? Is it just the customers trying to make sure one doesn't get too far ahead of the other? What's really \u2013 why are we starting to see this inflection because it's been a while in the making? Thank you.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good question, Jim. The yield was certainly a big challenge. This is the biggest change in memory technology in decades, going from planar scaling to 3D. So that was a big, big challenge. All of the customers were focused on making the transition, as we had discussed before, but the yield is getting to the point where more volume is going towards 3D NAND. All the customers have been focused with heavy technology investments in that area, but more customers now are moving to that technology and to manufacturing, so that certainly is a big transition. And what we said for Applied Materials is that the transition from planar to 3D NAND is really good for our business because planar is more litho-intensive and 3D NAND is more in the sweet spot of materials engineering types of technologies, etch, deposition. We have additional epi steps there.","So we talked about the opportunity for us on an equivalent wafer start basis going up 35% to 50%. And what we're seeing, we are very optimistic more towards the top end of that range relative to the opportunity for us in growth. And the other aspect is not only is the TAM increasing, but we believe that we will increase, as I talked about in the script, our share of that TAM. So that's another incremental growth driver for us within Applied. So we see the 3D NAND ramping certainly in 2015, and then really the majority of spending in NAND beyond 2015 is really towards 3D NAND. We also said that the capacity for 3D NAND is really 10% of total NAND capacity by the end of this year. So there's still opportunity as customers make that transition and really good tailwinds for us in terms of TAM and market share.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's really helpful. Thank you so much, good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, can you walk through your latest thoughts on linearity first half\/second half in terms of you and industry shipments?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. We think the second half is a little stronger than the first half. And we think particularly, we think foundry is up second half versus first half. I'm doing revenues. DRAM is a little softer. NAND is stronger, and logic is about neutral.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","That's very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, as you look at the handoff from DRAM to NAND going first half to second half, can you walk through what your intensity looks like in one sector versus the other, and also how we should think about the implications to gross margins? Thank you.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","If you look at it historically, in the last year or so our share in DRAM versus NAND overall is comparable. If you go look at the transition though at NAND, as Gary said earlier, growth in 3D for a company like Applied, we said 35% to 50% increase in the greenfield; it's probably a little more even. And if you look at our share gains, they're about five points in that transition, so we gained five points of that TAM. So the transition from DRAM to NAND \u2013 2D NAND is somewhat better for us. The transition to 3D is substantively better for us.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the other thing I would say is that we're gaining share in memory in both NAND and DRAM. Last quarter, what we had discussed was we had our highest DRAM orders since 2010. We actually exceeded that this quarter. So for the last two quarters, the DRAM business for us is up significantly, and we are gaining share in both of those different areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, a couple things. I guess, Bob, first a question on OpEx. Did I hear you say that OpEx will be down $35 million quarter on quarter between April to July?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I said it would be about $575 million.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","$575 million, okay, all right. Then I guess to follow on to that, if you look at that element relative to your financial model, that seems to be the area where, given where your revenue is, that's the line item that is the most out of whack. So either you have to grow revenue without growing OpEx or you have to cut OpEx to bring that in line to where revenue is. So can you just talk about that? Can you talk about which of those two you think is more likely? Thanks.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, the model was a 2016 model, so we actually see revenues growing next year. We think this year is probably a little under a $33 billion year for WFE. Next year the model is at $33.5 billion, so WFE is a little better in that model. Second, we think our share will be up in WFE this year and next somewhat. And then we think AGS is showing good growth momentum. And display should be pretty good in revenues next year. So we think the revenues could be an uptick and approach the model next year.","In terms of the biggest discrepancy, in my opinion, frankly, is a little bit of gross margins. 44.5% was the model. If you look at the document, it said 45%, but the math is 44.5%. We're up to 44.1% in fiscal 2014. The quarter just ended, we were at 43.2%. We go up a little bit maybe the second half, but in the first half if etch is heavy and there are a little bit of display mix problems, we're not up. So I'd say the biggest delta is probably the gross margin line.","If you look at expenses, we're at $575 million. If we hold at that line, which is what we're saying, then we'll be at $2.3 billion. The model is $2.2 billion to $2.8 billion, so we're $72 million over. But a lot of that's related to all the new products coming out. I think the biggest discrepancy is probably the gross margin line, personally.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tim.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, Bob. Thanks much. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. My first question is regarding the backlog. I saw that there were some debookings in the quarter. Can you talk about what those were? And was some of the impact from the recent cuts that we have seen from TSMC and Intel?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. The backlog, there were some debookings of stuff that either slipped out of the quarter or turned around. There was cats and dogs in there too, frankly. There was a little bit of foundry, some of the miscellaneous. Foreign exchange was $10 million of that, so that was just FX. So I wouldn't draw too many conclusions on it.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it, and then another long-term question, just talking about the balance sheet structure. Have you given any thought to what level of debt you need or you can support on the balance sheet and try to recapitalize your balance sheet and return some cash to shareholders?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We've given a lot of thought to everything, especially the last few weeks, in looking at the $3 billion. We think \u2013 I'm actually pretty optimistic we can get the $3 billion done in less than two years. I'm actually reasonably optimistic that we can continue a significant buyback for a number of years without going into heavy debt. I think we'll go into moderate debt, but I'm actually getting optimistic on the tax and the cash flow. And then if we need to take on some debt to continue significant share returns to investors, we're willing to look at that too, and we plan to do some of that too. But I'm actually getting more optimistic on the foreign cash lately.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you, that's all I have.","Operator","Your next questions comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question, two of them, first one for either Bob or Gary. As you look ahead and focus on both trying to gain share and renewed focus on gross margin, I'm curious. Is there going to be a difference in the pricing philosophy for the company? Are you going to look at pricing differently, be more rational, or is it going to be status quo? I'm just curious on that, and I also had a follow-up after that.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me talk a little bit about the model. Tim had asked this question earlier. In semi, we're very optimistic. We talked about the growth in our business as these new memory technologies are ramping into production. And certainly in FinFET first generation, 10-nanometer, that's a great opportunity for us with the products we have enabling those transitions. We gained 1.5 points over the last two years. We indicated we believe we'll gain share again this year. And as these transitions ramp, we're still in the early innings in terms of some of these transitions in the semiconductor area. So we're optimistic in that area.","Display, I talked earlier today about three years of double-digit gains in revenue in the display market. Again, there are major technology transitions there. We talked about a new area where that generated $200 million in revenue \u2013 will generate $200 million in revenue this year. So again, we have some good growth opportunities in display. And service, our service and spares was up 17% in our service and spares from last year, record revenue. So we have really good growth opportunities.","So when you look at the model, the top line revenue growth, if you look at where we were when we published that model to where we think we'll be, we're going to be in the range of that number for top line revenue growth, which was an incredible accomplishment versus what we said we would do. We still believe these opportunities are great opportunities for us. One of the things I also talked about was in etch, we went with a \u2013 we're introducing a new chamber that customers are telling us technically has advantages in uniformity and defect performance. But as you're ramping these many new areas simultaneously, we have great, great new products that are targeted at these inflections. There's going to be some margin pressure with startup in some of these areas, and frankly they're going even faster than we had expected due to the pull from the customers. The key thing in any business is to have value, technical value, and differentiation you're delivering to our customers.","So our focus is to enable these inflections for our customers in semiconductor and display. And in that process, we will drive market share higher, and hopefully the value for the customer with these differentiated products will also go up over time. As Bob had said earlier, in 2016, due to mix, we believe that the margins are going to be behind. But we are still driving to achieve those margin goals. The timing may be a little bit later than what we had talked about, but the momentum for the company relative to revenue growth is in the range of what we discussed when we published the model. And again, the margins are going to be off, as Bob talked about. But we are driving. There are a number of opportunities for us to drive, to close and exceed that gap from a gross margin standpoint.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, guys. And then just as a follow-up along the same path, if I look at SSG products, the one that has the biggest potential for share gain is conductor etch, but that also looks like it has probably one of the lower gross margins. Will the conductor etch product, do you think, get to the same level as some of your other dominant products like PVD, or do you think that it's going to be structurally a lower gross margin product division?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Over time, we see a lot of opportunity for us to drive higher margins in that business. Certainly, the share gains over the last couple years have been pretty significant. Our business went from I think 2012, from $350 million to about $1 billion last year, so just dramatic gains in the etch business. We think over time there's still a lot of upside potential. And it really, as I said, comes back to how are you technically positioned in the markets. And there are some significant advantages that customers are seeing. It's in the early innings of that being validated with customers. But you really look for architectural advantages in your products where you can solve high-value problems for customers in these inflections. We believe there are those areas that we can drive over time, and certainly a lot of opportunity for us to improve our margins in that area.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks, Gary.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Krish.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks for taking my question and good job on the results. Gary, if I look at the foundry spending at one of your customers that cut their CapEx, if I look at the CapEx and divide it by the capacity, the CapEx per year at capacity is flat over last year, and that's partly because the 20-nanometer demand wasn't strong and they were re-using more equipment. So my question is it if I look at 10-nanometer, how should we think about that ratio of CapEx to capacity as you move to 10-nanometer for the equipment makers?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So 10-nanometer is \u2013 we'll talk more about this at SEMICON. I've heard some customers say that this is the most important node in the history of their company. So you look really at where the pull is from an end user perspective in terms of mobile devices. Certainly there is a lot of value. People are trying to pack more performance, more features, and drive lower power for those devices. So 10-nanometer is a big battle for all of the different companies, and there is tremendous focus there, and the engagement with the customers are very deep and very broad.","When we look at the opportunity for the CapEx, if you take equivalent number of wafer starts, it goes up a significant amount versus what we're looking at for the 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer node. We'll talk more about this at SEMICON. But it is a great opportunity, and there is a significant change in that device as the customers are ramping 10-nanometer, and we look at that being a great opportunity for us. In the transistor area, we have more epi steps, real strength in PVD, implant, a number of different areas, and then also the interconnect structures there will also change. So this, as we've said many times, is the sweet spot relative to materials engineering. And we look at 10-nanometer being a really, really great opportunity to drive our business over the next few years. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything else on that one.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Maybe I could, if you don't mind. If you want to look at some of this capital intensity and reuse and nodal transitions, you have to look at three things really. One is, what's the relative capital intensity of the node? Two, where are they in the transition to a node? And three, how big is the node? So what is worrisome to some people right now is gee, they're getting a lot of reuse, and is that not as good for you on capital intensity? I'm not actually too worried.","If you look at the data, we think this year is probably a $33 billion year. And if you adjust for foreign exchange with the weaker yen and weaker euro, it's probably north of $33.5 billion. So the year is pretty good. Now look at what they're spending on. For three years in a row, 2012 to 2013, 2013 to 2014, and 2014 to 2015, the percentage of the spending that is going to companies like Applied, actually Applied, has gone up as a percentage of 100%. So this PME thing is really taking traction.","Third, if you look at where they are in the nodal transition, 16-nanometer to 14-nanometer they're pretty early. 20-nanometer wasn't a big node and they're doing some reuse. But if you look at it as they get later into the node, the percent of reuse probably goes down somewhat. And two, as Gary said, 10-nanometer is a big node. And if you look at the capital intensity, which we'll talk to you more about at Analyst Day, it looks like 10-nanometer mix again plays for companies like us. So I'm actually not too upset about the nodal transition or the mix for us.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, that's very helpful. And as a follow-up, Bob or Gary, your services growth is outstanding if I compare it to the wafer start growth, which is about 3% to 4% year over year. Can you provide us a percentage of your install base that's currently under contract so we can see how much headroom you have?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","What I would say on the service contracts is that we are making really significant progress relative to service contracts. And all of those tools under contract really provide a great forward momentum for us in the service business. We've made a lot of changes relative to our strategy, our structure, bringing new talent into the organization, and also the connection between the service business and the semiconductor business units. We've relocated people. It's really stronger than ever in terms of those value roadmaps for customers. So that's translating into significant growth in our service and spares business, which I talked about earlier was 17% growth in service and spares year over year. And we believe there is a huge opportunity. If you look at the share, it's still very, very, very low. We have a lot of momentum there, and we think the growth opportunity there for us is significant.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Let me add something, connect the dots with a question that was asked earlier. The point question that was asked earlier is, can etch gross margins get to be where some of your higher product gross margins are? I think the answer is they can certainly improve from where they are. But even if you look at other etch companies in our industry, the overall etch gross margin is not as high as some of our other high gross margin business, higher-share businesses. But what is very attractive about etch is a few things. One, if you look at our growth in operating profits since 2012 in etch, it's outstanding in terms of what's dropped through to the bottom line. It's very good. Second thing is, if you look at etch in the aftermarket, and we're focused more and more at the total product lifecycle profitability of a business, etch is probably the biggest opportunity because these tools, as Gary said, many times eat themselves. So in terms of driving long term profitability and predictable profitability, etch is a very attractive business.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon and nice job on the quarterly execution, guys. As a follow-up to the previous question on 10-nanometer, it sounds like another solid move up in intensity for the Applied team. We've heard pilot production later this year to first half of next year. The question is, are you guys seeing the 10-nanometer spending in your order pipeline for this quarter, the July quarter, or is it more targeted to come into your order pipeline more in the second half of this year?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's really not amounting to a large number right now. And certainly the engagements that we have with the customers is really better than ever across all of our different products, certainly in the transistor area with epi, PVD, more epi steps. That's a great opportunity for us. And in the patterning space, one of the things that we did in the organization is pull all of the patterning groups together. So we have etch, the selected material removals, CVD, ALD. And the synergies there for us as we are delivering these new materials, our ability to deliver those materials and etch them and remove them, that's a great synergy that we're driving as part of the organization change that we made. So the opportunity for us there, the engagements we have are great leading indicators of where we're going to be when that ramps, and they're broader and deeper than we've ever had. But from a revenue standpoint right now, it's not a significant number for us. It's a very small number for us.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, okay. I was talking more about orders there. But I understand where you're going with that. And then on the NAND segment, obviously very strong orders, up I think 40% sequentially. How much of this order mix in the April quarter was 3D, or is it still being focused on planar? And I'm assuming that the 3D spending mix is moving higher here in the July quarter. Are you seeing this order trajectory spread across multiple customers?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","On NAND in total, we had a good bookings quarter, as you said, and we think it's pretty strong for the rest of the year, as we told you earlier. The second thing we told you earlier was by the end of the year we see 120,000 wafer starts installed, which is about 10% of overall capacity, up from about 60,000 last year at the end of last year. So we see a heavier weighting of the 3D in the second half spending.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Harlan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, Gary and Bob, just a follow-up question on the gross margin next year. So is the gross margin issue mostly because of the display margin headwinds and less from these new etchers? And what is the display margin issue? Is it mostly from this new OLED display win that you're just ramping for the first time?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","If you go look at it \u2013 I'm looking at the data actually so I can be more accurate. So if you look at it, we're a little more where we want to be. We'll be up next year, we believe, in SSG in absolute gross margin percentages, but not as far up as we want. Now the reason we're not getting as far as we want is mostly mix. The reason we're improving in absolute dollars is within each product we're doing better. But the mix is still a little bit off, particularly in the first half.","Within display, again, it's a mix thing that next year, our business predominantly for many years has been driven by TV equipment. So we sell equipment to make TV panels or TV screens. Next year is a disproportionate number of sales of very high, I think the highest ever, and probably the highest we will have for the foreseeable future sales of smaller screen sizes, which is a somewhat different mix of tools, somewhat different mix of customers. So that's just for cell phones mostly. And so that's the mix that's hurting us in display next year, and it's unprecedented in the volume.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks for sharing that. And my follow-up question is just a general question on multiple patterning. There seems to be a perception that once EUV tools are put into production, there will be a big decline in some of these etching deposition sales for multiple patterning. I was just hoping you could share your thoughts on this given the big EUV order that we saw recently. Thanks.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Stephen. I think our position on EUV is consistent with what we've said in the past. We think it's post-10-nanometer when you would start seeing any real volume on EUV. And so as we said, over the next few years, the real big driver for us will be the 10-nanometer node and maybe the second generation of the 10-nanometer node. That we anticipate to be a big node, a real important competitive battle for our customers. And we'll talk more about this at SEMICON, but really a great driver for us from a TAM standpoint.","EUV is out beyond that timeframe, so it's out beyond the next few years. And then the other aspect is when EUV comes in, we believe that we'll also come in potentially with multiple patternings. So the timeframe for EUV to the really have any impact on our business is out there several years, so we don't see anything really near term. And certainly again the big, big, big driver for us over the next, I would say, two to three years is going to be the 10-nanometer node and maybe the shrink of that node.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Gary, you've mentioned that revenue growth in this industry is hard to come by. And given that and the developments over the last couple of weeks, why can't you guys do better than the OpEx run rate of $2.3 billion?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not sure I completely understand the question. The revenue growth, as I talked about earlier, we have a lot of momentum around these inflections in semiconductor and display. And in semi, we gained 1.5 points over the last couple of years. We expect that we will gain share again this year. And as these new technologies ramp, we're still in the early innings in terms of the change in memory technology and the whole FinFET battle that is happening with our customers. So we're very optimistic based on the investments we've made and our teams that we will continue our momentum in growing our share of WFE in the semiconductor business through those transitions.","As I said earlier, in display, three years of double-digit revenue gains in the display business, so we have very good opportunities there. And also in display, that market is undergoing significant changes from a technology standpoint, including this new area in OLED that we're ramping. So again, we have a lot of confidence in the growth longer term in our display business, a great team. They're gaining share, and also we're expanding our TAM with these new applications. So that part we're very, very, very happy with the progress that we're making in all of the major parts of our business.","The OpEx question relative to the $575 million number where we're at right now, our number one focus is that we want to capture these inflections with our products, in semiconductor and display, and continue to grow the service business. And as I said earlier, we're pretty much on track for significant top line growth. If you looked at where we were at when we talked about the model versus the momentum that we have, we're in the range of what we talked about earlier for top line revenue growth. So as you said, it's really hard, but I am very proud of this team that we have at Applied and what we've been able to accomplish and the momentum that we have in these different businesses.","We will continue to look for opportunities to optimize the business. We moved hundreds of millions of dollars over the last couple of years into areas that will drive longer-term shareholder value. Bob talked about the action that we are taking in the solar business right now. There are probably more opportunities for us to continue to optimize the portfolio. And longer term, we will continue to look at structural changes that will lower our overall spending in the company and improve productivity. But in the next year, we are very, very focused on top line revenue growth. And as you said, that's very, very difficult to come by.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you for that. And one of the things you highlighted in your monologue was just the strength of the services business. And if I look at that as a percentage of SSG, it's around 41% attach rate. Is that the right way to think about it, services as a percentage of SSG? And is that 41% a number that you think you can improve on?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So again, the 17% growth in service and spares in the last year, so think about the service business around $2.5 billion. This year will be north of $2.5 billion. And I think in the model, we had something like $2.6 billion \u2013 $2.7 billion for...","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, the original model was only $2.561 billion.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","$2.561 billion. So anyway...","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We beat it.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we'll beat that. But if you can achieve double-digit revenue growth in service, as we are this year, that's $250 million \u2013 $300 million. That's almost 1% of WFE. So through a lot of changes in our strategy, our structure, we are increasing our service and spares business. We're adding value to the products. So that can be a great revenue driver as we're adding more value for our customers. So certainly, that's an area that the whole company is focused on is really creating more value for customers and then driving growth in that area.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Romit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much. Gary, first, in terms of the share gains you've garnered on the memory space, can you give a little more color on the gains that you've achieved on the foundry space, where you've traditionally have had strong exposure in many of your process segments? Can you give a little bit of color where you see some of the gains?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Are you talking about in foundry, Patrick?","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In the last year, certainly PVD and epi, we talked about both of those areas being up 3%, and those are great growth drivers for us. All of the different areas around the transistor, if you look at our implant business, for instance, that business is very, very, very strong. The switching cost in the memory is much higher than in any other market. So that area, our high current share in foundry...","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","In foundry?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Our high current share in foundry is in the 90% range.","So that area is extremely strong.","Last quarter we said that our etch business had the highest revenue in foundry since 2007, so we are making some progress there. We are making more significant progress certainly in V-NAND and the memory space, but that's an area that we think longer term is a really, really great opportunity for us. So there are a number of areas. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything on this one. There are a number of different areas, and I think as you go to the future nodes in FinFET, our TAM opportunity will increase a significant amount around transistor, interconnect, and a number of different areas.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think the three things you look at here is how big is your product footprint in foundry and how strong is it? And two and three are you getting D2R wins? So if you go look at \u2013 our foundry footprint is very strong and they're highly differentiated products. That's why it stays strong. It's a share position. In terms of gaining share, because they run so many different devices and so many different customers and they're so complex, turning D2Rs into P2Rs takes a little longer, but we've got some pretty damn good D2R positions that we've worked on the last two years, which very well could turned into P2Rs later this year.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other thing I would say, in our PDC area, we're stronger in foundry and logic, and this last quarter we had some good wins in a couple of major foundries. One of the things also, if you look at our 2015 business in PDC, it's about 60% E-Beam and 40% optical. And in E-Beam, we have very high share in the E-Beam review area with the SEMVision. And if you look at the different areas of the segments within E-Beam, CD SEM, E-Beam inspection, and defect review, those are all areas that are growing very fast. And our technology there, especially electron optics imaging capability, is really world class. So that's another area we look at as we go forward where we see a potential for growth.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, that's helpful, and maybe, Bob, a specific question for you in terms of the margin impacts on some of these new product ramps. Obviously, you mentioned that the faster than expected traction has obviously put some pressure on the near term. When do you expect to see some of those supply chain efficiencies kick in, in terms of I guess supply agreements and volume buys that will help margins improve over time?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","What we're doing, Patrick, is what's driving us down is mix, where we're gaining some share a little faster than we probably expected and the new products are starting to track in. Now what we're doing to mitigate that is get the new products up the gross margin curve faster and also to get gross margins up everywhere else across the company, and that's through material cost absorption. So the cost reduction efforts across the whole company in terms of PPV are picking up reasonably, not heroically yet. We're getting better. In terms of the new products, it's picking up faster. So my guess is you'll start to see \u2013 you're seeing progress now. It will pick up more next year. What's killing us in the first half of next year is mix again.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question, first a clarification. Did I hear correctly that earlier, Bob, you said you expected 2016 WFE market to be $33.5 billion, or are you just referring to your operating models that you talked to in the past?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We don't have an official forecast. That's our model. We don't have any detailed analysis of that. If you ask and take me out for a beer, it's a working model that's okay to work with, but we don't have a real number yet.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. My first question then is, on the DRAM side, obviously very strong bookings in the first two quarters and record level last quarter. And you've talked about the second half DRAM revenue will be lower than the first half. I know you're not giving 2016 guidance yet, but are there any reasons why this strength will not continue in 2016 given the increased complexity and multiple patterning steps used in advanced nodes?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","In terms of DRAM, you said?","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Correct.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll tell you my guess. I don't know if you've got it here, but I'll tell you my guess. I think the V-NAND thing is going to pick up momentum because I think you're going to see more and more go to 3D. Patterning doesn't play there. So in fact, if you look at the mix of etch and deposition, it plays particularly well for us. If you go to DRAM, patterning does play an increasing role there. I agree with that. Now if you look at DRAM, prices are down a little bit, so they're very driven by economics in that business. So the cost is getting a little higher to make those devices, so the patterning is positive for them, but the cost is an issue in the pricing. So I think that DRAM capacity adds will be moderate.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And my follow-up question is, now that the deal is over and the reason being future product roadmap, can you talk about what areas within etch and deposition that you are not currently strong in but you are expecting to gain share in the future?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The DOJ certainly was confident, I'll tell you that.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think as we've talked about last year, we had just tremendous momentum in etch and CVD with 50% revenue growth, and we really are optimistic about the momentum we have in both of those different areas. And so we continue to believe that the opportunity for us for share gains and growing those businesses is very good.","Another area that we see as a great opportunity is ALD. We've been investing in new technology there. And we believe that that has potential for significant future growth. We have very strong pull from customers for this new technology that we've developed, but we're not in a position really to give any more color at this time. But that's certainly another area on top of the momentum that we have in etch and CVD where we see a great opportunity.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller from CLSA. Your line is open.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Gary, I didn't quite catch it. But the display mix in I guess fiscal 2016, did you say if that's LCD or OLED related?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The 2016 mix is \u2013 I'll start at the higher level. Most of it's weighted towards smaller feature sizes. That would be the cell phones versus TVs. And when you look within it, most of those are all OLED, and it's particularly LTPS, a lot of it.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The mix, as Bob talked about, the mobility mix versus TV is really up about \u2013 the percentage of the mobility is up about 2x if you look year to year, and then it goes back down to a more normalized mix between the two different markets for us. So that particular year, we see the mix of mobility up a significant amount, double what it was the year before, and we think the year after it will go back down to this more normalized mix that we've seen for a number of years.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, got it. And then going back to this WFE question, I remember in 2013 you gave the financial model before the TEL deal was announced, talking about WFE may be as high as $37 billion. I know you're not giving an official forecast for next year. But is there something that's tempering how high WFE can go in a given year? Has something changed there?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll give you my observations. When we put the model out in July 2013, one of the biggest reasons for that number was that was Dataquest's number basically at that time. We didn't know 2017 \u2013 2016 rather. And then we put up three numbers at that time, $30 billion, $33.5 billion and $37 billion. And a fair amount of our focus was on the $33.5 billion. In terms of what next year will be, we really haven't spent much time. I think it's a pretty healthy year. Could be north of that. I honestly don't know. I don't even know what Dataquest says. Do we know what Dataquest says for next year? It's up a little more than that. I think Dataquest is maybe $34 billion or something.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think certainly what we can see relative to our business, if you look at what's going to happen over the next two or three years, this transition in 3D NAND, as we said, by the end of this year you only have 10% of the capacity with 3D NAND. So that transition is really a good one for us, and the 10-nanometer transition we believe is a great opportunity. So those are going to be some of the major drivers for us over the next two or three years. And then we try to size the business relative to a normal run rate on WFE. And certainly there could be drivers to make it higher than that. But from a planning standpoint, we're sizing it around the $33 billion to $33.5 billion level.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, thank you. I just want to \u2013 I have a follow-up question on 3D NAND. Right now you have a couple of customers adding capacity for production and the use are probably not at the highest level. And they're working \u2013 different customers are working on different structures. My question is at the maturity on 3D NAND, 48-layer TLC, what bit density do you get on the wafer compared to planar? Are they closer to getting three-to-one, or are they far behind that?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll do it from memory. I don't have this in front of me, Mahesh. Our take on it was the initial transition from planar to 3D, they got traditional type of bit growth that they get in a planar shrink. They get the bigger capital efficiency and bit growth going from first generation to second generation 3D. Now what we used to run in models was a lot of 32-bit to 64-bit. So 32-bit to 64-bit, you get over 100% because you get the scaling and also the size. I don't even know if it shrinks at 40-nanometer \u2013 50-nanometer stuff. So I think the big opportunity for them is 64-bit. 48-bit is a midway I'd say. So I'd say it's moderate. It's better than first generation, not as good as 64-bit.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then on your WFE number, I suppose the last quarter you had a little bit higher number than now, and of course a lot of changes has happened since last quarter. Can you articulate what you have seen changes in segment-wise from last quarter to this quarter in terms of DRAM flash and logic and foundry?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We haven't actually changed a lot. We were about a $33.5 billion last quarter. Kind of about $33 billion now. Some of that's just FX as you run it through the euro on WFE. The euro doesn't affect us much, but euro and yen. So then the second thing is there have been some announcements like TSMC seems a little less. But I'm actually feel like maybe NAND is a little stronger later in the year. So net-net, I'm neutral on the year.","In terms of how we feel specifically by space, we're a little higher on DRAM now than we were last quarter, a little higher on NAND than we were last quarter. We're a little lower on foundry, and logic probably a little negative too from last quarter.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next questions comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Good afternoon. So as it pertains to growth, you talked a lot today about 3D NAND and you talked about the 10-nanometer transition. What about DRAM? Is DRAM in your mind a growth market for you in the next couple years?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, I think so. I mean I think so. I think that if you'll look at it, what's driving it: number one, wafer starts; number two, capital intensity; number three, our position there. So if you go look at 2015, we think overall spending is up, I don't know, 15% or something like that, 15% to 25%. And if you look at our position there, it's been improving. We gained share in DRAM in the last year or two, and we think that will continue this year.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Go ahead, Gary.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think DRAM, mobile DRAM especially has been driving incremental investment, and we're happy that our share of that market is increasing. And so that is a positive driver. But you don't have the same...","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Inflections.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yes.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...inflections in the DRAM business going forward that you have in 3D NAND and you have certainly in the FinFET technologies. The 3D NAND, the litho CapEx is declining, and the areas that we're participating in are going up a significant amount. And so we have an opportunity there with not only the CapEx increase, but more of the CapEx being spent on our area of the market, a significant change from what was there in the planar technology node. And the same thing is true on the FinFET technology. Again, that really leverages our materials engineering, some of our strongest products, as those technologies inflections are happening. So the DRAM opportunity is a good one for us, but it's not the same order of magnitude driver for us as the transition to 3D NAND and FinFET. And that's my feeling.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I agree with you. Most of what they're doing this year is conversions versus capacity adds.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the display side, is the move of OLED to TVs, is that the sweet spot for you going forward, or do you think margins might be an issue at that point as well?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We think that OLED is more focused on mobile right now, the smaller screens for mobility types of applications, not so much on TVs.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's pretty expensive for TVs.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","I was thinking out the next couple of years when it does ultimately move to TVs if that is more of the sweet spot for you versus next year.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's no question. OLED in general, we've said, if you look at it more as silicon compared to OLED, our TAM grows about 2x. So certainly as OLED is adopted, both in mobility and in the future in the TV market, that is a really great transition for us. And you really can see it also in the thin film encapsulation. We talked about the incremental opportunity there, but there are more deposition steps as you go to OLED technology. So the adoption in any of these different markets for us is a really good driver.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tom. And, Kyle, we have time for just one more question, please.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham. Your line is open.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. So first question in terms of just directionally maybe in the second half of the year versus first half, how do you see your booking trending between the DRAM\/foundry and logic buckets?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We think foundry is up in the second half. We think \u2013 do you have bookings?","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Yes.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Foundry is up. DRAM is down a little bit. NAND is up. Logic is flat.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful, and then I guess a question on PDC. So we saw some of the data from Gartner they published around market share, and it seems like PDC may be down a little bit last year. Can you maybe help us with that a little bit? Is it due to mix? How do you guys see your position? And I think you talked about 10-nanometer being an opportunity and obviously it's much higher process control intensity. How do you think you're positioned there? Do you think that could drive some incremental growth there potentially starting in 2016?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again, relative to the intensity of the percent WFE, PDC \u2013 this area has not been a great driver over the last couple years. And relative to some of the other inflections that we're focused on, we don't see this as being as large an inflection in our markets as some of the other areas. But as I talked about earlier, our business is really, if we look at 2015, more heavily weighted towards E-Beam segments, where we have a lot of strength, really great technologies. That segment of the market is growing fast and we really see a great opportunity for us to leverage that strength in growing that part of the market.","In the optical inspection area last year, certainly the mix of customers worked against us, but we recently had a really strong quarter relative to orders from a couple of large foundries. And we look at our technology position there as incrementally better than where we were at before. So we're optimistic overall PDC growth in 2015 will be good for us, and then really being positioned from a technical standpoint going forward in PDC where we think this can be a growth driver. I wouldn't say this is on the same scale as some of the other opportunities we have on the inflections and the 3D NAND and 10-nanometer FinFET. But certainly incrementally it's a positive for us, and the incremental profit from that business is also very good overall.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Great, thanks.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Edwin, for your question, and we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon.","A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time today.

Those of you joining us in New York will have the option to attend technology sessions with our general managers. The main event will be webcast live.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike and good afternoon everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we are making great progress with all the major elements of our strategy and expect to deliver record earnings in fiscal 2016. We've are focusing our investments on key customer inflections that are growing Applied Materials today in creating exciting opportunities for future growth. Our record performance is made possible by the outstanding team we have at Applied. I want to thank our employees around the world for their tremendous passion to create value for our customers and shareholders.","I'll begin today's call by summarizing our strong results and outlook in the context of our longer term strategy for sustainable, profitable growth. Then I will outline our updated view on the market environment and what this means for us. I'll conclude with a short summary of progress in each of our major businesses. After that Bob will provide additional details about our results and the improvements we're making to the company's operating performance. At Applied Materials, our strategy is to develop highly differentiated materials engineering, products and services that make technology inflections possible.","In semiconductor and display, the substantial changes in device technology that are taking place require significant materials innovation. I believe this puts Applied in a unique position. We have the broadest and deepest capabilities in materials engineering and our technology is unmatched. These advantages are helping us deliver the innovations that enable our customer success and move the industry forward. In recent years, we shifted $400 million of annual spending to improve our organizational capabilities and accelerate product development. Today, these investments are creating significant value for our customers and for Applied.","When I look at our results and outlook, there are five key drivers of our performance I'd like to highlight. First, in semiconductor, our leadership businesses are delivering key enabling technology for logic and foundry customers. These businesses have high market share and highly differentiated products and are benefiting from robust levels of foundry investment in the second half of the year. Second, our growth businesses are making significant market share gains as the 3D NAND ramp accelerates. Our combined Etch and CVD revenues for Q2 are at a 9-year high. Third, we are very well positioned in China. Domestic Chinese manufacturers are ramping up their investments and multi-national customers are expanding their footprint in the region. As a result, we are setting new records for quarterly semiconductor orders in China. The fourth driver is our sustained growth in service where we are building upon 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. And fifth, we are successfully applying our advanced materials engineering capabilities beyond semiconductor, specifically in display. New display technology such as OLED are enabled by materials innovation. This is creating significant new market opportunities for Applied.","I'll now give you our latest views on the market environment. While we're paying close attention to the global economy, at Applied, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services. This is because our semiconductor and display customers are focused on developing and ramping new technologies rather than simply building capacity. The inflection-driven investment our customers are making are highly strategic. They are battling for leadership and investing to ensure that they are ready as market demand shifts to these new technologies. In foundry, we expect investment levels for the year to be similar to 2015. We anticipate more than half of 2016 spending will be focused on the 10-nanometer node, as well as 7-nanometer pilot production.","In addition, as new projects ramp in China, we see the foundry customer mix broadening and increasing investment in trailing geometries. This is positive for Applied because we have a 30-year history of leadership in China and we've built very strong customer relationships and a great regional team there. This quarter our revenues in China are at an all-time high. In memory, we expect overall spending to be more or less flat year-on-year. However, there are important changes in the mix that play well for Applied. Investment is shifting from DRAM demand and we see DRAM down at least 25% following very high investment levels in 2015.","In contrast, we see NAND strengthening as the year progresses. Our latest adding [ph] will be 35% than 2015 as multiple customers accelerate their 3D NAND RAMs. 3D NAND is a great example of materials enabled scaling that plays directly to Applied's strengths. As I've said before, 3D NAND is all about depositing, removing and modifying materials with incredible precision. Because of this our available market at 3D NAND factory can be upto three times greater than for planer NAND. In the quarter we booked nearly $1 billion of NAND orders which is a record for us. In logic, we believe that spending levels will be very similar to last year and when we take all of these factors into consideration, we believe that 2016 wafer fab equipment investments will be similar to 2015 with some upside potential.","I will now talk about the progress we're making in each of our major businesses. In semiconductor, I'm very pleased with our strategy and how our product pipeline is shaping up. We made solid wafer fab equipment share gains in 2015, even though the spending mix was not as favorable for us as it is in 2016. Based on the positions we're winning, I expect much stronger share gains this year. Across our semiconductor businesses, I see tremendous customer pull for our latest generation products. In CMP our new LK Prime System now has over 130 units at customer sites. This product is winning market share resulting in our highest quarterly CMP orders for a decade. We are also seeing a broader adoption of Cobalt in advanced interconnect schemes and this is driving demand for our Cobalt CVD systems. This is one of the factors that it's contributing to strong share gains in CVD this year.","We continue to see rapid adoption of our SIM 3H platform launched at last year's SEMICON West. We project that we will ship around 700 chambers by the end of our fiscal year fueling strong conductor add share gains in 2016. I'm also very excited that customers are beginning to transition a number of our highly disruptive new technologies from pilot to high volume manufacturing. These include our selective removal products and Olympia ALD System. In service, we are making significant investments in our organization and capabilities so that we can deliver more value to our customers. These investments are generating a strong pipeline of new service products that help customers improve their device performance, yield and costs. We're on-track to grow this business for the third year in a row which I believe is strong evidence that our service strategy is working.","In display, I'm increasingly excited about our opportunities and the unique position we have in this market. The major technology inflections that are taking place require materials innovation so our available market is expanding significantly. One great example of this is thin film encapsulation that protects an OLED device from air and moisture. The precision deposition of this film stack is incredibly challenging, and relies on Applied advanced materials engineering capabilities. Overall, we estimate that our opportunity in OLED is more than three times larger than for traditional LCD. I believe we're still in a very early innings of OLED but we're already seeing a significant impact on our business. This quarter our orders in display were an all-time record.","To summarize, as I look ahead, I'm increasingly confident that we are in a great position to drive sustainable profitable growth at Applied Materials. Across the company, I believe we have greater opportunities and a stronger pipeline of enabling technologies than at any point in our history. We're investing more than ever to accelerate materials enabled innovations for our customers for our customers. We are maintaining a very positive outlook for 2016 because our customers aren't making inflection-driven investments as they race to introduce new technologies. These investments are both highly strategic and play directly to Applied's strengths.","Now let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our quarterly results, performance, and priorities. Bob?","Robert Halliday","Thanks, Gary. Applied Materials is extremely well positioned to deliver profitable growth this year and for the foreseeable future.","In Q2 we generated orders of $3.5 billion, the highest in 15 years. Our strength is led by silicon systems which had $2 billion in orders with nearly half demand. And by display, which had record orders of $700 million. Our backlog now stands at $4.2 billion, and is broad-based with nearly half in silicon systems, and roughly a quarter each in services and display. Our silicon systems backlog is the highest in at least 9 years.","Looking ahead, I'm confident that the investments we're making in differentiated products and services combined with our cost efficiency programs will drive record earnings. And I expect sustained performance as we help our customers drive their technology roadmaps forward, particularly in foundry, NAND and advanced displays. We have momentum in services, and we're improving our execution and operational performance across the board.","Today I'm confident that we're on-track to achieve the earnings targets in our 2018 financial model. I'll provide a detailed update at our Analyst Day in September. But with the disruptive nature of our order strength, I'd like to give you some insights during this call. We're making very good progress growing our revenues. If recent demand trends continue, which seems likely, and by 2018 I believe we can meet or exceed our targets in Silicon Systems and Services.","Through 2018 and beyond, we believe display, NAND and China will grow by more than we anticipated last year, and our positions in these growth areas are becoming stronger. I'm also confident that we will meet or exceed our goals for tax rate, weighted average share count and earnings per share. Relative to gross margins, addressed on our overall cost structure and on optimizing the gross margins within our product lines even as I display businesses strength in this year, I believe we can hold our overall gross margins flat with last year.","Over the mode of horizon, we now see faster than expected growth in urgent display. The net profitability gains from this revenue growth should be very positive for us and we're committed to achieving our operating margins targets even with the impact of this mix change on our overall gross margin percentage.","Regarding operating expenses, Gary outlined how we are gaining share in our existing markets and expanding our served addressable markets with strong customer pool. Today several of our customers are asking us to develop new technologies to support the Applied road maps and we are choosing to increase our R&D investments in certain areas this year notably in display. As we ramp up to support these new projects, we expect OpEx to increase by about $10 million sequentially in Q3 and stay at this level in Q4. At the same time we'll continue to be very aggressive in controlling and optimizing our spending to invest in sustainable revenue growth while increasing our profitability.","Let me give you some insights into how we'd optimize our operating expenses. Between 2012 and 2015, we cut spending in G&A organizations by 27%. In the same period, we boosted the funding of new and disruptive products by $400 million. We did this by using G&A savings to fund R&D and by shifting spending from underperforming areas like found [ph], to areas where we can grow and gain share by enabling major technology inflections. Today our R&D to OpEx ratio is 67% which is up over 10 points relative to 2012.","Now I'll comment on our second quarter results. Revenue of $2.5 billion was at the high end of the guidance range led by Silicon Systems. Non-GAAP gross margin of 42.7% was slightly higher than expected. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $575 million were within the range. Our non-GAAP tax rate declined to 14.4% as more profits would generate lower tax jurisdictions. We believe 15% is an achievable rate for the balance of the year. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.34 was the highest in four years, and the highest in eight years when [indiscernible].","Next I'll update you on our cash returns during the period. In Q2 we returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders. We used $900 million to repurchase over 45 million shares of our stock and paid $113 million in cash dividends. We ended the quarter with 1.1 billion shares outstanding which is the level we targeted in our 2018 model. We've now completed 95% of the $3 billion authorization we announced last April and we expect to complete the program in the current quarter. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders using dividend and buybacks and we plan to discuss the buyback program with the Board of Directors at our upcoming meeting.","Before I turn to guidance, let me share some observations and expectations surrounding our display business. Disruptive technology changes are happening in the display market that will increase customer spending this year and beyond. In the TV market, while there is sufficient overall capacity at this time, we expect additional investments in certain regions. In longer term, I believe that technologies now being piloted in mobile will be attractive in 3Ds as well. Such adoption would be very positive for us. Today customer demand for our display products is increasing, particularly in the mobile.","As a reference point, over the past three years, our display orders were $750 million per year on average. Our display orders were $883 million in the first half of this year alone. The growth we're now seeing in display comes largely from new products we've funded and developed over the past few years. Based on conversations with our customers, we expect display order strength over the rest of 2016. Most display systems are very large, and also take two to three quarters to build, deliver, install in revenue. And customers are pulling for Applied to develop new display technology that I believe will significantly expand our market opportunities over the next several years. We will invest an additional new and disruptive products to capture these opportunities. ","And while our display orders and revenues will continue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, I believe we will deliver sustainable growth overtime. We will have more to say about display opportunities at our analyst meeting in September. Now I will provide the business outlook for third quarter. We expect our overall med sales to be up by 14% to 18% sequentially. Within the revenue outlook, we outlook Silicon Systems net sales to be up by 10% to 15%. AGS net sales should be up by 5% to 8% and we expect display net Sales to be up by 70% to 90% to approximately $300 million. AES net sales should be flat to up slightly. We are modelling the non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be up by 50 to 100 basis points. ","Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $585 million plus or minus $10 million. The mid-point is up just 1.6% from the same period last year. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.50. The mid-point is up 45% from the same last year. This EPS guidance represents a new record that is significantly above any previous performance for Applied Materials.","To summarize, while overall economic and semiconducting industry conditions are relatively flat this year, Applied Materials is uniquely well positioned. We plan to set new records in a number of areas including EPS for full year. We have significantly biased our spending to disruptive new products and customer support. And I believe we now have a great pipeline of new and emerging products focused on the key technology inflections. We also have strong customer pull in markets and regions that give us sustainable opportunities to deliver profitable growth in the years ahead.","Now let me turn the call over to Mike for questions.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Toshiya Hari","Hi, thank you for taking my question and congrats on a very strong guide. My first question is on the display outside of the business. In the past you guys have talked about increasing your stand by 3x over the next couple of years. I guess my question is how much have you realized already and how much is still coming going forward? ","Robert Halliday","Sure, let me see if I can start and Gary can jump in. what we are seeing is two or three things helping us here. One, the overall market is going for spending. Two, opposition is growing. I don't think we have reached the culmination of our ability to grow and I think that's going to go on for the next several years. ","Toshiya Hari","Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up is on the core SSG side of things. In the quarter you just reported obviously NAND orders were up sequentially and I was surprised to see foundry down a little bit. On the NAND side where are you picking up share and on the foundry side is it starting to assume that orders start to pick up in the current July quarter? Thank you. ","Robert Halliday","Yes, on the NAND business very strong pull from the customers as NAND moves from Litho enabled scaling to materials labor scaling so we see very pull for edge we are gaining new steps and very strong performance. Overall we believe this will be a strong year for Etch business will gain share and certainly in 3D NAND the growth there is significant. Deposition is another area, CVD is an area that's very strong in NAND. We have additional epi-steps in NAND. There are many additional CMP steps so there are number of areas where there is significant growth for us in 3D NAND and we look at this as a wave that will continue over the next few years. So it is really a great opportunity for Applied where our TAM is going up as you are moving up from Litho to materials and we are also significantly increasing our share in 3D NAND.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open. ","C.J. Muse","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question is on the Silicon front, couple of parts, first one is you talked upon upside potential till you flagged WFEL look. I would love to hear your thoughts there and then as you think about growing Share and Etch, very favorable mix in terms of Foundry as well as China and what you are doing around 3D NAND and how should we think about your growth in calendar 2016 relative to that flat to slightly up WFEL look?","Gary Dickerson","Yes, I will try if I can jump in. we agree it's flat up this year. The year hasn't unfolded as we had hoped last November it's gone better and better for us frankly. If you look at it NAND has picked up, we now think it's up about 35% year-over-year. While DRAMs is probably down about 25%. ","Foundry is not up a lot this year, up somewhat but if you look at our position within foundry, it is really strong and then DRAM also gaining so if you go look at our position with each we are gaining share. I will give you a fact you may not have picked up on. Pre-2012 we were only over 15% in one of the four major groups when you look at NAND, DRAM, foundry and logic. This year we project to be over 20% so if you look at the NAND spending at $9.2 billion, our share is going up to probably under 15% to north of 20% this year and he spending is up to $9.2 billion whereas in the base shift 2012 was about $4.2 billion. ","So the market is up and our share is up significantly. And the NAND strength goes on for a number of years as you know by the end of this year we are only going to have about $375,000 wafer stacks converted. There is another a million wafer stacks out there playing on. If you go look at foundry, we anticipate being a reasonable year in foundry, but our positions done really well. Whether it's in Taiwan or lot of the activity going on in China. So we are gaining, we are doing very strongly.","And then also logic we are doing well, leading into logic so the way the years laid out our positioning of our products in the market is at fastest growing whether it is NAND, strength in leading edge in foundry, strength in China and also strength in display is playing very well for Applied. So we expect within same gain shares.","Robert Halliday","Thank you, I will take the Etch question. So as I said earlier, we think that 2016 is going to be a really strong year for us in growing our Etch share. We have a very strong position, very strong position in 3D NAND conductor edge. So, as that business continues to grow, as that wave moves forward over the next few years, we are in a really great position and we have some of the most exciting products in this group that I have seen in my whole career. The same three, tremendous poll from customers in 3D NAND and also in other segments, we are winning new steps and really across the board for same three so very strong position there and also in selected material removal. We have very strong focus from customers and that business is also growing for us at a strong rate. So overall, we think 2016 is going to be a great year for Etch and again some of the strongest products I have seen in my career. ","C.J. Muse","That's very helpful, thank you. Sneak one quick one on OLED in. I thought your commentary on the TV set was interesting. When do you think you will start to see your first Gen 8 plus orders for OLED?","Gary Dickerson","Right now what's driving the market in 2016 as we said earlier in the year, we sad earlier over 60% in our orders in revenues this year were going to be Mobile versus TV, in fact that's probably turned up to now over 70 now in terms of order rate. If you look at the big inflection that's taking around mobile and OLED, that inflection may come sometime in TVs but it's not unforeseeable to me in the future. ","C.J. Muse","That's very helpful, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen Chin","Thanks. Hi Gary, Bob, congrats on the execution. Question Bob on the comment that there may be display orders strength for the rest of 2016. Is the display visibility from a follow on order to a big Korean customer or do you have visibility from other display customers, perhaps in China who are constructing a lot of new display fab? It just sounds like the message is AMAT's total orders could be strong in the second half of the year. Just trying to get some color on that, thanks.","Robert Halliday","Well I think as Gary sort of referred to the waves, things that are happening for us now are not one quarter advanced, there is several inflections going on. In display it's around OLED, in NAND it's around V-NAND even in the China thing this has been going on for years and in the foundry strength we have seen on severance going to go on next couple of years. So these big inflections are going to go on for a number of years. For instance, in display we think it's going to go on for a while, it's not a one quarter event and we see the concentration in mobile in terms of your specific question on TVs I guess in China, was that the specific question? Yes, we think the display order rate will be fixed around for this year. ","Stephen Chin","Okay, thanks Bob. Just a follow-up question on the foundry orders. Just to clarify do you think second half foundry orders because foundry orders are up in the second half, it is possible aim at total orders remain quite strong in the second half of the year too?","Robert Halliday","We think in our fiscal year, we think our orders in foundry remain quite strong. We think in the calendar year, split for the business we think foundry has second half weighted also. So we think second half is pretty good on foundry.","Stephen Chin","Okay. Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot, I have two. I guess I am just looking at the upside to the orders and it really seems like it was driven from purely OLED and it looks like China memory stuff, so it seems like you are finally beginning to see these China memory projects move within your 12 month shipment window. So I guess my question really is how much can China add to WSE say next year because if you book like an income of $400 million to $500 million this quarter from those projects, that would argue that you could add maybe couple of billion to WSE next year. So I am wondering if that math works with you.","Robert Halliday","Yes, let me give you, you said have two questions. Let me strike them both. First in terms of the second quarter just ended we were pretty strong across the board in orders. We had a very strong quarter, almost a billion dollars as Gary mentioned. And in terms of the other devices foundry, D-RAM and logic we were reasonably strong actually across the board and display was very strong and services did well too. So our strength was pretty broad in terms of the China impact, the Chinese talk about spending $20 billion to $30 billion of over 4 to 5 years. We are seeing record revenue for ourselves in China this period and it's gone up and our expectations have gone up every quarter basically so in terms of they spend $20 billion to $30 billion over 4 to 5 years. ","How much is incremental? That's about $4 billion a year roughly, $5 billion a year. I would say for the next three years you could see some maybe half of it incremental. I think it provides an underpinning for overall demand so that you feel pretty comfortable that next year is probably a good 32 year if you guess because you got this underpinning of good NAND, good China, I think the second wave of 10-7 is okay. D-RAM I am not sure about. ","Gary Dickerson","Yes, one other thing I would say is China is probably our strongest region relative to our position with both the domestic companies and multi-national companies and as Bob said the momentum just keeps building. We have doubled revenue in china over the last 2 years and I am spending a fair amount of time there myself and certainly you look at what's happening there now and discussions for future projects. As Bob said, multi-year wave opportunity in terms of China. Hard to say exactly what the number would be but it is definitely going to be up a fair amount. ","Timothy Arcuri","Got it. Thank for that and then I guess follow-up is I know previously you guys talked about 3D-NAND installed target of 350,000 and 400,000 industry-wide actually this year, so it seemed like maybe the industry was going to add roughly 200,000 this year. So my question is how much of that is conversion versus how much of that is Greenfield? Thanks.","Robert Halliday","Sure. This year we came in to the year with 150,000 installed. We think the year goes up to 350,000 to 400,000. In terms of the mix we think ads, capacity ads probably a 100 to 150 converts to 100 to 150 in a year. ","Timothy Arcuri","Great, thanks so much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmed from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Farhan Ahmed","Hi guys, congrats on the great quarter. One question on your spending pattern on NAND. Do you still think it's a first half dated this year or do you think it will go away in second half and the incremental strength in the NAND is stronger in the, is it more in the second half you are seeing the uptake or was it already captured in the bookings in your first half?","Gary Dickerson","Yes, in terms of the NAND split the first half is stronger for the NAND but the second half is pretty good so we think it's more first half weight but does fall for second half, pretty good. What was your second question?","Farhan Ahmed","Just the global uptake you are seeing in NAND, you mentioned the NAND spending is now, you expect it to be stronger than your last quarter call and I just wanted to understand is I take more in the first half or the second half?","Gary Dickerson","Yes we are up to $9.2 billion on NAND right now and I think last quarter we brought half a billion less may be. We are seeing broad based spending, some stuff was pulled into the first half and second half is staying strong. ","Farhan Ahmed","Got it. And then regarding China like obviously it's the strongest region this quarter but even going back it seems like it's tracking to the second strongest region for you guys for a while. I just wanted to understand in terms of your exposure to China how much of that this quarter was display versus semi-conductors, if you can provide some color on that it would be really helpful?","Gary Dickerson","Yes, we were particularly strong in semi-conductor this quarter in China. We see despite has been very strong but right now the TVs in China the order rates are not as high as it was. ","Farhan Ahmed","Got it, that's all I have. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. First, Gary and Bob in terms of the foundry orders and outlook that you have, have you started seeing any pick up in 10 nanometers or are you still seeing like the first quarter, some of the orders coming in from the 28 nanometer nodes?","Gary Dickerson","Yes, we are going to have a strong 10 year and then going to have some 7 also. In terms of the split we think you came into the year with 10 & 7 at about 10,000. We think you would go out of the year maybe 60, some may add 50 concentrated in Taiwan and then if you look at it, what's unusual about this Patrick is some of the trailing edge stuff is pretty strong. You see fair amount of over 40 and above and you see pretty good 28 year also and a lot of that is Chinese impact. ","Patrick Ho","Great. And your shareholder return you mentioned that you are completing your shareholder stock buyback this current quarter. Can you just give perhaps a little bit of update of what do you think you will do on a going forward basis?","Gary Dickerson","Yes, we are going to talk about this at the Board of Directors meeting. Share is obvious. We are very committed to shareholders returns, cash returns in fact in the last year we have returned 250% of free cash flow so we can't stay at that level. We are already committed and we also said in the call we will beat our targets of weighted average share in the model in 2018 so you know we are almost there now so we will continue to get better on that. In terms of the magnitude of the debt we have to talk to the board but we are committed to the shareholder returns. We are committed to beating away average shares in the model and the details of it will have to go through with the board in June.","Patrick Ho","Right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you and congratulations on the success here. Bob you have kind of given us in bits or pieces but obviously just hoping you could overall give us a sense of how you are thinking about second half calendar revenues over the first half on one hand with the strong July guide you have got, arguably a tough comp. On the other hand, I did notice that your revenue growth guidance for July is well below your growth in your backlog which kind of implies that sales should be strong for the balance of the year. So just how are you thinking about second half calendar year versus first half overall?","Robert Halliday","Well, a piece together data you already have just to give you some more pieces to the puzzle. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $4.2 billion and we said in -- if we're going to stay [ph] right now in 73% of the backlog is shippable in the next six months. And then if you look at it on the semi side, the lead times and that stuff typically not so long, on display we've said that the lead times historically been six to nine months, now we're able to increase our outlook for display revenues next quarter because we're trying to pump a little bit in the supply chain, so we're optimistic that display can continue strong in revenues for the rest of the calendar year. So we are feeling pretty good that our second half will be up from first half and it will be well in the year.","And the underpinnings that we talked about our strength and display where we have the orders in backlog and figured that strong, in semi it was till we think that share gains goes up this year and as this in semi equipment, and services will get strong for the rest of the year, it will continue to be strong. And -- so we feel pretty good about the second half.","Romit Shah","Great. And then just on display, as the revenues improve how do we think about incremental margins on this business, I think it's averaged about 20% but we know that it does bounce around.","Robert Halliday","Yes, we think the operating margins prospectively for display are pretty positive. Right now we're ramping a lot of things, we're ramping new products, we're ramping production. So we think over the time as we basically said or implied in the financial of the company, the display operating margins for the company will be similar to the overall average for the company. Now both display and AGS have slightly different business model in FSG and that the gross margin tend to be little higher in FSG but the operating expenses metrics are less in AGS and display. So your net-net come down about the same operating margins.","Romit Shah","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar","Hi, thanks for taking my question, I have two of them. First one either Bob or Gary, out of the $700 million in display orders, how much of them was for OLED specifically? And would most of these be revenues in fiscal '17. Can you give some color on that and then I had a follow-up.","Robert Halliday","Sure. What we said earlier in the year that of our display business this year, over 60% was going to be mobile and in fact it's probably over 70% now and the vast significant majority of that -- the great majority of that is focused on the OLED market this year in terms of the order rate. In terms of when it revenues, we anticipate as we guided that our revenues will be up next quarter, we are positive out of revenue opportunities for Q4 and we think we'll do very well in display next year too, there won't all obviously revenue in next six months -- three to six months but we feel good about our opportunity on a long-term basis in display.","Krish Sankar","Got it. And then as a follow-up question for Gary, you guys are getting some traction in Etch, especially on the 3D NAND side. Can your current Etch tools actually do 96 or 128-layer 3D NAND or do you need to develop new tools? I'm just trying to figure out the R&D profile on Etch or FSG like two years down the road.","Gary Dickerson","Sure. So let me first also add to Bob's comments on display and then I'll get to Etch. So I really think it's important for people to understand where are the early innings of this opportunity in terms of the OLED wave. And relevant to the questions on sustainability, if you look at the waves that are really driving our business in display, NAND, China; we're in the really innings of all of those different ways. We are continuing to invest and we've expanded our TAM by a factor of 3, we have an opportunity to expand our TAM more in the future. So that went out really, very optimistic that we're going to continue to drive significant growth in display going forward.","And then in Etch, we're in a very strong position in Etch to gain share in 2016 and beyond. As I said before, the products that we have; SIM3, selective material removal products, it's almost on a weekly basis I hear new opportunities, very strong poll across the board all customers for these new technologies and so relative to 96-pairs or over 100-pairs we have poll from customers in some of the most critical applications were PTOR\/DTOR in some of the most critical applications. So I'm extremely optimistic that we're going to continue to gain share in Etch in 2016 and beyond.","Krish Sankar","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joseph Moore","Great, thank you. I'm wondering if you can give us R&D as a kind of puts and takes on gross margin in the back half. I would think that the ramp will display in 3D and Etch in the make shift towards memory, all will be sort of headwinds in gross margin, just -- anyway we should think about that?","Robert Halliday","Sure, that's a good question. We are working a lot on gross margins. Let me give you -- year-end analysis you might find interesting. So the company gross margins as you know were 40.9 in 2012, 42.1 in 2013, 44.1 in 2014, and then we went down a little bit around 43 last year, I think it would be probably about the same next year. I guess we're 42 last year. And so I feel when we're making a traction or not, so I have the guys run all of our BUs and all of our segment with current gross margins by BU segment with 14 mix. And if you take the 14 mix, when we are in 44.1, the gross margins this year would be 44.7 which is up six times from NAND and north of our committed model 44.6.","So what you see is within virtually all the product groups, and within -- exercise the cost reduction and negotiation, we're doing pretty well actually, and it is in fact mix the challenge for us. So I do think that as I said earlier, for instance display is a similar operating margins to company but lower gross margins. In Etch we're doing great in terms of growing profitability and market share, it was all lower gross margin also at this stage. So those are headwinds in our phase this year but we think we'll offset them and still hit the roughly 43% on the end as we said earlier in the year.","Joseph Moore","Okay. And can you give us some idea how much different the display gross margins maybe just qualitatively and does that change when you're sort of three times on NAND that you've been?","Robert Halliday","Yes, we haven't gone into that level of detail. We think overtime that gross and operating margins in display will trend up but we haven't been specific on the numbers.","Joseph Moore","Okay. Thank you very much. Great quarter.","Robert Halliday","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Hey guys, good job on the quarterly execution on the strong guide. Getting the personal environment in DRAM, there seems to be more pressure on your DRAM customers to move to the 1X nanometer node. So I guess question here is, are you starting to see of the early spending for 1X in your second half pipeline? And how do you see DRAM spend second half versus first half?","Robert Halliday","I'll start and Gary can jump in if he wants. We think DRAM was front-end loaded, first half loaded on a calendar year, softer in the second half. In terms of our outlook for DRAM specifically, we think it's stronger in the first half than second half. We have speculation about some of that early spend in DRAM but it's not in our line of sight yet.","Harlan Sur","Got it, thanks for those insights. And then on OLED, the team obviously has been talking about $3 to $4 opportunity versus the more from silicon, you've also on this call have been talking about some new tools that couldn't even drive further increase in your OLED term opportunity, thin film encapsulation was a good example of that. So I guess the question here is, are you guys already sampling some of these new tools? And when should we hear about formal introduction of these tools and when could they start to add to your revenue streams?","Gary Dickerson","Thanks for the question. So you mentioned thin film encapsulation, and certainly that's a great example, materials engineering enabling new capabilities for our customers and also growth for Applied. So as you said, we talked about that being a great opportunity and that part of what we're seeing in terms of very, very strong opportunity in display. We do have other areas that we're working on but we're not really ready to forecast or signal when those technologies will be ready but I would say that that team in display is an incredible team of people, they've demonstrated that they can grow in these major inflections and I'm very optimistic that this way that we're seeing in display OLED is a multi-year wave and then I really believe that we have a great opportunity to not only ride that wave but expand our TAM and share in display. So very, very optimistic about that business.","Robert Halliday","I'll just add, the team's done a great job, number one. Number two, the market is going to grow for a while and are going to capture with products we're still pushing down the pipe and look very optimistic it's going to grow. So self-addressable market looks good too.","Harlan Sur","Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Athis Mallick [ph] from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks for taking my question and good job on the quarter. If I look at your foundry orders were -- the last six quarters have declined on a year-over-year basis and I'm just trying to reconcile that with your expectations of second half being better for foundry and given the few sentence you said on the call that 10-nanometer could be a shorter demand node as customers are keeping out more products for the 7-nanometer. So I just want to understand the risk in the second half foundry expectations, is it more China weighted or more Tier-1 foundry weighted? And then I have a follow-up.","Robert Halliday","You've got three questions; and the annual trend going back a few years half of this projections in the next year. So if you look at the trend maybe you're correct that total foundry spending from 2014 was down to 2015, down -- sort of flat, up a little bit in 2016. I don't have 2013 in front of me, I think it was similar to -- here is 2013, not too much total though [ph], there it is -- 2013 was about the same. So 2013 and 2014 was about the same, down a little bit 2015, down a little bit 2016. So that's the annual trend. If you look at the year, we're pretty confident that foundry is strong in the second half based on the timing of the specific summit.","Now what you have going along which is a little different than a lot of people were concerned about sort of the dynamic of what happened in 2014 going to 2015 and what could happen in 2016 going into 2017. So if you don't look at 2014, when we turn down to 2015, this sort of had a latent excess capacity, right. You had 28-nanometer business have been purchased a year or two before capacity for big foundry manufacturer. And then a lot of the capacity was added very aggressively in 2014, so 20-nanometer for the same found-customer. So that you had latent potential capacity there that hit us in 2015. And that also hit us a little bit with another foundry customers who thought they could get some of the business.","You don't have the same type of dynamic this year because you're in the very early stages of the buildup, 10-7 to the overbuild you had from the previous note, say 28 in this case, you don't really have that as much from 2014-2016. And thirdly, they haven't ramped that much on at this point. In 2014, at the end of 2014 they had about 100,000 wafer starts total installed of 20, then in this year on PAN alone, they might have 50,000. So that would 55,000 or 60,000.","So you're in the early stages; so one, it's been trending down over years, primary because of there is capacity issue there and growth is little bit down. Second, is the second half good this year, yes it is, because we can see it. Third, do we have this big capacity issue next year? Not so much because it's different and related to that, an unusually high amount of spending in foundry this year is at 40 and above and 28 is pretty strong because of the China problem. So I think catching all on the foundry, sort of a floor is the China problem with adding to foundry floor.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, and I have a follow-up. Is your ability to ship revenue display if it being constrained by other display makers ability to capacity ramp? For example, we've heard some of application tools might not be able to ramp capacity as quickly as the market is demanding?","Robert Halliday","I've said right now, it's dependent on that.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Pacific Crest. Your line is open.","Weston Twigg","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you could help us understand the 3D NAND customers migrated from adding some Greenfield capacity this year to more planar NAND conversions. Can you give us an idea of what you're revenue opportunity is, maybe per 10,000 wafer starts of Greenfield 3D NAND versus planer conversion 3D NAND capacity?","Gary Dickerson","Sure, so this is confusing as hell and I am going to try make it half a confusing as hell. So, I am going to give you really simple numbers first. In 2012 total NAND spending was $4.2 billion. We think total NAND spending is just $9.2 billion. Applied Materials share that spending in 2012 was a little under 15%. Applied Materials share that spending over 20% this year. So our revenues are going to go from about $600 million a NAND to close to $2 billion for its share. So the market has more doubled but our revenues have more than tripled because our share is up 50%. Next observation, I will give you is if you compare Greenfield to Greenfield, I am happy to do that for you. A $100,000 wafer stock last planar Greenfield is $3.5 billion. A 3D Greenfield 48 per is $5 billion. But what you kind of have to model is what would they actually buying? ","So in 2012 there was a mix of ads and converts right and so if you go look at the data, it's actually fair amount of adds oddly enough in 2012 but for us as a company we mostly were getting the shrink money. Mostly that money was more weighted on converts for Litho so do you go look at it and you go to a 50-50 model now roughly between converts from planar in 3D, our revenue opportunity for where we were in the three days is up more than 3x. And the simple math of what's going on was is 3x yields, it should be even more because the total spending is up. It will be more but there is unusually high spending on planar adds in 2012 so our revenue opportunity apples to apples was kind of over 3x. ","Weston Twigg","All right, I think I got all that. And the other piece of the question or the follow-up question is how much 3D-NAND capacity industry can realistically absorb each year. I would flooding the market with 3D NAND since you get more bits on a wafer. ","Robert Halliday","Well, what's going to happen is I believe and I think many people believe that is 3D NAND matures and becomes even more reliable and reduces its cost point particularly going to 48 an 64-layers, it's going to significantly expand its market so you kind of grow these drives. So right now we have, I think we had 1,394,000 wafers found in the world of man and through the end of last year 150,000 converted to about 375,000, I think the vast majority of it is converted over time because they are not going to be able to sell that 2D device very well and it's not going to be competitive. ","One other thing I will add on 3D NAND overall, our position in 3D NAND is better than any other company. If you look at our strength in Etch the share gains will become evident this year very strong. We are number one in deposition. We have additional CMP staffs, Epi staffs. So again, if you look at our opportunity in 3D NAND. Really we are in a unique position so as those Greenfield factories ramp or the conversion happens. If you look at the spending profile, the spending profile is completely different than it was at 2D NAND. ","Gary Dickerson","Funny thing you wouldn't intuitively say is that in 2D our market share of conversions was less than our market share of adds. Because they are mostly litho tools. If you go to V-NAND our market share is high in adds but even higher in converts because they don't have to buy new [ph], okay. So they will convert model the total comes down but our share is pretty good actually.","Weston Twigg","All right, makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jerome [ph] from BNP Paribas. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you for taking my question. Could you just give us a little bit color on your\u2026","Robert Halliday","Yes, we have a very strong momentum with ALD and we are pretty much on track with what we have previously communicated. Very strong position and leading logic and foundry customers. They are seeing device advantages as they are going to the most advanced technology nodes so we look at this as a very good opportunities. One of the areas that will fuel our share gains in 2016.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, great. Jerome, thanks for your question.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you, Tiya, and good afternoon. Joining me today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; Gary Dickerson, our Company\u2019s President; and George Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.","Today we\u2019ll discuss the results for our first quarter ended January 27. You can find a copy of our earnings release on our website, appliedmaterials.com. We will also find our quarterly financial highlights presentation, which provides additional details.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to share a calendar announcement. Applied plans to hold its next Investor and Analyst meeting on Monday, July 8 in Santa Clara, California. We hope to see many of you here at our headquarters for the event.","And now, let me turn the call over to Mike Splinter.","Michael R. Splinter","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Applied\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2013 largely played out as we had expected. Thanks to solid execution and disciplined management of discretionary spending, we delivered $0.06 of non-GAAP earnings per share, which represented the high-end of our outlook.","Overall, I\u2019m pleased with how we navigated the bottom of this industry investment cycle and with our semiconductor orders up over 80% in the first quarter, we\u2019re more optimistic about the potential of our markets this year.","Implementation of the restructuring plan, we outlined in the fall was progressing well. The actions we are taking include permanent shifts in the costs basis of the company, as well as the substantial reduction in our solar investments. By re-prioritizing our spending, we are able to strengthen customer facing technical resource and accelerate product development programs. This supports our strategic priorities to expand our share in wafer fab equipment and drive profitable long-term growth in display and solar. Now, let me provide an overview of our markets.","Global demand for mobile products remain strong, and we expect year-on-year growth of around 35% for smartphones and 55% for tablets. Growth at this level will support solid investment by the foundries and we believe these customers will represent around 45% of wafer fab equipment spending in 2013.","Mobile devices are also driving demand for NAND flash memory. However, some of the growth in this market is being suppressed by lower end smartphone and tablet models that are specifically tailored for emerging markets and equipped with less onboard memory.","Overall, NAND is growing and we believe that this growth rates will be in the range of 50% for 2013, which is sufficient to support investment in new capacity by the second half of the year. Our development teams are working closely with customers on 3D NAND technology, and when this inflection occurs, it will drive an additional investment cycle by memory manufacturers.","The DC market looks to be relatively flat this year as touch-enabled hybrid models verve the lines between traditional laptops and tablets, there is a potential upside to this scenario. For the time being, we remain cautious about logic investment expecting to see a modest increase in spending relative to 2012, primarily due to the timing of factory build outs.","DRAM prices are starting to rise, however, we still anticipate DRAM investment remaining at low levels. We are spending limited to technology conversions. In recent weeks, there have been some positive announcements from our largest customers. As a result, we now believe the 2013 wafer fab equipment will be flat to down 10% relative to 2012 spending of around $30 billion. In order to reach the high end of the range, we\u2019ll need to see investment from a broader base of logic and foundry customers in the second half of the year as well as an up tick in land investment.","We believe that we can now grow wafer fab equipment in 2013 with share gains driven by strong demand for our transistor products, combined with application wins and inspection and a customer spending mix that\u2019s favorable to applied materials.","In display, there is sense of renewed excitement in the TV market with 60 inch and larger models reaching attractive price points, and the introduction of new 4-K resolution. Following a two-year of capacity digestion, we expect investment in new display factories to resume in the second half of the year. Customers are still cautious and the timing of their factory builds will largely depend on their confidence in the macroenvironment. Orders for equipment to manufacturer touch panels and high performance mobile screens remain healthy and production is moving to larger substrate sizes, particularly Gen 6.","In solar, end markets continue to grow at between 10% and 20% annually and it looks like overall 2012 installations ended the year at around 31 gigawatts. However, conditions within the supply chain remain extremely challenging with consolidation and rationalization of manufacturing capacity, happening more slowly than we had anticipated. Our approach in solar is to be prudent. We are taking additional steps to scale back our investment until there are clear indications that the market conditions are improving.","Before I hand the call over to Gary, I would like to take this opportunity to wish George every success in his new role at Qualcomm and thank him on behalf of every one at Applied for all the contributions he had made to our company during the past 13 years. We are in the process of selecting a successor from a strong pool of internal and external candidates and we expect to appoint a new CFO in the coming weeks.","Now, let me hand the call over to Gary for additional comments about our business and strategic priorities. Gary?","Gary E. Dickerson","Thanks, Mike. I would also like to wish George well in his new position at Qualcomm and thank him for everything he has done to help get Applied to the position of financial strength that we enjoy today.","As Mike outlined, the expected levels of capital investments by our semiconductor and display customers provide a solid foundation for the year ahead. Also, major trends within these markets create great opportunities for Applied to extend our leadership in precision materials engineering and grow faster than the markets themselves.","The most important component of our strategy for profitable growth is to increase our share of wafer fab equipment. In Q1, we built momentum for market share gains by winning several new development tool of record positions at the 20-nanometer node and converted a number of existing positions into volume orders.","Demand for better mobile products is driving innovation and we are seeing major inflections in device technology and the introduction of many new materials as customers strive to differentiate themselves with extended battery life, low power, and higher performance products. These inflections are enabled by precision, materials engineering applications, including precision films, material removal, material modification and interface engineering. This is where Applied has clear technology and market leadership, and will be a major factor in driving our growth in wafer fab equipment shares.","Over the past three months, we\u2019ve been implementing import organizational changes to strengthen our teams and redeploy funding to accelerate our highest impact growth programs. We have restructured at workforce, we have scaled back our investment in solar, and we\u2019ve carried out an extensive review of our R&D portfolio, stopping programs, where we believe we didn\u2019t have valuable, sustainable differentiation, and increasing funding for programs where we do.","As a result, we are shifting approximately $200 million to key strategic priorities that drive profitable growth. Our strategy is to focus on allocating the appropriate level of investments to market segments where we believe we can achieve a leadership position. This means ramping investment in some areas, while reducing or eliminating investments in others.","On an ongoing basis, we will look at every aspect of our business through the length of profitable growth and prioritize every dollar toward our best opportunities. One area where we are investing is in field technical resources to upgrade the interfaces between customers, and our R&D teams. By strengthening our field technical teams, we will build stronger customer relationships and ensure we are the company, our customers seek out first to solve their highest value device performance and yield challenges.","In addition, we have combined the best product development practices across the company and to-date, we have trained 35 development teams in the application. This is improving our ability to define winning products and increasing the velocity of our development process.","Let me now provide an update for each of our businesses. In semiconductor, technology inflections that enable lower leakage transistors, low resistance interconnects, and advanced patterning are expanding our markets in providing a catalyst to grow our share.","Our market leadership in the overall transistor module combined with the most significant transistor device technology changes in the last 10 years, creates a great opportunity for Applied Materials. As foundry customers add capacity for the 28-nanometer node and start to ramp 20-nanometer technology, capital intensity is rising in the areas where Applied has the best technology and is a leader. As a result, we expect the strong 2012 performance that we demonstrated in our front-end products, implant, and PVD businesses to continue in 2013.","In addition, the adoption of new epitaxy steps at advanced family technology nodes will enable us to further grow our [App] business. We achieved important milestones in our first quarter, winning development and production tool of record selections at our top three customers.","The past two years have been a challenging period for our CMP business and we lost market share in 2012 due to an unfavorable customer spending mix, significant improvements to our latest generation tool delivers a clear architectural advantage for advanced nodes and we expect to start recapturing share in 2013.","Inspection represents an attractive growth driver for Applied and I am pleased with the progress our team is making. We had very strong customer pole for our wafer inspection and review products last year and we believe foundry and logic wins for our Brightfield tools will translate into continued momentum in 2013.","In Etch, we are focusing on key technology inflections in market segments where we believe we have opportunities to deliver technology with sustainable differentiation. With recent new application wins in logic, foundry and NAND flash, we are starting to demonstrate positive momentum.","Turning to display, larger TV sizes and 4K Ultra High Definition are important trends that create opportunities for us to increase share. These trends drive larger panels and smaller pixels that increase the value of the device performance and yield advantages of our technology. As 15-inch and larger TVs become a higher percentage of the market, we anticipate more manufacturers will move to Gen 10 substrates. This transition is an important inflection that plays to Applied\u2019s advantage, and will enable us to leverage our leadership and particles and uniformity to gain market share on PVD and extend our leadership in CVD.","As we have previously announced, we have taken actions in EES to reduce our costs and restructure the organization. We continue to monitor industry conditions closely and based on our current market view, we decided to further lower our spending beyond the levels discussed in the last earnings call.","By the end of this fiscal year, our goal is to reduce EES operating expenses to a run rate below $25 million per quarter. We continue to invest what we can provide differentiated technology to enable higher sell efficiencies and lower cost per watt and remain confident that this business can deliver long-term profitable growth for Applied.","In summary, we are optimistic about our opportunities for the year ahead and we are confident that the strategy we are executing will drive profitable growth. We are focused on growing our share of wafer fab equipment and have strong momentum. We are making prudent investments in display and solar and we continue to strengthen the organization in areas that are critical to our success.","Let me now hand the call over to George for further details on our performance. George?","George S. Davis","Thank you, Gary, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. To begin, I would like to thank Mike and Gary for their good wishes and partnership. I would also like to thank Applied\u2019s employees, investors, and the analyst community for the opportunity to work with you. For more than a decade, it has been my privilege to work with some of the best and brightest minds in the industry.","and finally, I\u2019m very proud of the finance team at Applied Materials. Now, I will cover our financial results for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2013. Orders increased 44% from the prior quarter to $2.1 billion, led by strong demand for semiconductor and display equipment.","Our backlog increased 31% to $2.1 billion and our book-to-bill ratio increased to $1.3 billion. Net sales of $1.6 billion were at the high end of our outlook due to stronger than expected performance in SSG.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 39.8%, up 1.4 point sequentially despite lower revenue driven by a higher mix of SSG revenue and lower inventory reserves. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $514 million, excluding certain favorable items, our non-GAAP operating expense would have been approximately $535 million in line with our guidance.","In Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating expense to increase to $560 billion plus or minus $10 million, reflecting the absence of holiday shutdown savings of $15 million, along with increased investment in SSG partially offset by increased savings from our various cost reduction programs.","For the year, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be roughly $2.2 billion, essentially unchanged from 2012. This includes the sizable increase in growth funding for SSG enabled by operating cost improvements related to the workforce reductions announced in October, the EES restructuring and the integration of Varian.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.2% and we now expect a rate of 24% to 26% for the year, an improvement of 1 point from our previous estimates, primarily from the benefit of the R&D tax credit.","Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.06 were at the high end of the target range led by strong SSG performance and lower operating expenses. The cost today of the workforce reduction program announced in October is $110 million. We now expect the total cost to be in the range of $120 million to $160 million below the original estimate of $180 million to $230 million, the primary reasons for the change in estimates are lower relative participation levels in the voluntary retirement program and a reduced estimate of the final cost of benefits. We expect annual savings and headcount reductions to be within the ranges originally provided.","Cash from operations was approximately $16 million, reflecting lower revenue levels, severance payments related to workforce reductions and the timing of annual variable compensation payments. We expect cash from operations to trend back in line with historical performance over the remainder of the year. Cash and investments end of the quarter at $2.8 billion, a sequential decline of $177 million. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be investing an attractive opportunities in our core businesses increasing the dividend in line with the growth of the business and utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash.","Next, I will comment on our segment results as compared to final quarter. SSG orders were up 84% to $1.4 billion driven by foundry and well above our outlook about more than 25%. 74% of the orders were from three customers, reflecting the concentration of investments in Q1 and our increasing momentum at the largest customers. Net sales increased to 11% to $969 million just above the high end of our outlook with an increase in foundry partially offset by lower NAND revenue. Again, we saw a very high concentration with 75% of revenue from our top three customers.","SSG\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin grew to 18.6%. In AGS, orders were down 6% to $544 million. Net sales were down 24% to $471 million, due to the low-end of our outlook, excluding the thin film solar line recognized in the fourth quarter, net sales would have been down 12%.","The revenue decline reflected tight customer spending controls as wafer starts in overall utilization rates trended lower for the second consecutive quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin declined to 19.3%. In display, orders increased 66% to $138 million, reflecting ongoing mobility investments and the beginning of resurgence and TV equipment orders.","We continue to be optimistic for further TV and mobile equipment order strength in the second half. Net sales in the quarter were $87 million in line with our outlook with the vast majority of revenue from mobile display systems. Non-GAAP operating margin grew to 5.7% demonstrating the Group\u2019s focus on remaining profitable in a low revenue environment.","In EES, orders were $68 million primarily due to strength in our wave equipment business while solar equipment orders remain depressed due to ongoing overcapacity issues for our customers. Net sales were $46 million in line with our outlook. EES had a non-GAAP operating loss of $44 million. We are on track to reduce the quarterly run rate or non-GAAP operating expense to below $30 million by the end of Q2, a 20% reduction from Q1 levels.","Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Mike for our Q2 outlook. Mike?","Michael R. Splinter","Thanks, George. As we look forward to our second quarter, net sales from our semiconductor business should be up 20% to 35%. We expect orders to remain strong approximately at the Q1 levels.","Net sales in AGS are expected to be flat to up 10%, reflecting a gradual recovery in wafer starts and utilization levels as the year progresses. We expect net sales and display to be flat to up 25%. Orders are expected to increase by more than 20% with the start of TV capacity additions and continued strength and mobility.","Net sales in EES are expected to be approximately flat remaining at low levels. Overall, we expect net sales for the company to be up 15% to 25% and our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.15.","Now, let me open the call for questions. Mike.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you, Mike. And help us reach as many of you as we can free to ask question and no more than one brief follow-up. Tiya, let\u2019s please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup","","Hi, good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong results and also wanted to pass my congratulations and best of luck after George as well. The first question then I have is related to comment that you made about, foundry spending being about 45% WFE, I believe that the comment you made. As I look at sort of the order profile, it looks like foundry was close to three quarters of your orders. So my question is, how do you see the transition from more foundry dominated order environmental memory order environment, how do you see that evolving and handing off throughout the middle to later part of the year? Thank you.","Michael R. Splinter","Sure, thanks for your questions, very good question. If you look inside our numbers close to three quarters of orders in Q1 are from foundry. As we think about the progression through the year, we do have to have broader foundry participation, but we also need to see logic investment pickup fairly dramatically in the second half along with NAND flash spending for capacity and then for 3D NAND technology. So that\u2019s kind of the progression we should start to see that by the end of our Q2 or the beginning of our Q3 that transition as foundry comes down as a percentage overall in the other areas in WFE starting to rise.","Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, terrific. And then the second question, the follow-up question is around a comment that I believe Gary made around some of the advances in transistor technology in FinFET creating a really good opportunity to gain some share and gain some tool record positions, that seems to be obviously showing up in some of the Taiwan order patterns that we are seeing with Taiwan being very strong. I am wondering if you feel like you have as good a competitive position with the other Korean partner in FinFET? Thank you.","Michael R. Splinter","Yeah, if you look at the key enabling technologies for the transistor after PVD implant thermal processes, many of these we have 70%, 75% market share overall. And in the area around the foundry customers that are ramping gate-last technology or FinFET technology, the market share is probably even higher. So this certainly provides a great opportunity for us to grow share. When I think about our overall share position in 2012 in 300 millimeter, we gain share a small amount of market share. We look at 2013 as an opportunity to even accelerate that and 2014 when the 20 nanometer gate-last is adopted by a number of foundry customers. We\u2019ve said that creates an opportunity for our CapEx to go up 30% with those customers. So we\u2019re really in a great position, building momentum through this year into 2014.","Operator","The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Bank of America.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question and my congratulations to George too. The question I had was the first one, Mike if you take your wafer fabric equipment guidance lets assume we get to the upper end of the range driven by higher foundry, NAND coming back, would you still see the seasonality of a (inaudible) that we saw last year?","Michael R. Splinter","This year is certainly a different year than last year, the foundry part of the investment that\u2019s driven by mobility and the mobility consumers that largely buying the latter half of the year really in the fourth quarter. That seasonality is still there. But especially in this kind of odd calendar year, we see more investments in logic to mute that. We think we\u2019ll see more investment in NAND flash this year, which also mutes the accentuated seasonality that we had last year. And I would just echo the point about gaining momentum here as we move into this calendar year with the strong orders that we\u2019re seeing on the front-end from the foundry.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. and then just a quick follow-up for Gary, if I look at the 3D NAND, obviously the memory guys have been working on it for a while and we haven\u2019t seen it yet to put into production. but let\u2019s reveal that maybe it\u2019s a 2014 opportunity, what is the incremental SAM expansion for Applied given the diverse product line?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yeah. So again, we do it as the 2014 timing similar to the 20-nanometer gate last ramp for our customers. So that\u2019s one of things that make us very optimistic about building momentum from a market share perspective. In the 3D NAND technology, there are a number of very long deposition steps if you look at this multilayer stacks, that are very favorable to us. And lastly, we look at the incremental CapEx opportunity for Applied on the order of 25%, it gets better as there are more layers when you\u2019re building these multilayer stacks around 25% increase in CapEx opportunity.","Operator","Your next question will come from Steven Chin with UBS.","Steven Chin \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Hi, Mike, also nice execution in the quarter and also [congrats] to George too.","George S. Davis","Thank you.","Steven Chin \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","My first question is just on the new 2013 WC outlook; I was wondering like you can kind of share more color on what customer type you\u2019re slightly more positive on, and I think originally your estimate was for foundry and logic to be down and memory to be flat to up. Is the change mostly in foundries or this is for 20-nanometer?","Michael R. Splinter","Yeah, a little more positive there, Steve. It\u2019s not a big change but I would say we\u2019re incrementally more positive as we see the front end of this year and the announcements that some of the major customers have made. We really think DRAM spending is still going to be flat at low-level year-over-year, we think foundry will be down slightly, but perhaps not down as much as we had previously anticipated. And then NAND about 15% of the total with spending profile that stronger in the second half and then logic, we are thinking will be modestly up as well year-over-year.","So in total that makes that net sale have us move up from last time we said 5% to 15% down, now we are saying 5% to down 10%. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ve moved in the last few months.","Steven Chin \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay thanks.","Michael R. Splinter","","I would like to frankly move into the positive territorial in the next three months, we\u2019ll see how the orders play out here.","Steven Chin \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Can I just have a follow-up to Gary to just about the foundry 20-nm node. You talk about some of the design wins there Gary. What percentage of the decision do you think have been made at the 20-nm foundry node and how do you think Applied is set to compete at 20-nm foundry? Thanks.","Gary E. Dickerson","So I think several have been made, I\u2019m the paranoid person and I\u2019m comfortable once the tool is in the customer\u2019s fab and paid for it. I think that we always have to be aggressive in looking at these types of situations. But certainly I think our order momentum, customers are also buying for multiple technology nodes as you know. So even when we are making 28-nm decisions there, they\u2019re looking to 2016 and future technology nodes and what your position will be there. So I think the strong increase in orders in Q1 for us is a very good sign, certainly the discussions we\u2019ve had with customers have been very positive and we are overall very optimistic, but again it\u2019s not done until the tools are in the fab and take for and so we remain focused until happens.","Steven Chin \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you very much. Last quarter you saw in a little bit more cautious on the NAND side of the business I think you were saying that there won\u2019t be any need for capacity addition. I hear a little bit more optimism and my question is that driven by what your discussion with your customers or you are more bullish on the end demand and consequently you are more bullish on NAND?","Michael R. Splinter","Well, there are several factors, here (inaudible) modestly more optimistic and I would tell you is the term modestly a couple of things we are of course, seeing strength in pricing for NAND, utilization and factories are improving. We went back and looked at our analysis of how much bid growth you need to see capacity increases and really have readjusted that, so we need to see about 45% bid growth before we seek capacity additions. And that of course, detailed discussions with customers and also we think that 3D NAND is progressing and the initial pilot line orders will come in for 3D NAND before the end of the year. So I think those things all total up to us being a little more positive on NAND flash getting stronger in the second half.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And Mike, one more question on your CFO search, if you can give us some color on what you are looking internally or externally or what\u2019s the timing we can look for maybe in terms of, then you can bring something and what particularly you are targeting when you\u2019re looking for CFO?","Michael R. Splinter","Sure. I have to tell you, we\u2019re really motivated to do this quickly. We have I think a very thorough process between Gary and I and our Board of Directors to ensure that we select the best possible candidate. We think we have several internal candidates and of course, naturally we would rather take an internal candidate than have to go outside, but we think we or for the shareholders throughout this take a look externally.","We\u2019re going to try to move through this process in a matter of weeks here, and so we\u2019ll be getting back to you on that topic as soon as we make a decision. As far as what we\u2019re looking for of course, we are looking for a very strong business partners somebody who can think strategically well experienced in financial management and acumen and somebody who can really drive shareholder return for all of our investors.","Operator","The next question will come from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah, hi, it\u2019s Mark Delaney calling on behalf of Jim Covello. Let me add my congratulations on the quarter and wish George success in his new role. I was hoping you guys could help understand a little bit more on the reorganization plan? How far along are you on implementing some of those steps and can you share with us what the employee response has been?","Michael R. Splinter","So some of the bigger changes we\u2019ve made, certainly Ali Salehpour coming in and EES and Display was a big change. And I would say that, Ali has been here for two months and the response in internally and also externally has been extremely positive, very bright, very focused on technology leadership, driving profitable growth. Ali has really hit the ground running and he is doing a great job in ESS and Display.","Another major change we\u2019ve made is in the SSG organization. We formed a new transistor group within the last month, pulling together all of the different technologies that we have under Steve Dinan. And as we\u2019ve talked about many times that\u2019s really a fantastic opportunity for Applied Materials. And so we\u2019re organizing around that strategy and that will help us in terms of execution on that opportunity.","We brought in a lot of really good people to mix with already the tremendous talent we have within Applied Materials, both on the technology and marketing side, and we had just a tremendous team, great opportunities. We\u2019re moving forward at a pretty high pace relative to these changes. So at this point, I would say many of them are in place and again we\u2019re overall very optimistic.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful, thank you. So my follow-up, I wanted to talk on the announced our plan to reduce cost further at EES. Are there parts of the business that you are actually exiting or are you still going to be addressing the same markets with lower cost footprint?","Michael R. Splinter","We\u2019re not announcing any changes in terms of the products that we have within the EES organization. We certainly driven the cost down pretty dramatically, I think in Q4 2012 we were $45 million, $50 million as we said exiting Q4 2013 and the Solar business will be down to about $20 million. So we\u2019ve cut back in terms of the OpEx spending and that money is being reallocated into some great strategic opportunities we have to grow the company. But really no announcements at this time for any exits of major products within the Solar business.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","The next question will come from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company","Hi, thanks for taking my question and I want to wish you good luck George. So actually my first question is for you, particularly your earnings guidance, you kind of imply that you are expecting gross margins to just modestly increase in the coming quarter? I was just wondering why margins are not increasing that much and terms of also kind of just tied to that in terms of OpEx that you expect to \u2013 the OpEx guidance yeah, for the coming quarter within your current run rate for the year?","George S. Davis","Yeah. So let me first deal with gross margin. We do expect gross margin to improve in the quarter as we would expect with volume. And if you look at the EPS guidance, basically what you are seeing is all of the benefit from volume and margin improvement in the quarter, so midpoint of the guidance is up $0.06. And we do include in that obviously a significant increase in OpEx, but again on OpEx, you have to look at Q1 as an anomaly. We had 535 if you take out the favorable items in there, but we also had the shutdowns, which meant that our real run rate was much closer to 550. So the rates that were going up at 560 really just reflects incremental funding moving into again, primarily into SSG and I think that rate if you look at the second half of the year will look relatively flat with that rate.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company","Great, that was very helpful. And then quick question for you Gary, I think firstly you talk about inspection, you have seen a lot of pools and etch it\u2019s an area that lead a little more time for development rate in terms of regaining shares in those two markets. How do you tasking while two segment for after spending three moments in this company?","Michael R. Splinter","Okay. Let me go through inspection first, obviously this is an area I have a lot of experience. We have a really great team, incredibly strong customer pool in 2012. In wafer inspection and review; we\u2019ve gained a few points of share. We\u2019re winning, we had some good wins in Brightfield inspection with customers here recently that also create a market share momentum for us in 2013 in wafer inspection and review. So again, overall, I would say optimistic on wafer inspection, that\u2019s a very good business for us in contributing profit to the company.","In the etch business, also we have a very good team some Customer Portal, some recent wins both in foundry and NAND Flash that make us more optimistic and again, as I\u2019ve said before, both of these markets are multiple segments and our focus is not to blow the ocean, we want to focus to the areas where we can have differentiation and we can establish a strong market share position and we have a very clear strategy in both of these different businesses as inflection happen and some technology changes happen again, I am pretty optimistic in both of these different businesses.","Operator","The next question will come from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmed \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, this is Farhan calling in for Satya. I wish my best of luck to George as well and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to check on the foundry capacity expectations for this year. If you can just tell like how much 28-nanometer (inaudible) do you expect and how much of 20-nanomee stockare for this year? If you could just tell that \u2013 nanometer be very helpful.","Michael R. Splinter","Sure, thanks. As we look at kind of foundry capacity and what we think of the added as we said at the outside of the primarily driven by strong demand in mobile and smartphones and tablets. So on the 28-nanometer area we think between 75,000 and 100,000 wafer starts per month will be added. And in 20-nanometer it\u2019s a little harder to tell, because it also depends on how well those technologies move up the yield curve. Right now we are estimating about 25,000 wafers in 20-nanometer this year and that would be really in the second half \u2013 late in the second half of the year.","Farhan Ahmed \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. And one question on the inflection and execution, Gary mentioned you have some reasons on (inaudible) I just wondering you understand how important these wins are on the inflection side, is it on 20-nanometer or 28-nanometer if you can just talk about that and whether this is like a small segment in the field or quite a big segment?","Michael R. Splinter","Well, I would say again, the customers are really working with us to cover a very large percentage of the applications for foundry and logic. And in the logic case, actually in both cases more than 50% of the applications, so I wouldn\u2019t say that there are narrow. And again as I talked about earlier, customers will buy for multiple technology node, so they will focus on certainly 28-nanometer in fact, with the running in production today, but again they want technologies that can work for 28, 20, 16 all of these different technology nodes. We are in a very strong position with logic and foundry, especially with advanced transistor technologies and again that\u2019s what makes us optimistic in that business.","Operator","The next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Mike going back to the 3D NAND, can you help us understand what the current throughput is kind of wafer per hour, wafer per day? And at what point 3D NAND would become actually economical? And I have a follow-up.","Michael R. Splinter","","Gary, maybe you can\u2026","Gary E. Dickerson","Yeah. So I think on 3D NAND, I mean there\u2019s a pretty significant increase in density. So I think as soon as the customers have those devices yielding, they\u2019re going to try to ramp in as fast as they can. The biggest issue has been being able to get the yield what they wanted to be. As I said before again, this is a really great opportunity for us, if you look at the number of deposition steps in 3D NAND process, I mean Epi is a pretty low throughput application and you start approaching those types of throughputs on wafers per hour per chamber with some of the 3D NAND application. So again for us 25% increase in CapEx opportunity as customers move to that technology.","Michael R. Splinter","So maybe I would add just briefly here that there is two aspects here. First, 3D is huge trend here not just in NAND but in transistors and packaging. It\u2019s one of the biggest inflections we are going to see over the next few years. But this is a huge change to move away from litho to find shrinking and really be able to move the process defined where precision materials engineering, interface engineering really, really matters and its why we are so excited about this area. And we think at 32 vertical bits are something like this, this is economical at 45, 50 nanometer node where companies are aiming the first generation here. But you have to believe once they solve the device and reliability issues, it will be very easy for them to move very fast both down the litho curve and increase the number of bids in the stock.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International","Okay. And then I guess my follow-up for Gary, when you go bid for new business, how should we think about the catalyst that enables you to gain market share? What else is out there other than ASP? Is that the tool throughput, is that the service, is the whole bunch of other stock that you are bundling that is enabling you to gain that market share. I\u2019m asking this because I hear from your customers that the biggest bottlenecks is now lithography. And I just wonder what is enabling you to gain market share other than pricing?","Gary E. Dickerson","Well, again, as we\u2019ve talked about before, the biggest driver in the industry today is mobility. And all of the customers are trying to differentiate on low-power and battery life. The biggest changes we\u2019ve seen in a decade and transistor technology are happening as customers move to 20-nanometer gate-last technology and FinFET. And these are areas where Applied is really riding this way. We have a very high share and the technologies that enable these new transistor structures, maybe Mike can comment. But first time in many, many years that you\u2019ve seen this type of a change, that is the number one focus for the industry where Applied has a leadership position in enabling this capability.","Michael R. Splinter","Yeah, I would just add that you know how lithography has been the story for really in the last, at least 10 years. And now we are seeing many of the bottlenecks, the interface engineering, precision materials, how are you going to get the low-k values, how are you going to keep them, and this is really an advantage for Applied Materials.","George S. Davis","And again as we talked about before, this is an increase in our opportunity of around 30%. So again, as you are adding an epi step that\u2019s worth hundreds of millions of dollars with one step that\u2019s added to the transistor. So if you look at all of the technologies, where we have leadership around the transistor, this is really a fantastic opportunity for us to grow share.","Operator","The next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus","Patrick J. Ho \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you very much. Maybe first for Mike, excluding the largest foundry, how do you see the trends for spending for the second tier foundries or at least the rest of the group in terms of how 2013 plays out?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes. Well, certainly we\u2019re expecting return of those other members of the foundry community to start spending in the second half of the year. This will be really a key for us and how our order momentum is occurring at the end of our second quarter. We\u2019ve always expected them to really have their spending in our late Q2 or in the Q2 calendar year and in the Q3 calendar year. So that\u2019s our current expectation on the remainder of the foundry group. I would say we need that spending to broaden out certainly to reach the high-end of our WFE estimate.","Patrick J. Ho \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Great, that\u2019s helpful. Gary, maybe specifically on the technology side, when you are varying, you brought up the whole materials modification and a lot of technology synergy between iron, implant and etch. Can you maybe give a little bit of color on how some of \u2013 now that you two as a combined company, how that maybe giving you an advantage right now and particularly on the etch side and that being a driver of future share gains.","Gary E. Dickerson","Got to say, I kind of feel like a kid in the candy store here in Applied. We again, think to me that it\u2019s so exciting is that we have leadership in many areas of precision materials engineering and this creates tremendous opportunities for us as a company. The one thing that we don\u2019t talk about and unfortunately I can\u2019t talk about here, but there are opportunities for us in the integrated processes, linking different parts of our product portfolio together that are creating positive momentum for us today and I think as you move forward to some of these future device structures and interface engineering and some of these areas becoming more critical, the magnitude of that opportunity is going to increase.","Gary E. Dickerson","Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","The next question will come from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish Iyer \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Congrats George from side as well. So two questions, just wanted to highlight; first, on the logic spending, Mike, you did earlier to the fact that they would probably becoming bad. What is that \u2013 which is currently driving could potentially drive logic spending, given that the PC outlook seems to be pretty tempered for this year?","Michael R. Splinter","Well, first of all, it changed to the next-generation of technology where we\u2019re seeing 25% to 35% increase in capital intensity, that movement of course is very important and very relevant to us. But then the other thing that can drive up logic spending is some growth in PCs this year. As I alluded to there has been an introduction of Windows 8. There is our touch Ultrabooks now. If these things start to catch on in the back-to-school time period, this could be very beneficial for us in logic spending in the latter part of the year.","Jagadish Iyer \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thanks. And just as a follow-up, I just wanted to understand on the Display side. How should we think about new fabs coming online? Can you give us some color in terms of how many Gen 10 fabs are coming, or is it going to be driven by Gen 8.5? Any color on the fabs and under generation would be very helpful and how Applied is going to be benefited this time versus the prior generations? Thank you.","Michael R. Splinter","Sure, maybe I can start and Gary can finish. On the \u2013 as we start this current generation of TV fabs will be Gen 8.5. But what we are seeing in primarily in China, we are starting to see the orders come in for those factories. So that\u2019s really quite beneficial for us. We think that 60-inch TVs are starting to get to the price point that to a real volume price point are now starting to approach a $1,000 very soon, under $1,000. That kind of a price point will drive the industry to Gen 10 just because of how many TVs you can get on one sheet of glass and to make that economical. But it\u2019s pretty clear to us now that while we haven\u2019t had a glass size change in, I guess five years that there is one that\u2019s really going to come. Gary, you might want to talk about with \u2013 also with the increased pixel density what we see as our advantages.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yeah, as customers go to larger area, larger panels, and smaller pixels, again it\u2019s the same thing you see in the semiconductor industry, where you have to drive to lower particles to get acceptable yield, uniformity becomes more difficult in these larger areas. And that really plays to the device performance and yield advantages that we have in our CVD and PVD products and that will create very strong momentum for us from a share and margin standpoint in that business.","Michael R. Splinter","And we\u2019ve also really been investing in these next generations of technology as these new fabs eventually convert to metal oxide. We are going to be in a very good position to be able to take advantage of that as well.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Jagadish.","Operator","The next question will come from Ben Pang with B. Riley Caris.","Ben Pang \u2013 B. Riley Caris","","Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the growth forecast that you have for the SSG business, you commented on your ability to outgrow the overall sector based on transistor and PDC, what\u2019s the \u2013 I guess the wafer fab equipment if you split out transistor by itself? Is there a significant difference between 2013 and 2012?","Gary E. Dickerson","Transistor products I think are little over 50% of our total SSG business I think it\u2019s roughly that in plant.","Michael R. Splinter","Yeah.","Ben Pang \u2013 B. Riley Caris","So I mean in terms of the industry growth rate is there \u2013 I am just trying to get a feel for 28-nanometer versus 20-nanometer, how much is really going to the transistor, is there a big growth difference?","Gary E. Dickerson","Again, what we are seeing for the transistors you go from 28-nanometer to 20-nanometer gate-last, the market opportunity goes up for us roughly 30% if you think an equivalent number of wafer start and then it goes up again maybe another 10% as you go to FinFET technology. So that\u2019s again for equivalent number of wafer starts.","Ben Pang \u2013 B. Riley Caris","Okay, thank you very much and good luck to George as well.","George S. Davis","Thank you so much.","Michael R. Splinter","Thanks. And yeah I think we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Yes, sir. The final question will come from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask you a question on the OpEx guidance, does this guidance include spending on 450 millimeter or are you sort of thinking about 450 millimeter later this year or early next year?","Michael R. Splinter","It does. It\u2019s our full OpEx picture.","Vishal Shah \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. And then on the foundry spending expectations, when you think about the orders for the next couple of quarters, what percentage of your orders do you expect from 20-nanometer, I mean they are all going to be second half rated, or do you see some activity from customers even in the first half?","Michael R. Splinter","We think orders on 20-nanometer are certainly going to be, maybe we\u2019ll see them in the fourth quarter drives in our fiscal first quarter as we think most of that capacity will be growing in mostly for the end of the year.","Vishal Shah \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. And just I mean how do you think 2014 foundry spending looks like, I mean do you see 20-nanometer keeping foundry spending relatively high, or do you see that is an area of weakness when you think about in the next year?","Michael R. Splinter","Yeah, I think we\u2019ll hold off, but the mobility trends we believe is here to say, and I think you\u2019re still will be strong growth in mobility of \u2013 that\u2019s the case we\u2019re going to see some foundry spending, a little too early for us to make a protection about 2014 right now.","Gary E. Dickerson","What I would say also\u2026","Vishal Shah \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I appreciate it.","Gary E. Dickerson","Again on mobility, this is the major focus for our customers is where everyone is trying to differentiate in brad share and certainly looks like customer ramp 20-nanometer gate-last processes. The people that are there ramping those processes will have a competitive advantage and that\u2019s what we would anticipate in 2014.","Vishal Shah \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I appreciate, guys. Thank you.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, thank you, Vish. And we would like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 pm Pacific time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"3005":["Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) Q1 2017 Earnings Call February 15, 2017  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Gary E.

We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter of fiscal 2017 earnings conference call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied's current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions, revenue growth, profitability, and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and are not guarantees of future performance.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. I'm happy to report that Applied Materials delivered another record quarter in Q1. With earnings and orders exceeding all-time highs, 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year. As I look ahead, I see broad-based strength in our markets as large multiyear inflections evolve and new emerging demand drivers layer on top of mobility and computing. I'm also increasingly confident that Applied is positioned to sustainably grow faster than our markets, as we realize the benefits of the investments we have been making in our organization and product pipeline.","On today's call, I'll begin with a quick recap of our strategy and provide an update on the key trends and industry inflections that are driving our growth. I'll then translate these into an outlook for Applied's markets before concluding with a brief overview for each of our businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our performance and his perspective on 2017 and beyond.","The significant changes in semiconductor and display technology that are taking place today depend on materials innovation. At Applied, our strategy is to deliver innovative materials engineering technologies to enable these major inflections. Across the company, we are focused on extending our innovation leadership and delivering solutions that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before.","As I've outlined previously, there are five large multiyear inflections that are underpinning our record performance today and we believe will fuel our growth for years to come. I'm going to take a few minutes to provide an update on each of these drivers as well as describe how our strategy of inflection-focused innovation positions Applied for sustainable profitable growth.","Let me begin with 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies in foundry and logic. We are seeing significant investments by our customers to meet demand for leading-edge silicon to power increasingly capable mobile devices, 4K video, and new compute-intensive applications like artificial intelligence and smart vehicles. This sustained investment in advanced technology plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses, where we have unique capabilities and high market share.","The second driver is 3D NAND, which is a great example of materials-enabled scaling. We believe NAND bit demand grew about 45% in 2016 and that 2017 will be similar. Major memory companies are saying this growth rate is sustainable over the next several years.","Our opportunity in NAND is also expanding. While 3D NAND has significant performance and power advantages, the bit density increase achieved moving from generation to generation is slower than it was for planar NAND. To compensate, more wafer starts are needed.","The third driver for Applied is patterning, a market which is growing rapidly. It's important to recognize that as customers move to smaller chip geometries, all the layers in the device scale. Some layers will move to EUV [Extreme Ultraviolet] and others to multi-patterning. This means that even in the most aggressive EUV adoption case, our patterning opportunity still expands considerably. Patterning is an area where Applied is making significant investments. We increased our patterning revenues more than 60% in 2016, and we have significant room to grow.","Beyond semiconductor, another unique growth driver for Applied is advanced display, where two major market inflections are underway. The first is rapid growth in large-format TVs 60 inches and above, which is driving investment in new Gen 10.5 capacity as customers optimize factories for bigger screen sizes. We are now tracking seven Gen 10.5 projects.","In parallel, there's a battle for leadership in next-generation mobile screens, and demand for our OLED manufacturing equipment is broadening. We see half of this demand coming from new entrants. As a result, in the past few months, our view of display spending has strengthened further. We now see customers increasing their investments by around $3 billion in 2017, $1 billion more than we thought in November. Our early view of 2018 is also positive.","The fifth driver I'll cover is China, which is an important long-term growth opportunity for Applied in both semiconductor and display. While we believe 2017 spending will be similar to last year, based on the new factory projects we are tracking, we expect to see a significant ramp in investment in 2018 and beyond.","Now, I'll translate these major inflections into our market outlook. Due to strong shipments in December, we now believe 2016 wafer fab equipment spending ended the year at around $35 billion. We expect 2017 to be higher still, up 5% or more year on year. Within this spending, we see strength across the board with foundry, NAND, DRAM, and logic investments all growing relative to 2016.","Our early view of 2018 wafer fab equipment is also positive for a number of reasons. We see foundry investment broadening. We believe memory fundamentals will remain strong, fueled by explosive growth in data and investment in new technologies. When we look at customers' total capital spending, we see healthy investment in new factory shells, and we expect spending in China to accelerate in 2018 and beyond.","Looking to the future, we're increasingly excited about trends in virtual and augmented reality, big data, and artificial intelligence and smart vehicles. These new applications require major advances in silicon and display technology and create huge demand for memory. These new drivers layer on top of existing demand for mobility, PCs, and other consumer electronics and have the potential to fuel a new phase of industry growth. All of this reinforces our perspective that our markets are becoming stronger and less cyclical.","I'll now provide a brief update on each of our major businesses. In semiconductor, 2016 was a big share gain year for Applied. While we'll wait for Gartner's final sizing in April before providing all the details, we believe we have gained around 2 points of overall wafer fab equipment share. These gains are broad-based, with especially strong adoption of our new products.","In 2016, about 40% of our revenue came from products that we've launched in the past three years. We have great momentum and fully expect to add to these gains in 2017. In our first quarter, semi equipment revenue and orders were at a 16-year high, with our highest orders ever in etch, CVD, and processed diagnostics and control.","In display, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and orders. Since 2012, we have grown display revenues around 20% per year, and we believe we'll book $2 billion of orders in 2017. As display technology becomes more complex, we are focused on building out our product portfolio to deliver the solutions our customers need. We have great traction with our new thin film encapsulation and e-beam review products and have more significant new products that we'll announce later this year.","In Service, our strategy is to deliver more value to customers with our advanced service products. We're focused on reducing ramp times, improving device performance and yield, and optimizing output and operating costs for our customers. We're seeing the impact of our investments and are increasing our share of the service opportunity. On a year-on-year basis, we've now grown our service business for 13 consecutive quarters, and our orders in Q1 were also an all-time high.","Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me quickly summarize. Q1 was another record-breaking quarter, and we expect 2017 to be an outstanding year for the company. The large multiyear inflections that are driving our business remain firmly in place, and our markets are growing and becoming less cyclical. We expect wafer fab equipment and display investments to be up in 2017, and our initial view of 2018 is also positive.","Our inflection-focused innovation strategy is delivering results. We are outperforming in semiconductor with strong share gains, sustainably growing our service business, and we are uniquely positioned to drive significant growth in display. Overall, we are increasingly confident that we can maintain our trajectory of sustainable growth and raise the ceiling on our performance.","Now, I'll ask Bob to provide more details about our results and outlook. Bob?","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. Applied's momentum continues in the new fiscal year, with record orders and earnings both up substantially from a year ago, and we're guiding for new revenue and earnings records in Q2. For investors with a long memory, this kind of performance raises old questions about peaks and sustainability. However, I'm confident that our markets are materially better, and I believe that Applied's ability to deliver value and profitability is increasingly stronger and more sustainable.","Last quarter I gave you numbers showing that the industry is now larger and significantly less volatile. Some of you did the math and saw that this is true. I believe investors will come to recognize that the industry truly is more attractive, owing to three important factors.","First is that our customers have fully absorbed a tremendous amount of productivity. The list includes: the 300-millimeter wafer size transition; cycle time reductions; supplier consolidation, including the IDM [Integrated Device Manufacturer] to foundry transition; the shift to highly productive mega-fabs; better inventory management; reuse strategies; and disciplined profit-minded investment by our customers.","Second is capital intensity. A steadily rising amount of capital equipment is needed to build each type of chip, and customers increasingly need the kind of equipment Applied makes. For example, patterning smaller lines takes more CVD, CMP, and etch steps. Logic and foundry chips need more metal layers and new materials. And 3D NAND memories add bits at a slower rate than 2D shrinks. You can see these factors playing out in the capital intensity curves for the industry.","Third is that we are seeing more demand drivers. In NAND, server farms are early in the transition from hard disks to solid-state drives. In logic and foundry, leading technology and automotive companies are designing custom high-performance chips for artificial intelligence. Manufacturers are adding sensors, intelligence, and communications into all kinds of commercial and consumer products, creating the Internet of Things. The additional data that's being created drives further demand for advanced processors and memory. And we have many engagements with new companies in China who are strategically committed to participating in future waves of growth.","Gary mentioned that we expect WFE spending to be up by over 5% this year, which would give us the highest level of investment seen to date. 2017 investment does not include a wafer size transition as in 2000 or a surge in commodity DRAM investment as in 2007 or an unusually large year of MOCVD spending as in 2011. In fact, I believe our 2017 forecast reflects measured prudent customer spending designed to meet strong demand patterns that we are seeing continue into 2018 and beyond. Our customers will continue to benefit from making big investments in leading-edge capacity to power devices and the cloud.","I believe concerns about the cost\/benefit of Moore's Law are anchored on the value of yesterday's applications. Consider the value being created by companies who are using technology to transform industries like advertising, retailing, transportation, television, and travel. Today, they are making massive investments in new applications that depend on further innovations in processors, memories, and displays, and a lot more capacity. I see a very healthy future in this for Applied Materials.","At Applied, we changed the investment model to deliver higher returns. We aggressively shifted dollars from G&A to R&D and from sustaining R&D to impactful new product R&D. We significantly increased the percentage of winning products, and we accelerated our new product development timelines. These trends have multiplicative effects and are continuing. As a result, we are outperforming our markets and benefiting from delivering more valuable products and services to our customers.","Let's start with revenue growth. As Gary said, we expect WFE spending to grow by around 5% or more in calendar 2017. In fiscal 2017, we anticipate that our Services group will grow at twice that rate. Our Semiconductor Systems business will grow at four times that rate, and our Display business will grow at 10 times that rate. As a result, we are gaining share in our markets.","The best indication of the value that we provide is profit margins. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 45.4% in Q1, the second highest since 2008. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26%, a 9-year high. And next quarter, we plan to be higher in both.","Our revenue growth and margin expansion are resulting in strong free cash flow, which grew by more than 300% in Q1 from the same period last year. And we are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders.","In addition, we're closely monitoring the policy environment. As a U.S.-based manufacturer with strong exports and a global manufacturing network, we have a great deal of flexibility in adapting to the new policies being considered.","Next, I'll comment on our performance during Q1 as compared to the same period last year. Orders of $4.2 billion were our highest ever and broad-based. We had a 16-year high in semiconductor systems orders, record orders in services, and very strong display orders of $632 million. In Q1, we grew company revenue by 45% and increased non-GAAP gross margin by 300 basis points. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew by 14% to the high end of the guidance range. Our ongoing spending discipline helped us to more than double our non-GAAP operating profit. We've reduced the non-GAAP tax rate by 6.2 points, and we grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 158%.","Next, I'll compare our segment performance during Q1 to the same period last year. We grew Semiconductor Systems revenue by 57% and non-GAAP operating margin by 11.5 points. We grew Services revenue by 12% and non-GAAP operating profit by 1.9 points. We also grew display revenue by 66% and non-GAAP operating profit by 8.4 points.","On the balance sheet, we grew cash and investments by 23% to $5.1 billion, and about 36% remained onshore. We paid cash dividends of $108 million and used $130 million for stock buybacks, reducing the ending share count by 5% year over year to 1.08 billion.","Now I'll provide our guidance for the second quarter. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.6 billion. The midpoint would be up by 44% year over year. On a year-over-year basis, our Semiconductor Systems revenue should increase by about 51%. Services revenues should increase by about 9%, and display revenue should increase by about 122%.","In addition, non-GAAP gross margin should be about 45.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $645 million plus or minus $10 million. And non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $0.72 to $0.80, the midpoint of which would be up by 124% year over year.","In summary, we are raising the ceiling on our expectations for the industries we serve, and we believe our markets will remain strong. We've fundamentally changed our investment model to deliver greater value to our customers, and we are seeing that value reflected in higher market share and profitability. This stronger performance is sustainable, resulting in greater free cash flow.","Now, Mike, let's start the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please poll the operator and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Our first question is from Farhan Ahmad of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks for taking my question. My first question is in regards to the linearity of the year. Some of your peers have indicated a significant decline in the second half of the year, primarily driven by 3D NAND, and I just wanted to understand. Is that something you are seeing as well?","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","Sure, Farhan. So let me give you some context for how we think about the year and longer term. We are really driving, Farhan, frankly achieving sustainable year-over-year growth in revenue and share of profit. That's how we think about the business and look at it. As for 2017, this will be another good year. We see WFE up 5% or more in the year. And then for our fiscal year, as I said in the call, our semiconductor revenue should grow at 4x that rate. Our services revenue should grow at 2x that rate, and our display revenue would grow at over 10x that rate. So if you look at it, we gave you actuals for Q1 and guide for Q2. Our full year should model just as I said just now. So with that, I think you get a pretty good feel for the second half of the year for us.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Farhan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from C.J. Muse out of Evercore. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question around display. How should we be thinking about the linearity of spend there first half\/second half on a calendar year basis? And then considering I think you said in the prepared remarks you expect to book roughly $2 billion of revenues there here in the calendar year. How should we think about the trajectory of revenues through calendar 2018? And I guess as part of that, I would love to hear your thoughts on new product introductions and when we should think about weaving I guess incremental revenues from there in there as well. Thank you.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","Sure, I'll start, and Gary can jump in. Display continues to go up for us, frankly. In terms of the market context, when we did the Analyst Day back in September in New York, we thought that 2016 would be WFE numbers of around $14.5 billion, as I remember, and we thought the next year would be about a similar number in calendar 2017. And we're thinking now it's about $17.4 billion in 2017, so the market is up about $3 billion from where we thought. In terms of our own performance, I'll do bookings first. We booked over $2 billion in 2016. We weren't sure we could get that same volume in 2017 because some of those 2016 bookings ship through 2017 and 2018. In fact, we now think the bookings are pretty close in 2017 to what they were in 2016.","What's particularly interesting for me in that bookings mix for 2017 is, if you go back to history, we used to be about 60% or so of our bookings were mobile, 65% some years, and about \u2013 65% for TVs, 35% mobile. It kind of flipped last year. We thought we'd continue that this year. We're strong in both this year. TV has come back strong. We mentioned the Gen 10.5 fab. We see seven more of those we're tracking. So this year we think we'll book about 55% for TV, 45% mobile, so strong in both frankly.","Then if you look at the revenues, which you asked about, this year we think our revenues are going to be pretty strong throughout the year. In terms of the quarterization, it's a little lumpy. Our Q3 might be a little stronger than our Q2, but pretty strong every quarter.","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","I could add a little bit more also, C.J., on display. So if you put display in perspective, it's a great example of our ability to take materials engineering into an adjacent market. And if you go over a four-year period of time, from 2012 to 2016, our orders have increased from around $400 million to $2 billion, so \u2013 over $2 billion, about a 5x increase in four years in display, which is incredible. But again, it shows the ability to take our materials innovation technologies, CVD, PVD, thin film encapsulation, into a new market.","And we've talked about \u2013 Bob talked about the TV sizes increasing and the seven Gen 10.5 projects. OLED, mobile is also expanding to new customers. 50% of our demand going forward for this year is new customers for the mobile OLED.","And then we've been focused on inflections and increasing our total available market. We've talked about tripling our served market as we go forward. And certainly as these new technologies like OLED or flexible OLED are adopted, that increases our total available market. We've been driving new technologies like thin film encapsulation and e-beam review, again, reusing technologies that we have within our semiconductor business in display.","You ask about the new products that we've talked about, and what we've said is that we'll announce those sometime during 2017. But what I would say \u2013 and we're not going to do that today, but what I would say is that those projects are on track and tremendous customer pull and investment for those new opportunities.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, C.J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. So I just wanted to try to ask the question again, Bob, just on the learnings for the year. So if you look at your run rate based upon what you just booked, and if I assume roughly 25% WFE share, which is in your model, you're run-rating at roughly $44 billion \u2013 not you, but the industry. And if the year is going to be $37 billion, the math would say that you have to get to $30 billion sometime during the back half of the year. Now maybe things don't fall off that much. But I'm just wondering if you can take those numbers and tell us if you think shipments are going to fall off during the back half of the year because the math seems to say that either shipments are going to fall off quite a bit or WFE is going to be a lot better than $37 billion this year. Thanks.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","Sure, yes. So, Tim, I gave you some color on the first half\/second half for us a little bit. I'll give you a little more specific to your question. I don't know that the industry is running at quite $44 billion now. And our model was to get 25.5% market share in 2019. We think we're well on track to that. I'm not sure we're at that point right now, so in terms of the mathematics, it's a little bit different.","Further, what I'll say to you is that the stuff I said to you earlier would imply the first half is strong. I don't disagree with that. But what I will also tell you is that we have seen the Q3 and Q4 numbers for us firm up as we go month by month the last few months. So my take on it, 2017 is a strong year. It's going to be a particularly strong year for Applied as we gain more share and display does well for us. We also think that 2018, 2019 we see growth drivers that are really good for us and the industry the next couple years. Will the second half be as strong as the first half? I'm not sure it is, but the overall trends are positive.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and guide. Gary, some investors are still skeptical on China spending coming in 2018. Can you just provide a bit more color or details on how your engagements are going with Chinese domestic projects?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Sure, let me give you some color on China. So what we're looking at in 2017 for China for Applied Materials is up versus 2016, maybe something like 10% up overall for us. And if you look at 2017 versus 2015, it's up maybe an additional $1 billion overall. Semi is slightly lower in that mix. Display is higher and service is higher. If you look at 2015 versus 2017, we've had 2x growth or anticipating 2x growth in semi revenue and about 50% growth in service and display. And China is really one of our strongest regions both with the multinational companies and the domestic companies there.","And as we spend a lot of time and we have very deep relationships with the companies that are there, basically what we hear is that there is a big strategic drive in investment in China. There's a big gap in terms of domestic supply versus demand, and then there's also a drive to build a secure supply chain. So I think all of us see announcements and very large investments over the next several years in China.","In talking to those customers, they I believe understand that this is a long-term strategy. They have Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3. And in the beginning, those investments aren't going to be as efficient, especially in the more advanced technologies. But what I would say is that very consistently we see strong drive from a strategic perspective for increased investment in China, and really what we're seeing is 2018 and beyond a significant increase. Again, we increased semi revenue 2x from 2015 to 2017. If you ask me, what do I think 2017 to 2019, that's going to be up a significant amount in semiconductor opportunity.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Atif.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Chin of UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, Gary and Bob, nice quarter and guidance too. I have a follow-up question on the display order guidance. Can you share, Gary, how much of the display orders this year, the $2 billion likely come from the Chinese display customers? Because I know we're all waiting for domestic China's semiconductor spend to happen. But can sales to China's display customers bridge us over until the domestic spend of CapEx happens in China next year?","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","I'll start. We're pulling up some slides to help us. So total bookings this year will be over $2 billion in display. We see a lot of the big orders out of China for TVs in particular and some for mobile. So this is the wrong slide. So the numbers are large numbers for China this year. I'd say the majority of the display stuff is probably China. China revenue, okay, so the majority of the $2 billion, my guess \u2013 I'm looking for the slide, frankly, is probably of the display bookings, probably half or more is China.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I also had a display question. So, Bob, if you look at last year, you did about $2 billion in bookings and about $1 billion in revenue. Should we expect that gap to close as you roll forward with new products and OLED gets more traction, or do you think the book to revenue is going to still have a lag effect here? And along the same path, what percentage of your bookings or revenue last year was OLED versus traditional displays? Thank you.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","So your question is the book-to-bill, what's it going to stay for display, and then how much was OLED? I guess that's the question.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's right, yes.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","So last year we booked over $2 billion. And we billed \u2013 now remember, we moved the web business in there and the service upgrade business, and we billed about 55% of that. This year we're going to book over $2 billion, but we'll bill a higher percentage of that. It's still going to be north of one.","In terms of the outlook beyond 2017 \u2013 2018, we're continuing strong book-to-bill \u2013 continuing strong bookings, but the book-to-bill narrows. Last year it was 1.6 or 1.7 or something like that. It was a big number, so that's going to trend down over time. But it will stay positive for a while.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Krish.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","OLED was \u2013 if you look at last year, OLED booking \u2013 mobile bookings were 65% of the total. And of the mobile piece, which was 65%, the majority of that was OLED.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on the solid execution. I think in the prior question you answered, you talked about 50% roughly of your bookings for flat-panel being China-focused. I'm assuming most of this is large screen. But if we look at the Tier 2 OLED players in China, these guys are trying to play catch-up to the leaders in the market. Our research indicates that China is probably going to account for about 30% of the OLED CapEx spend in 2018, which is up significantly from this year's mix levels. So I'm just wondering if you guys are starting to see this trend and just wondering if this is already starting to show up in the order books or the backlog. Or is that still on the come?","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yes, it's true. So you've got a couple questions there. You've got the China question and the OLED proliferation question. So if you look at China, as I said earlier, we sell for TV and mobile. TV is pretty big in China this year. But drilling into your question more around OLED and mobile, as we said on the call last time, I think we repeated it this time, we had orders from 10 different OLED manufacturers in the last year, predominantly in the last couple of quarters. Nine of those are for mobile phones, one was a lighting guy. So if you look at the mobile guys, it's proliferating such that beyond the number one leader in OLED, we think that in 2017 our orders for OLED mobile is going to be probably over half from the followers, not just in China though.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. It looked like you made nice progress on the operating margin on the display side. Can you talk about where that can go? And can you remind us where that business stands on gross and operating margins versus the semi business? Thank you.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","Sure. We did make nice progress on the display business. So if you go look at it, we're up significantly this year on the operating margins for display in the quarter in particular. We think the year is going to be up a fair amount year on year. We're well on track to hit the margins in the model in display FY 2019. Not every quarter is going to be exactly the same in display. My guess is Q2 may not be quite as high as Q1, but the year is going to be up significantly from last year.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you and congratulations. At the analyst meeting in September, you talked about earnings of $2.80 on I think it was like a $35 billion WFE. This quarter it looks like you're run-rating closer to $3 two years earlier than what we anticipated. So if WFE is coming in at $37 billion this year and you guys think it will hold up again next year, Bob, what's maybe a more reasonable range to think about earnings in fiscal 2019 because the $2.80 does look increasingly conservative?","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","There are a few things. I think we'll do very well against that model. That model had a few assumptions. It assumed a $34.5 billion WFE, and right now we're running a little north of that, frankly. There was a $37 billion model we showed that same day which was $3.17.","And the second thing was the market environment in that model was we assumed that the display equipment spending was going to be north of the historical number of $8 billion but not necessarily up to what we realized last year, $14.5 billion. So I would say in market environment, condition number one in those models, I'm more optimistic that the environment in 2019 is north of the $34.5 billion, and I'm more optimistic that the market environment for display spending is north of what we have in our model. So the market is positively biased towards our base model last year, which was at $2.80.","The second thing is the share position we had in both semi and display, and we said we'd do 25.5 points in semi and we thought we'd be in a strong position in display. We are very confident of that. We gained 2 points in 2016, up to about 22%, so we've got to get about a point a year the next three years. We'll hit those numbers I think, probably some upside. And then in display, the market, our products look good against the revenue in that plan. So I'd say that the function of share and market result in a revenue opportunity against that model.","I think what pleases me as much as anything, frankly, in the results we announced today and for next quarter is the margin profile. We had in the past iteration of the model, we didn't move much on the margins. We said that the base model would be at 44.6% gross margins, and some people were a little skeptical because we hadn't moved too much. We reported today, what was it, 45.2% I guess it was 45.4% actuals, 45.4%.","And then what we said about gross margins last quarter was that in fiscal 2017 we'd be up to about 44% in the year. That was a gain of 0.8 point. We now think in fiscal 2017 alone, instead of 0.8-point gain versus 2016, we're going to gain 1.5 points. So if you look at that on the model you asked about, we're probably very comfortable that we can hit the 44.6% gross margin, which is at the $34.5 billion. And the 45.1%, which is at $37 billion, we're probably pretty comfortable.","And then we maintain pretty damn tight control on the operating expenses too. So if you back-calculate the guide we give for next quarter, now next quarter is a good quarter, its operating margin is north of 27%. So in the annual models we showed for 2019, we showed operating margins of about 25.1% the $34.5 billion and 26.4% in the $37 billion environment. So at the operating margin we're making progress. And then if you finally go down to the URs, we simply shrink the share count to 1.044 billion. We're confident we'll hit that.","So we're not going to redo the model today. But around the market environment relative to that model, around our share position relative to the model, around our execution on gross margins, OpEx, and share count, we're pretty confident that we'll hit or potentially beat that model.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Romit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Ho of Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter and the projected outlook for 2017. Gary, maybe just looking at 3D NAND and the market opportunity still going forward, you guys obviously have made great inroads in terms of etch and deposition, capital intensity, but also your own share gains. As you look at the industry moving to 64 layers and then eventually to 96 layers, one, how do you see the capital intensity trends for the market overall? And maybe secondly for Applied, how do you see your competitive position increasing as the industry progresses?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","So let me take on our position, and Bob can talk about maybe capital intensity. So as we talked about overall, we gained 2 points of share in 2016, and actually our strongest gains are in 3D NAND. And one of the really big drivers for our company is that 3D NAND is materials-enabled scaling versus litho-enabled scaling.","I met three of the top four memory CEOs in the last month. All of them are very bullish. The pull that they have for 3D NAND is really tremendous. And if you look in servers, for instance, and the total cost of ownership and the power consumption, I was in our data center, it's 80% less power consumption, and total cost of ownership is significantly better. So all of the people I'm talking to are very bullish about 3D NAND.","Our position in 3D NAND, as we've talked about, we increase our TAM, our total available market by a factor of three. And when we're talking also about operating margins and our opportunities in display or in semi, our strategy is to focus on inflections. So we're winning share in inflections and we're also delivering new capabilities. And so that comes through in 40% of our revenue being introduced from products that were introduced in the last three years. Just in 2016, our etch revenue was up 30%, CVD 33%, CMP revenue up 33%. Our e-beam products, another area where there's a big inflection, the largest part of our PDC business, up 33%. So we see tremendous pull.","And as you go to these future generations of 3D NAND, it's really all about materials innovation, how you scale to those additional numbers of layers, and we're in a really great position. The pull that we have from our customers is earlier, deeper, and broader than we've ever seen in the past. And Bob can talk maybe about the capital intensity.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","On 3D NAND?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","So what was your comparison, again, Patrick, which to which, which layer to which layer? I'll see if I can fill in. So the capital intensity for 3D NAND if you go from planar to, say, 50 layers, the total CapEx is about $3.5 billion on planar, and 48 layers it's about $5 billion for greenfield. Now I think the thing that's interesting is if we go from a planar reuse to a 50-layer or 48-layer, the total CapEx to upgrade is $2.6 billion, $3.2 billion, almost the same as the opportunity in planar at $3.5 billion. Now what's really interesting for a company like us, materials is very etch and deposition-intensive.","Now what's particularly interesting for Applied Materials additionally to that, to be frank, one, we didn't have the products or incumbent positions at the planar position, so the level of reuse for Applied is very low. And you can see in our share gains, which have really been driven in etch, CVD, and some in CMP, is around the share gains we have made within etch, CVD, and CMP around some of these conversions from planar to 3D NAND, and also some on DRAM.","So one, total spend is bigger. Two, it's really etch and deposition-intensive. And three, it's been really good for Applied Materials within those products in the transition.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question from Edwin Mok of Needham. Your line is open.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Operator, we're not hearing Edwin.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Sorry about that. So I want to ask you guys about foundry logic. Just from your last report to this report, have you seen more broadening of demand in 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer or in the tray mesh? It sounds like you guys got a little more in China. (47:15)","And then on IMIS (47:20), specifically on 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer, in terms of optioning or growth in 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer, is it more just complex transistors that allows you to (47:27) demand more of your product because you have such strong around transistor technology, or is it that you expect share gain around patterning at 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer that allows you to grow in that as those nodes go into production?","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","I'll do the first one, and Gary will do more the second one. So on broadening, this has been a year that's interesting in foundry. What might surprise you that of the trailing edge, and I'll define trailing-edge as 20-nanometer, 28-nanometer and above, 45-nanometer. It's 40% in 2017 will be that's those nodes, and you've got 55% we think for 7-nanometer and 10-namometer, and about 5% 14-nanometer, 16-nanometer. So what's the point? 40% of spend this year in the foundries is 20-nanometer and above, so it's really strong. Last year it was about 38%. So in a bigger spend year it's actually a bigger percentage, which is interesting.","Now, so what you have this year is spending by the biggest foundry leader pretty strong and pretty big spending at the trailing nodes. And the opportunity you have to sustain foundry spending, which people are questioning about next year, is that we think that in 2018 we're going to have continued spending at the trailing edge. We think secondly, we're going to have a broadening of foundry spending, particularly next year. You asked about broadening of spending. I think it's a bigger impact next year because if you look at the shells they're putting up and the opportunities in SMIC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES in China and places like that, you're going to see some broadening of that.","In terms of the leading edge on 10-nanometer\/7-nanometer, by the end of this year you're going to have 120,000 to 140,000 wafer starts of capacity for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. We think that could probably at its peak double. So there's still some chance to broaden out 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer next year. So next year we're not pessimistic on foundry. We think there's obviously: A), the trailing edge is strong, number one. Number two, we see some still significant additions for 10-nanometer\/7-nanometer, whether it's conversions or greenfield. And three, we see broadening among some of the customer base.","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","So on the share gains, we have, as Bob talked about, I think pretty good line of sight on 7-nanometer and very strong pull for our transistor and interconnect products where we have extremely high share, and we're seeing more steps and an increase in our total available market as you go to 7-nanometer.","In addition to the three memory CEOs I met, I also met the head of R&D for our largest logic and foundry customers within the last month. And what I would say is that we have stronger pull for earlier, deeper, and broader collaborations than we've ever had in the history of Applied Materials. And one of the things that we're really focused on, if you go past 7-nanometers, how do we enable our customers to build devices that they could never build before. So certainly we have great pull for new products like Selectra, which again gives designers a capability that they never had before in designing new types of devices. And you will definitely see and we're seeing the ability to grow as fast as we can qualify with this kind of new capability.","We have new films that our customers are adopting for 5-nanometer and beyond that also enable them to design devices in different ways. And certainly the transistor, interconnect patterning is another area we've talked about where we have tremendous pull with Sym3 across the board for logic and foundry customers. The Selectra, Olympia, Precision CVD, PROVision, the LK Prime for CMP, we're in the early innings of adoption of many of those products.","And as you go beyond 7-nanometer, the opportunities for us even become much larger for these products and other products that we have in our pipeline. So for me, those conversations with those people running R&D are incredibly exciting, and the pull is really tremendous for Applied.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Edwin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into I guess China and NAND a little bit more directly. A company a couple weeks ago, small cap, said that they thought their revenue from NAND memory customers would increase in the second half, partly driven by domestic Chinese memory producers, so some of these new fab projects that have been in the works. I'm just wondering if you're actually seeing any of that kind of demand that you would actually commit to maybe delivering some equipment in the second half, or if you still think those domestic projects might be more of a 2018 event.","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","We definitely see \u2013 we're engaged with all of those different companies. Our share in China is the highest or near the highest that we have for any region, so our engagement with those companies are very strong. We don't really see in 2017 significant revenue growth coming from those companies. Again, our overall revenue in China we anticipate in 2017 is somewhere around $2.6 billion. So for us having something that moves the needle for us has to be fairly sizeable. We are definitely deeply engaged with all of those companies and we look at 2018 and beyond as a much bigger opportunity.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks, Wes.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question from Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Your line is open.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the good execution. I wanted to return to the comments regarding reduced industry volatility because some of the majors we have for upstream semiconductor industry volatility show about a 75% reduction over the last five years versus the preceding 15 years. So it seems like for a company like Applied Materials, in that environment there should be certain parts of the business that benefit from increased operating efficiency. So the first part of the question would be are you seeing that and to what extent is that realized?","And the second part of the question is there should also be in that environment increased free cash flow predictability. And how does the company think about in a more stable environment, more seasonal environment, increasing systematic cash return or cash actions to create value? Thank you.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","So there are probably about three levels to that question: one, the volatility question; two was the benefits to the operating margins from volatility; and three, the benefits to cash returns.","So in terms of volatility, I completely agree with you. The volatility is trending down. Almost every metric we look at indicates that. The long-term metrics or the demand drivers for the industry are much more diverse and sustainable, and then layer on that you've got all these technology conversions. But I was just looking at some data today that the volatility is down, but within Applied it's down too because we are a much broader company. So I'll give you a couple of data points that I hadn't shared before.","So if you just look at our revenue split in semi in 2015, 2016, and 2017, our percent with memory has stayed pretty steady at 48%, 47%, 47%. And then our percent that's been foundry has ranged from 38% to 42%, and logic is 12% or 13%. So within device type, we're much stronger than we used to be. And we project in 2017 that our market share by device type, in NAND, DRAM, foundry, and logic, in all four of the major categories will be 21.5% or above, whereas we used to have a 10 to 15-point spread between some of our low memory ones and our high foundry. We've gotten a lot stronger in memory. So the volatility in the industry is down and the volatility within Applied is down a lot. And then you layer in the strength in the service business, which has grown a lot, and the display business, which has grown a lot, and it's sustainable. So I agree with you on the volatility.","Where will we see the benefits in the operating margin? We're going to see them in a few places. One, we will grow our revenue line and it will be more predictable, so that results in a few things. One, you tend to use factory utilization higher, so cost of goods sold, gross margins tend to trend up. So if you look at the benefits on gross margins, we are just grinding away on material costs and factory utilization, and that's helping us on these gross margins. As I said earlier in the call, we thought our gross margins would be up this year by 0.8 point to 44 points. We now think we're going to be up 1.5 points. And a lot of this is efficiency, grinding away, sustainability more predictable, less volatility, we talked about.","And then I said earlier on the call that we predict our operating margins in Q2 to be north of 27%. So we are seeing it in the numbers. The company is becoming more efficient, more effective with the products we're doing, but also with this less volatility is contributing. We are now, for instance, in our factories looking at being much more aggressive in what we ship in the first four weeks of a quarter to even more level-load our factories. So you're 100% right.","In terms of the benefits to the investors, we are starting to generate more significant cash returns. So if you look at the operating cash flow, it was 20% this quarter, which is very high for us in Q1. Last year Q1 was 9%, so we are doing it. Now the question is getting it back to investors. We are going to do it. We didn't do too much last quarter because of some \u2013 we were looking at foundry conditions around what's going to change in the tax laws, movement of cash between overseas and the U.S. But we see \u2013 one, we are committed to do it. Two, I think we'll have the flexibility to do it. And three, some of the changes that are being proposed in Washington may be beneficial to us in multiple ways, long-term tax going to a territorial system, we're on a worldwide system. So I think it's a great opportunity for the investors of Applied on this.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Craig, for the question. And, operator, I think we have time for just one more please.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our last question is from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks for taking my question. Your DRAM orders have bounced back to where it was a year ago. Obviously, you're gaining share there as well. But can you talk about what you expect bit growth-wise that that could translate into for DRAM? And do you share the view that DRAM suppliers are remaining disciplined in capital spending during the period where pricing is pretty good? Any color would be helpful. Thanks.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","I can start and Gary can jump in. I'll tell you what's encouraging for me in some of this stuff. If you look at NAND and DRAM \u2013 look at NAND, I'll look at DRAM in a second. We look at NAND bit growth in supply is pretty much in line and growing about 45% a year, and that's 45% over a bigger and bigger install base.","So the end-use demand for NAND is pretty damn strong. And DRAM is pretty similar. We see bit demand in 2016 up about 30%, and then we see server DRAM up about 40% to 45% in 2017. And supply has been a little tighter. We see 2017 supply bit growth is only about 25% to 30%, and then we see a lot of smartphone consumption up for new Android 6GB and Apple third-generation. But what's good for Applied is our market share within DRAM is up about 5 points from 2012 to 2015, and we think we're going to get another point in 2016.","So we think, one, the marketing demand for DRAM and NAND is growing pretty healthily. Two, it's growing pretty disciplined, more frankly. Even with NAND capacity additions, what we see is big demand drivers for more NAND. For instance, another factoid I don't think we gave you is that as solid-state drives become more and more cost-effective, there's probably going to be a need for up to about 500,000 more wafer starts greenfield to add capacity to what they have today. In other words, if you look in the world, there used to be about 1.4 million wafer starts for NAND. Now it might be 1.6 million wafer starts. But that's not even enough. Over the next four years, they probably have to add another 500,000 just for servers. Each 100,000 of NAND is worth about $5 billion. That's about $5 billion that they have to add to reach their growth in their markets.","So what's the point? Good growth drivers for NAND and DRAM, number one. Number two, pretty disciplined even with the capacity to do it on NAND because their market is expanding. Three, our position has gone up where we've gained by the time we're done in 2016 we'll probably have gained about seven points in both NAND and DRAM from 2012.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Okay, great. So thanks for that question. And then, Bob, if you'd like to, summarize it all before we close the call.","Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.","We talk about a lot of esoteric stuff here, bit growth and materials engineering. When I step back, even more than a few years ago, I think Applied has a really good business. If you look at the markets in which we compete are doing really well, better than they were years ago. Our position is much better. And as somebody answered on the call, our better execution and less volatility of the market is resulting in significant improvement in operating margin to cash flow. So we have a really good business. And what we're doing here is driving sustainable year-over-year growth in revenue, share, and profitabilities.","So the three things, as I would summarize again, is one, our markets are getting better, bigger, and less volatile. WFE and display are both strong with positive long-term outlook. We have strong share, as I said, in all device types. We were up in memory in particular. In foundry, we've always been strong. And then display is doing very well. And if you look at our service business, which was $2 billion back in 2013, we're going to hit $3.2 billion in 2019, so that's grown a lot, and that's a very strong baseline business.","Second, our execution is better. Our deep pipeline of products enabled by the product development engine, where 40% of our equipment revenue now is generated from products we've introduced in the last three years, we have multiple years of share gains. And what I don't think we mentioned on our call, we have record backlog of $5.5 billion at this point. So that's all around better execution.","And finally, the question I just got asked, billing, your return on cash is better than ever. Revenue is outpacing our markets. Operating margin is growing. As I said, we're going to be over 27% next year, and we have a great deal of flexibility to return more cash to shareholders. So I just think Applied has got a really good business when you cut through it. I feel really good about the business.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Great, okay. Hey, thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of our call is going to be available on the website beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials."],"3007":["Applied Materials, Inc.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike. With revenue and profits at all-time highs, I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials has now delivered earnings records for the past 5 quarters. We have tremendous momentum and a very positive outlook for the future. Our markets are growing with a broader set of demand drivers. Across a wide variety of industries, companies are making huge investment to drive transformative changes that shift economic value towards technology. At the very foundation of these emerging trends is Applied. And we are playing a larger and more valuable role advancing the innovation road maps in semiconductor and display. Our broad portfolio of technologies and businesses, combined with our strategy and investments, means that Applied has never been in a better position. This gives me confidence that we will continue to expand our available opportunity, gain share and outperform our markets. ","In today's call, I'll outline key industry trends as well as our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth. I'll then provide additional details about our markets and major businesses. Bob will then discuss how we're translating our broad portfolio of capabilities and products into differentiated performance for Applied. And after that, Dan will provide his initial impressions about our future opportunities as well as our outlook for the next quarter. ","I'll start with the backdrop for today's discussion. These are incredibly exciting times for Applied, and I strongly believe that we have more opportunities today than at any point in our history. There are 3 main reasons for this. First, our markets are strong and getting stronger. Pervasive demand for electronics means that our markets are getting larger and substantially less cyclical. New demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility. The Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence will transform industries over the coming years. In health care, transportation, manufacturing and retail, competition is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data and images. In these industries and many more, value is shifting towards semiconductors and displays. To realize the potential of IoT, Big Data and AI, major technology inflections are needed to advance the road maps in logic, memory and display. These inflections are enabled by materials innovation, and as the leader in materials engineering, Applied has a fundamental role to play. Second, Applied is better positioned than ever before. We've aligned the company around our innovation leadership strategy, and we've made significant investments to accelerate R&D. We have developed a strong portfolio of differentiated products, with more in the pipeline. It's the company's breadth and depth of products and capabilities that sets us apart from the competition. We have, by far, the largest exposure to industry inflections, and we're combining our skill sets in deposition, removal, materials modification, inspection and metrology to deliver innovative, new solutions. Third, we built a platform that gives us sustainable advantages over the long term. We've done this by strengthening our technical and management teams and putting in place a company-wide operating system, the product the management engine, that delivers repeatable success. Across the organization, I see stronger execution. Our product success rate is higher, we are transferring new technology to market faster and we're using our breadth more effectively. ","I'll now describe the major inflections and investments within our markets. In memory, near-term market fundamentals remain strong, driven by high-performance storage for data centers and increasing smartphone content to support new features, including 3D cameras. We expect healthy investment in memory to continue as the explosion of data storage requirements created by IoT, Big Data, AI and streaming video has only just begun. To keep up with demand, customers are aggressively pursuing their 3D NAND scaling road map, which has 4 major levers: increasing number of pairs, shrinking film and stack heights, multi-tier schemes and lateral scaling. All these approaches are enabled by advanced materials engineering and expand Applied's opportunity. ","In foundry, market dynamics are equally healthy. In the near term, we see capacity additions at trailing geometries to meet growing demand for sensors and IoT devices as well as strong investment in the leading edge. Looking ahead, advances in Artificial Intelligence are beginning to drive significant architectural changes, and customers are positioning themselves to win the major inflections in high-performance computing. In data centers designed for AI workloads, we see logic content growing at least twice as fast as memory. And as technology complexity increases, capital intensity is also growing about twice the rate of memory. ","In foundry logic and DRAM, dimensional scaling of devices remains a challenge, with 2 primary areas of focus: resolution and placement accuracy. New innovations in patterning are becoming increasingly important as customers move to advanced nodes. First, self-aligned multi-patterning techniques, SADP and SAQP, are needed in conjunction with EUV lithography to drive the resolution road map. Regardless of the rate of EUV adoption, we expect our opportunity in traditional multi-patterning to grow. Applied has great momentum in this market and has gained 16 points of shares since 2012. Second, new patterning approaches are being developed to address placement errors. As devices scale, the accuracy of vertical alignment between interconnect layers has a significant impact on performance and reliability. Placement errors cannot be addressed by advanced lithography alone and will require materials-enabled solutions. Applied has unique technology in this area, and we expect our opportunities to grow significantly over the next several nodes. ","Looking at the market as a whole, our outlook is incrementally more positive. We now believe that wafer fab equipment spending for the calendar year will be up 20% or more compared to 2016. We also expect 2018 spending to be higher than our current estimate for 2017. And in these forecasts, we made conservative estimates for spending in China. In addition, within wafer fab equipment, the ongoing shift to materials-enabled solutions in memory and logic opens up new opportunities for Applied. We now address 64% of the total market compared to 53% in 2012. Beyond semiconductor, our outlook for the display market has also strengthened. Display is growing even faster than wafer fab equipment as customers make multi-year investments to address large inflections in both TV and mobile. In TV, a major push to new Gen 10.5 substrates is other way. These huge, 10 square meters substrates are ideally suited for manufacturing larger format screens, 60 inches and bigger. We now expect [30] new Gen 10.5 factories to be built over the next several years. At the same time, mobile OLED investment is getting stronger as customers prepare for broad adoption of OLED in smartphones. oLED enables new form factors that result in a larger display area for smartphone, further expanding the overall market. ","I'll now provide brief updates for our major business groups. Our semiconductor leadership businesses, where we have strong market share and highly differentiated products, are having an outstanding year, fueled by investment in leading-edge foundry and expanding applications in memory. Demand for our PVD and CMP products is especially strong. We expect the PVD market to grow by around 45% in 2017 as foundry customers adopt new interconnect technology. And the CMP market is on track to grow 40% this year on top of 40% growth in 2016. Our CMP revenues were at an all-time high this quarter and on track to exceed $1 billion for the fiscal year. In our semiconductor growth businesses, we have great momentum in markets that are growing rapidly. Over the past several years, we have gained significant market share in both etch and CVD. Our combined etch and CVD revenues are at record levels, and we're in a great position to drive further growth. ","Service is an important part of Applied's portfolio that has grown significantly. This year, we're seeing acceleration of that growth. We delivered record performance this quarter, and for the year, we expect revenues to be up more than 15% over 2016. Demand for our Service Solutions is driven by our rapidly growing installed base, plus our customers' need to shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield and rapidly optimize their factory output and operating costs. We are investing to expand the services we offer, and we are confident in our ability to sustain our growth in this business. In display, as technologies and manufacturing are becoming more complex, Applied is in a unique position to enable the road map. This year, display revenues are on track to increase more than 50% over 2016, and based on our strong position, we expect to grow display at least another 30% in 2018. ","Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'll quickly summarize. Applied is executing well, setting new records, growing our available market and gaining market share. I would like to thank our employees for their passion to create value for customers and Applied. I'm confident that together, we will raise the bar further. Applied is in a great position, working at the sweet spot of major trends that will drive tremendous shifts in economic value over the coming years. Finally, our breadth and depth differentiate us from our competitors. We have wider exposure to major industry inflections, and we are bringing together the broadest skill sets and technology portfolio to create new solutions for our customers and accelerate innovation. ","Now let me hand the call over to Bob.","Robert Halliday","Thanks, Gary. Today, I'll add my comments about the business environment, describe how our capabilities and products are driving competitive and financial performance and invite Dan to share his perspective, along with our Q4 guidance. ","As you contemplate the markets, including record levels of demand for semiconductors and displays, I'd like you to note 3 things. First, I feel increasingly confident that our markets are becoming materially and sustainably larger. Gary explained the big picture, and I'll add some data regarding the near-term environment. ","In semiconductor, 2\/3 of NAND demand is driven by smartphones and SSDs. NAND demand for these devices is projected to grow by more than 40% in 2017 and 2018. Smartphones and service drive the majority of the DRAM market. And demand from these devices should be up by 30% or more in both 2017 and 2018. In foundry, our largest customer recently announced that its 7-nanometer tape-out expectations have nearly doubled. And we continue to see new investment at trailing geometries as well. So the largest drivers of WFP demand are strong. ","In display, OLED is quickly becoming the preferred technology for leading brands. Yet, the installed capacity supports less than 40% of the smartphone market. An increasing technical complexity in semi and display gives us a growing opportunity in services. In short, I expect sustainable growth for our markets and particularly for Applied. ","Second, Applied is uniquely well positioned in this improving environment, and we're driving growth and competitive performance across our markets. Applied has incredible breadth. And we're taking advantage of it across our semi and display businesses to help our customers solve their highest-value problems, with solutions based on unique combinations of our technologies. The investments we've made in our new product pipeline are already impacting the market. In 2017, we're delivering strong, double-digit revenue growth in every semiconductor device type. We project our share to be up for the sixth year in a row. And our share is balanced at greater than 22% across memory, logic and foundry. ","In patterning, we see continued growth and share gains because we're shipping newly designed products that address both line shrinks and edge placement errors. We've also put our services business on a growth trajectory, adding $1 billion in annualized revenues since 2013. And we built a unique and more diverse growth engine in display. In 2012 and 2013, our annual display revenue averaged $657 million. We expect to deliver a similar amount in the current quarter. Our display business is also becoming more profitable, and we're now targeting operating margins in the high 20s. So Applied has the broadest capability, largest served market opportunity and strongest new product pipeline of any company in the industry. ","Third, and perhaps best of all, Applied's innovation engine and operating discipline are driving higher profitability. The value that our technology brings to the industry is increasing, and that's reflected in our gross margin, which has grown by 5 points over the past 5 years. In Q3, our gross margin was the highest in 9 years. At the same time, we remain focused on expense control. In Q3, our non-GAAP OpEx-to-sales ratio was 17.9%, a record low. As a result, we delivered our first quarter with $1 billion in operating profit, and we had record cash from operations equal to 36% of revenue. ","Next, I'll comment on our Q3 performance on a year-over-year basis. We grew company revenue by 33% and non-GAAP gross margin by 2.9 points. We grew non-GAAP operating profit by 67% and increased non-GAAP operating margins by 5.9 points to a 16-year high of 28.7%. And we grew non-GAAP EPS by 72% to a record of $0.86 per share. ","Turning to the balance sheet. We grew cash and investments to $8.3 billion, and 40% was onshore. We repurchased 9 million shares of our stock and returned $482 million to shareholders, including dividends. ","Turning now to our segment performance on a year-over-year basis. We grew semiconductor systems revenue by 42% to a record $2.5 billion and grew non-GAAP property profit dollars to a record of $920 million. We grew services revenue by 20% to a record $786 million and increased non-GAAP operating profit dollars to a record of $215 million. We grew display revenue by 31% and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 2.6 points. ","In summary, I'm proud of the accomplishments of our teams, and I'm pleased with our top and bottom line growth. Applied's innovation engine is delivering sustainable momentum our profitable growth. ","Now I'll hand the call over to Dan.","Daniel Durn","Thanks, Bob and Gary and the entire team here at Applied Materials. You've given me a warm welcome and a great introduction to the technologies we're preparing to launch into a growing market for our products. I'm incredibly impressed by the depth of our technical talent. Applied has a world-class team, and I believe we can do anything we set our minds to. ","Gary and Bob talked about new advances in technology that are going to make dramatic change to our industries and to our lives. I saw this unfolding at my previous companies, and I'm excited to be here because these changes are enabled by semiconductors and displays, which begin with what we do at Applied Materials. I'll share more of my impressions about Applied at our Analyst Day in New York. ","One thing that's already clear to me as a financial person is that Applied has a tremendous portfolio. The leadership semi business, as Gary talked about, has some of the strongest product positions and profitability I've seen anywhere in this industry. The semiconductor growth businesses, as Gary mentioned, are dramatically outpacing their markets. Etch is up 5x over the past 5 years, growing at 2.5x the rate of the market, and that's just one example. Display is growing faster than semi, and we have technologies in the pipeline that will enable us to grow beyond what we can do in OLED smartphones and LCD TVs. And services are a great way to drive growth and diversify the company in areas that are particularly stable and cash-generative. Applied's portfolio is incredibly valuable. I'm excited to be a part of this team, and I'll use all of my energy to help drive Applied's innovation engine and growth. ","Now I'll provide our fourth quarter guidance. In Q4, we expect our overall revenue to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4 billion. The midpoint would be up nearly 19% year-over-year. We expect our semiconductor systems revenue to increase by about 14% year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow about 17% year-over-year, and display revenue should be up by about 48% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of about 46%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $685 million, plus or minus $10 million. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.94, the midpoint of which would be up by 36% year-over-year. ","To help you with your models for the calendar year, I'll share some of our early views on Q1 of fiscal 2018. We believe semiconductor systems revenue in Q1 is likely to be higher sequentially and higher year-over-year, and we believe our display revenue in Q1 is likely to be lower sequentially but higher year-over-year. ","Now I'll summarize by putting the company's guidance and momentum into context. In Q4, we expect the second highest semiconductor equipment revenue in our history, with continued double-digit growth momentum year-over-year. We also expect to set new record levels in services, display and for the company as a whole. We expect record earnings per share. We also look forward to another year of growth in 2018 based on strong customer pool across the portfolio as we supply our enabling technologies to drive the new data economy. I look forward to sharing our longer-term financial targets at the Analyst Day in New York September 27 and especially look forward to meeting many of you there. ","Now let me turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Dan. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.","Christopher Muse","I guess, biggest question here is sustainability in memory. And it looks like you're guiding [indiscernible] around $43 billion plus or minus this year. And roughly 70% of that looks like it's coming from NAND. And so curious, as you look at that part of the market, can you talk to your visibility to both greenfield and shrink plants as well as your thoughts around demand elasticity and how you're thinking about spend from that business over the next 5-plus years?","Gary Dickerson","Sure, I'll take a shot. Overall, we expect WFE in '18 -- I'll drill into the memory, too. We expect overall WFE in '18 to be up from '17. By device type, we think logic and DRAM should be higher next year. And we think foundry and NAND should both be strong next year. I think the 70% of total spend, the NAND, I thought you said, C.J., sounds a little high because we have NAND at less than 50% of total spend. But I'll drill into a bit deeper dive on what's going on in the memory markets. So let me talk about DRAM and NAND together, and I'll drill into NAND also. I think there's 3 important disturbance customers what about Applied in both NAND and DRAM. One, if you look at NAND rum customers, very profitable now, and I'll give you the numbers. Two, second thing to remember is demand is strong for both DRAM and NAND. Looks sustainable. The third thing is, actually, wafer starts additions have been modest, and I'll give you the numbers. ","And finally, think about the member that Applied Materials we've gained 8 points of WFE share in both DRAM and NAND over the last 4 years. So let me give you more specifics. In terms of customer profitability, which was the first talking point I made, DRAM WFE spending as a percentage of total EBITDA for our customers used to be about 26% on average. That's DRAM WFE spending, the total EBITDA. And we think that's going to go down about half, 14% this year and next. You know they're very profitable. When you look at the numbers, it's very profitable. The NAND similarly has gone down. Used to be about 26%. We did about 1\/3 this year or next to 19%. But that's also sustaining more higher growth rates in NAND, okay? The second thing to remember is bit demand. So if you look for smartphones and servers in both 2017 and '18, we see 30% bit growth demand. ","Now it goes down a point or 2 when you layer in PCs and start, but the big drivers are smartphones and service, and we see 30% bit growth demand or gigabytes. Second, and NAND bit demand, we see 40% growth rate in '17 and '18 each for smartphones and [indiscernible]. Then on capacity additions, if you look at the data over the last, basically, 5 years, and we see this year basically the same, NAND DRAM wafer capacity has been basically flat. They got some bit growth but because of their more layers, the actual wafers out of the building kind of goes down. So it's kind of flat, not a lot of capacity added. Then if you look at NAND capacity additions, you spend at the money but actually give as the visions have been somewhat modest, a couple of hundred thousand wafers up to 1.6 now. And we project that we need about 2 billion [indiscernible] years, 2 million, [indiscernible] wafer starts, 2 billion a couple of years after that. But if you look at the 3 big things, customers are very profitable in both DRAM and NAND. ","Secondly, bit growth and bit demand. Bit demand is still very healthy, and we see it next year, too. And three, actual wafer liver additions have been moderate. So we think I think NAND's pretty good for the foreseeable future.","Operator","The next button comes from Farhan Ahmad from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","Just quick clarifications. On the Jan quarter, do you think it will be a record level for SSD or not? And secondly, any color on the first half of next calendar year? Your commentary on 2018 seems to be fairly confident. Is it fair to say that the only things that you're seeing in 2018, they are looking pretty strong right now?","Gary Dickerson","Yes, it's strong. And we said in the call that Q1 was going to be a good fiscal quarter for us. So we said semi was going to be incrementally stronger than the comp. And display, not quite as strong as the comp in Q4 that we just guided to. So if you look at where we're close to reckon SSG this quarter, I think the record was last quarter, Q3. I think there's a pretty good chance that the record in Q1. Theres' a second question. Did you have a second part?","Farhan Ahmad","Yes, I was just -- calendar first year, is there any visibility that you have that makes you confident on the first half -- on the next year overall?","Gary Dickerson","What we said on the call, number one, was that we think next year, WFE is up. We also think our position's really good. And we have a strong degree of confidence in our fiscal Q1, and we don't see that problematic after that. We think it's a pretty good year.","Operator","The next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup.","Atif Malik","I just want to clarify the 30% year-over-year growth for display, is that for fiscal '18 or calendar '18?","Robert Halliday","Fiscal revenues. Calendar's good, too. I just don't a -- at that closer on the calendar basis.","Atif Malik","Okay. And can you help us out, how much of that is kind of market growth? I think, in the past, you've talked about an $18 billion display spending this year. Is that mostly market growth? Or are you baking in contributions from new products?","Robert Halliday","Yes. If you look at it in '17 and '18, our total revenues are going to be up in about 30%. If you go look at the market in '17, '18, it's going to be healthy. And our position's going to strengthen. And what the alluded to a little while ago that we're going to have some new product introductions. In fact, we already had 1 about a year or so ago. We're going to have more. So I think we'll get some contributions from the market and our position.","Operator","Your next button comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","You guys discussed the growing number of programs for large-screen LCD in your pipeline. A few weeks ago under earnings call, LG display discussed spending about KRW 20 trillion of bullet CapEx over the next 4 years. That's about USD 18 billion. And what actually for large-screen OLED? And I think the view is that OLED TV volume's going to grow from 2.5 million, 3 million next year to something like 6 million by 2020. Can you remind us on your position and large-screen OLED, your views on how you see the market evolving? Clearly, I think feel like it's been expect ever after mobile adoption.","Gary Dickerson","Sure. I'll give us some factoids on the overall market, which is touch on, Harlan, and a little bit on the OLED and then Gary might join on that one, too. So in terms of I do for you mentioned them, from our call, which, I think, was 3 months ago, our expectations for the total market of display equipment has gone up for all 5 years in our window, '17, '18, '19 and '20 and '21, all 5 have gone up. And we see strength across the board, basically, in both TV and mobile. A lot of big TV factories and increasing strength in mobile. So it's a very strong market position even more so than 3 months ago. In terms of our product positions, we're going to continue to traditional price. In terms of OLED TVs, kind of my stuff color filter I guess. So it's not the same OLED as you have in mobile, but it is a version of OLED. And our position is pretty good there. But it's not that big technology inflection, which is as much percentage growth in for everybody as you have some back in the mobile phones.","Gary Dickerson","We've been -- this is Gary. We've been increasing our share with pretty much all of the customers. And certainly, in this inflection also, we have an increasing position. So it's a very positive driver for us longer term. Relative to the inflections and kind of the market outlook, we're still in the early innings operating OLED mobile. So as that continues to get built out, that's a big positive driver for us. This adoption of larger screens in TV, we talked about the 13 Gen 10.5 factories, that will be built out over the next several years. And then if you look at the investments that large technology companies are making, VR, AR, automotive, those are -- there are other types of display technologies, portable displays, those other inflections that could be more significant if you look at it on the 3- to 5-year time frame. But we have good exposure to all of those changes.","Operator","Your next button comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar","I had a question on display. Something has been going on seeing the display CapEx is going to be down next year, but you guys are guiding to up 30% for revenue. And I understand you're getting some new products introductions. So a 2-part question. How much of the growth next year is driven by a new products versus the existing product line? And along the same path, can you split up of your revenue display revenue by LCD versus OLED for this year and next year?","Robert Halliday","Well, first, I'll do the market then I'll do a little bit on us. So with it of the total spending by display manufacturers is up this year and up again next year. We think it's pretty strong in both TV and mobile. So the big TVs are driving the CapEx spending on TV, and then mobile is mostly the OLED driver. So we see upside. In total, we see upside in TVs next year. And we also see some upside potential in mobile next year. And part of that is you see a proliferation to mobile phone display manufacturers beyond the big one in Korea. So if you think about the factoid we gave you over the last couple quarters, if you go back to our sales of OLED equipment in fiscal '16, roughly 2\/3 was to the biggest manufacturer of OLEDs. We've now proliferated to 10 different people buying some equipment from us. And the big guy, in terms of commitments of orders this year, fiscal '17, is significant less than 50%. So what you're seeing is next year can grow because TVs are good, and you have a proliferation of more people making the mobile phones.","Operator","The next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Gary, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on your view on China into 2018. You talked about having relatively conservative assumptions embedded in your WFE forecast for 2018. But what exactly are those assumptions? And what would be the bulk case over the next 12 to 18 months?","Gary Dickerson","Thanks for the question. China is one of our strongest regions in both semiconductor display. Our business is growing a significant amount. If you look at '17 versus '15, we're up 2x in semi, 50% growth in service and 50% in display. In '16 to '17, we anticipate we're going to be up more than 20% overall in China. We track all the projects. We have very close relationships and very high share in China. So we're talking on the projects for all of the customers. And we have leading indicators for the most likely investments. There's a lot of discussion about investment, but we qualify that based on these leading indicators. And based on all of that, 2018, we think, will be up an incremental at least $1 billion, probably in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2018. Longer term, we think that this number is going to continue to grow because of the strategic nature of the investment. In China, they're trying to grow the present domestic content, build a secure supply chain and it's a long-term strategy. The investments are not as efficient. Many of the investments next year will be in pilot plants in China, but we believe that this market will continue to grow over time, and our position is very, very strong in both semiconductor and display.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore","I want to ask about the growth in services. You talked about 15%, which is pretty good. I know you had a strategy operating kind of trying to move that opportunity. Can you talk about how you see is just because of the significant increase in the installed base tools versus some of the other things you might be doing to drive that growth?","Robert Halliday","Sure. If you look at it, you go back in a longer-term, historical perspective, we used to be kind of flat around $2 billion a year back around '13. This year, we're going to do about $3 billion. If you look at the rate of growth year-on-year, it's 15.9%. But if you look at the quarters of momentum picks up even throughout the year. So I'm pretty confident that the next year is a strong year for us, and probably the momentum is as strong, maybe a little better than this year for some reasons. One, if you look at your service business, it's a function of 2 things: the market, your position and your strategy to attack the market. 3 things, I guess. Market, product and session and strategy. So if you look at the market, WFE is pretty damn strong. It's a pretty big number this year and next year, so that provides a toolset that you can service.","Then if you look at a percentage of the market for us, we used to be 17.8% of WFE just for [300-millimeter] tools back in 2013. And this year -- last year, we grew, what, 22, and we're going to go up again this year. So to the bigger piece of the market. Thirdly, if we would gain a lot of share a lot of share of literature in place of entitlement for service. So all the dynamics are on the market, our position, the products we're selling is raising our service settlement. And then secondly, what we have done -- or thirdly, that was market and our position, thirdly, in terms of our strategy is improved more and more. So if you look at it instead of seeing parts and ad hoc labor, we are selling long-term service contracts. We talked about getting 1,000 extra service contracts per year. And that means we have a more predictable, more sustainable and greater value for the customers and ourselves that again raises our service entitlement. So my guess, the rate of growth and service business continue pretty strong next year.","Operator","The next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.","Romit Shah","It seems like the DRAM industry is at a crossroads here, whereby with the conversion to 1x, bit supply growth is going to decelerate into the teens range. And that's well below what people are thinking in terms of DRAM bit demand, call it, 25%, 30%. So it would seem like next year, we do see capacity increase. And I know you guys are positive in that segment for 2018. And I was hoping you could just share your assumption for capacity additions in DRAM.","Robert Halliday","I'll give you my opening, and then Gary can jump in. So if you look at the dynamics, 3 of our 4 big memory customers do both DRAM and NAND. I personally believe there's slightly different strategies in DRAM and NAND. If you look at NAND, like to see demand for NAND is probably pretty damn big. There's a lot of growth in NAND than [indiscernible] hard disk drives. Then if you look at spend there and grow their market and make a bunch of money. If you look at DRAM, I don't think quite as big. So -- and then if you look at shrinking, you nominally get 28% more bits, roughly, per wafer, but because there's partners to get this wafers out of the same building basically more steps, and that's what it comes in sort of 14% growth in kind of output of our factory. So it's getting expensive to keep growing effective bits.","So now what do you do? Well, if you have a total company strategy, you're probably going to invest heavily more heavily at a bit in greenfield NAND of visible marketing make money more heavily around conversions for DRAM. So what we see, our estimates is in 2017, you probably got about 75,000 wafer starts as in convert to 2.40 to 2.50. But the net adds is probably even a little less because it's like 50 or a little less because you kind of effectively shrinking your output that we could all those others because of more layer count. And we look at '18 similar numbers kind of 75 ads and convert 2 90 maybe. But it's more weighted to conversions than adds because of economics.","Operator","Your next button comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel.","Patrick Ho","Looking at the foundry market, clearly, you're benefiting right now from capital intensity trends going to the 10- and 7-nanometer node. But could you just discuss maybe how that node may develop over time? And could you see that node being potentially as large as the 28-nanometer node, which has been very profitable for the chipmakers? Is it possible that this is the next big node that we see and this could be a multiyear event for the foundry segment?","Robert Halliday","I think the answer is yes, yes, and yes, more than one-word answer. So if you look at [indiscernible] 28 NAND, where I think peaked out at 335,000 wafer starts, earlier in the year, about 9 months ago, our estimate 7-nanometer would peak out, it's kind of 10 going to 7, 7 call it would peak out really quickly said 2 50 then 2 60 -- then 2 80. We're currently at 300,000 wafer starts. Might the upside to that because what you get more and more applications for 7-nanometer devices. There's going to be all the typical process mobilephone stuff what they're going to get more and more into this cloud they're going to the cars probably 7-nanometer device. So probably go long and big, right? Sort of like 20-nanometer. Now the good news much of goodness 1 is big that's obvious. Two, it's kind of long. So then you start to roll 4, and you say, \"Hey, there's a lot of this roll to 5 stay at 7 of the product lines big now you stay at the Node 4 a while.","So additionally as much guess down to 5, right? The third thing, which is really interesting is if you look at capital intensity picking up from 28 to 7, you'd say, \"Well, okay, Bob, it's 3 35 to 300. You're down 10%.\" Capital intensity from 28 to 7-nanometer nodes is up over 90%. So to make those wafers, a lot more equipment sales and to our position's really good them is not to be a bunch of equipment sold it comes money big long note.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edwin Mok from Needham.","Edwin Mok","Just quickly on margin, two-part question. One, revenue said just marginally coming down actually the lower.","Robert Halliday","Edwin, could you repeat the question, please? I just couldn't hear it clearly.","Edwin Mok","Sure, no problem. So I guess, 2-part question on margin. First is service margin, I noticed it came down this quarter. Wondering what what's irreverent that? And then display, with the revenue increase in this quarter and you guys guiding for higher revenue, is it possible to display get to the city marginal level sometime in the future?","Robert Halliday","Okay. So first, I'll do service margins. Yes, operating margins. So there's the trendline, and they can pull up service that they get the data here. Q3, Q4. Yes. I think service growth and operating margins are up a little bit in Q3 and up more in Q4, actually. And our trendline is they're going to go up. So I think what you'll see, I'll give you some longer-term perspective and where we're going on that might help. We used to be 23%, 24% operating margins in service. And then in full year '16, we're probably 26.5 or 7. This year, the guide is like 28%, frankly, and we're going to trend up a little bit more. So our optima did end up gross margin trending up some, too. So I think generally, the trends but a good what's driving the trendline and margins? Revenue gross but it on good. Gross margins are coming up, and you got dropped to us to get the percentage gross margin and you get the leverage of the revenue growth. So I think operating margin's going to trend up in gross margins trend up as well.","Gary Dickerson","One other thing I would add in terms of service is we've really done a great job in driving lower cost. We're moving a lot more content into lower cost regions. And customers are also facing big challenges in the technology ramps for logic and also for memory. Our opportunity, Bob talked about earlier, in service contract is also increasing our revenue growth. So we're driving lower costs. We're driving greater value for customers. And that is increasing our overall operating margins and giving us momentum going forward in service business.","Robert Halliday","So then display. Display Edwin also operative margins and gross margins trending up. If you look at operating margins for display, from 2012, they're about 9.8%. '13 was 16 8. '14 is 24. About 25 in '15. '16 was about 20, 21, we're investing. This year will be about 26%. Next year should be up with the volume. So I think we're going to do pretty well in display. And now if you look at the longer-term model, which will show an Analyst Day, last year unless they model we showed that generally, our operating margins and gross margins are higher in semi, but services and display are both -- they're all increasing. And what you probably get is high 20s in service and display and higher 30-somethings in semi, and overall average goes up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc capital parts.","Weston Twigg","I just wanted to dig back into the visibility habits are large memory customers. And the reason I ask is just 6 to 9 months ago, your outlook for the year was substantially different. And so it implies very low visibility at some of these large customers. I'm wondering if that visibility has actually improved or you're really commenting on the trends are you're looking into 2018?","Robert Halliday","That's a heck of a good question. So I'll give you some historical perspective. We do forecast historically, based on -- we talk to the account guys with of the marketing guys, look at trend data and underlying drivers. When we do a kind of a 1-year forecast, it's a little bit more weighted to the start account guys. And the customers communication of second-half visibility to us is moderate. Sometimes they don't know, and sometimes they don't want to disclose it, frankly because it's a competitive issue for them. So my belief is that the semicap industry probably underestimated the second half of this year. And if we'd done a lot more deep thinking on it, we might have estimated at a little higher number than the second half.","And it is one particular customer much bigger than expectations. So if you go we spent me percent and included been a lot more time on root cause drivers, what not just what customers tell us, but what are they selling, what are you device go into what is the content of the phone, what is the content of the PC, what's the content of the cloud? So, for instance, if you look at the from, what we thought ended '16 was content, wasn't unit phones it's content of the phones, content of the cloud. That is continuing for this year. And if you say, what device type is up this year from early expectations? Across the board, but it's NAND, DRAM and foundry, but NAND probably the biggest increase one particular customer. So we're spending a lot more time going to root cause drivers of what's driving the NAND. So i probably have more confidence than I did a year ago about the outlook.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","I'm going to ask you to take another longer-term view on the end user is as you did with foundry, DRAM. And what I was hoping you could you do is just click out beyond the next few shrinks that we're likely to get to some of the alternative architectures. And the question is really around the equipment intensity that might be seeing with any of the successor architectures that would be there for DRAM. Is it higher? Is it lower? Is it a mix? What's the company seeing longer term for the extension to nonvolatile memory as we know it or volatile memory as we know it?","Robert Halliday","I'll start with more general stuff, and Gary will do the more technical stuff. I generally am optimistic about the industry and the various device types, but there's going to be granularity to some of that. So I believe that these drivers that this greater and greater valuable applications for silicon at the need to be basically, A, leverage on the fiscal assets and universe more efficiently through silicon. And two, I think a lot of the incremental consumption of entertainment meets health care will be leveraged by silicon. So I think the cosmic drivers, whether it's on automobiles, hotels, health care, you name it, silicon's going to play a big role in this. Okay? So that drivers now that said, how to make money in life is 2 ways: scale and differentiation.","So if you look at the scale of these things be a big increase scale up at the cloud with huge volumes. And the differentiations of these solutions what does that mean? I think you're going to have more different tape out some are different type of devices and you have before. I think you'll see the A6 chips. You'll see the graphics processor units at the guilty different types of high end, low end, different types of DRAM. And I think you'll see different types of memory. So I think the proliferation, more devices and more design, which is all good for us, frankly. And NAND, if you go to, but I think about altered memory? I think NAND is going to grow for a while. Hard disk drive. I think DRAM and memory was that segment the market the products because of volume of the differentiator so valuable that you can go to different design times. I don't think it's going to be one shoe fits all feat. And then thirdly, in terms of capital intensity, capital intensity by device type is up across the board from a few years ago, 30% to 90%, right? And I don't see that trend changing for all new devices either.","Gary Dickerson","So I would also agree with Bob that the -- you got big investments being made by leading companies to drive transformative changes that shift economic value in major industries. That's going to create a great opportunity for memory, for high-performance computing, all of those different areas. I also -- if you look at what's happened in memory over the last few years and what's driving the market today, tremendous innovation in architecture, driven by materials innovation, what we do better than anyone else. And we're working with very large companies on, certainly, extending current memory technologies, scaling 3D NAND. But we're also working on new memory technologies. And I really believe that the pace of innovation is going to accelerate. And really, at the foundation of that is Applied Materials with materials innovation. So I'm pretty optimistic on the overall market opportunity, and I'm also even more optimistic about our position to grow as these changes happen.","Operator","And next question comes from Jagadish Iyer with Summit Redstone Partners.","Jagadish Iyer","Gary, you talked about Gen 10 fabs in the display side. So I was wondering how is it often to be OLED. And as a bigger picture, is this large-scale transformation to OLED happens, are you going to see a new baseline to your display revenues?","Gary Dickerson","So the Gen 10.5 factories are really focused on TV and all of the [13] projects that we're tracking right now are not OLED factories. They're, again, large area. We're seeing an increase in terms of the area consumption for large screens. And it's way more efficient to go to these larger factories from a cost perspective. So that's what's driving that. I mean, certainly, we're certainly very optimistic about mobile OLED and the opportunities that we have there. We're still in the early innings. But the driver for Gen 10.5 is larger TV screens. Bob, if you want to add anything else?","Robert Halliday","Yes, I think that's true. I do think there's a hell of a lot the upper directional errors in general for the market. And so the new baseline revenue is increasing for display, which is one particular question, Jagdish. And if you look at the inflections, there's just as bigger TV I mind not just OLED a little those are really other infectious like simple phone you have now is you go to the wraparound to get up at the bottom of the you get 40% more surface area we sell service area whether it's layers are size. And I think you're going to have foldable in a few years, which doubles that service area over the phone or an iPod, I guess. And then eventually you going to have some OLED proliferation, as you mentioned, the [indiscernible] we're something further down the road. All of these lead to more spending now the question people would ask a year or 2 ago is, geewhiz historically, you might have $32 billion in WFE spending and $8 billion and display spending and shouldn't stay at 25%? No. Because the drivers are very different. I mean, display as you huge application across the world and TVs, mobile phones, everyone has and the layer account to increase in their visual content of that is doubling. So I think there potential is pretty big.","Operator","The next question comes from Toshi Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I had a question on gross margin heading into next fiscal year. Bob, you talked about display growing 30% year-over-year. I'm guessing, at least at this point, you don't have as high expeditions for the semiconductor business. Did you thank you can improve gross margins in the next fiscal year?","Robert Halliday","Our goal is to increase gross margins every year. I think this year we've done particularly well and going to be up a couple of points, almost 3. We're going to be up like 2.9 this year or something like that. We're up a lot, okay? And no that's a lot of things. I mean, I think we've executed [5] product across the line. So if you look at our gross margin, every single product and the company, every be even the company, which number between service and semi, like 13 businesses, every one of the gross margins is up from '13 to '17. So good execution. Mix this year is pretty good. It's a good semi pretty big display and services here. So my take there's an opportunity to grow up next year, but we haven't from the models. But it would be hard to do it as well as you do this year. So my average goal at the end is done through the numbers past average goal kind of [7x] of a point a year. And if we do anything like that, we're already kind of ahead of me '19 model. So I think there's still room.","Daniel Durn","Sure Mica cutting is probably good. Summarize a few key points from today's call. First, I hope you share excitement that Applied's markets are substantially larger and more attractive than they've been historically. We expect another record quarter in Q4. With that line of sight, the continued momentum in Q1 and far beyond. Second, Applied is uniquely positioned to outperform our core market, further building on our leadership in semis, growing the unique opportunity we have in front of us in display and expanding the service businesses. Last -- third, we're more profitable than we've been, and we have many levers to keep driving the profitable growth. And lastly, I look forward to meeting all of you in your current Analyst Day on the 27th. And personally, I can't wait to show you how we can to get raising the ceiling on our performance in the years to come. Mike, now back to you.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Dan.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Mike Sullivan, Head of Investor Relations at Applied Materials. We appreciate you joining us for our fourth quarter and fiscal year-end earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied's current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions, and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and are not guarantees of future performance.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. On November 10, Applied celebrated our 50th anniversary, and in this milestone year, we delivered all-time record performance, far exceeding our previous highs. In fiscal 2017, we grew revenues 34% and operating profit at more than twice that rate. I'd like to thank all our employees for making this a great year for Applied, and their passion for creating value for customers and shareholders.","It's Applied's breadth that sets us apart, and across the company, we are firing on all cylinders. We have tremendous momentum and our outlook is strengthening. I'm confident that in 2018, we can deliver strong double-digit growth across our semiconductor, display and service businesses.","Applied is working at the foundation of major technology trends and playing a larger and more valuable role in the electronics industry. Our vision is to make possible the technology shaping the future, and we've never been in a better position to do that.","In today's call, I'll talk about our markets and the large emerging trends that are driving sustainable growth in semiconductor and display. I'll describe how Applied is positioned, our strategy and how we're translating our broad portfolio of products and capabilities into differentiated performance for the company. Dan will then provide more details about our execution, financial performance and outlook.","Let me start by providing context. Our markets are strong and getting stronger, because there's a much broader set of demand drivers than in the past. In the annual war for leadership in the smartphone market, handset manufacturers are adding more and more functionality to their devices. IoT applications are expanding rapidly and data generation is exploding. Major inflections are taking place in the data center, and there's an emerging battle for leadership in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. And there is huge demand for new display technology, while at the same time, average screen sizes for both TVs and mobile devices are growing considerably.","A customer recently told me that this is the most exciting time in the history of the electronics industry, and I strongly agreed. We are at the start of a completely new wave of growth. The Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence have the potential to transform entire industries and create trillions of dollars of economic value.","As a result, we are seeing a broad spectrum of companies investing in AI-related technology. From transportation and health care to entertainment and retail, future success is dependent on capturing, storing, and understanding vast amounts of data. This is driving major innovations in sensors, memory, storage, and especially compute, which is key to turning raw data into valuable information.","Leading AI companies are telling us they need a step change in computing performance. This is driving a trend towards new highly-specialized architectures customized for AI workloads as well as much larger chips. Huge advancements in computing are taking place both in the cloud and at the edge. For applications where latency and security are important, like autonomous vehicles, natural language processing or safety systems, data will be processed and stored at the edge. This means more logic and memory content in edge devices, where power requirements are much more critical than in the cloud.","The AI architecture war is shaping up to be the biggest battle of our lifetimes and is going to be a major driver for the logic foundry road map. The winning architectures will provide large improvements in performance and power, and Applied is in a unique position to deliver the innovative materials needed to enable AI leadership.","I'll now translate these end-market trends into an outlook for our served markets. In memory, shipments are at record levels, and market dynamics remain very healthy. DRAM and NAND content in smartphones is growing considerably. For example, the average NAND content in entry-level phones has doubled from 32 gigabytes in 2016 to 64 gigabytes today.","Content is also growing in the data center, and the total cost of ownership of NAND-based solid-state drives is on track to cross over 10K hard disk drives in 2018, increasing the SSD opportunity to around 35% of the enterprise storage market.","Overall, bit demand growth remains strong, in a range of 20% to 25% for DRAM and greater than 40% for NAND. Our customers are making disciplined investments in both capacity and new technology to address the explosion of data generation and the need for high-performance memory to support emerging applications. And as the memory road map is enabled by materials innovation, this is very positive for Applied.","In foundry, we see strong demand at the leading edge, driven by next-generation mobile devices, automotive and high-performance computing. We're also seeing significant investment in trailing geometries, especially for image sensors. This is driven by the adoption of dual cameras in smartphones as well as IoT devices, including public safety systems.","Looking ahead, we expect the emerging battle for leadership in AI and high-performance computing to be a major driver for the 7- and 5-nanometer nodes. Increasing investment in China is additive to overall wafer fab equipment and especially good for Applied, since we have very high share in this market. We now see total spending in China being around $2 billion higher in 2018 compared to 2017, with more significant growth to come over the next several years.","Bringing all of this together, our outlook for wafer fab equipment spending has strengthened since our Analyst Meeting in September. We now believe combined investment in 2017 and 2018 will be several billion dollars above our prior forecast of $90 billion and that 2018 will be larger than this year.","This positive market environment increases our confidence that we will sustain our growth momentum in 2018 and make meaningful progress towards our 2020 financial model. Applied has never been in a better position than we are today, thanks to the breadth of our capabilities and product portfolio. Our breadth not only gives us by far the largest exposure to industry inflections, it also is creating strong pull for earlier and deeper collaborations with customers.","In these customer engagements, we are combining our unique capabilities to create new materials with our innovative technologies in materials removal, materials modification and e-beam inspection and metrology to deliver new integrated solutions.","Our breadth also provides us with speed advantages. Speed of innovation is more important than ever for our customers, and bringing new devices to market faster is tremendously valuable. Because we bring together the most enabling capabilities in one place, we can help customers to develop winning devices faster and more effectively.","To strengthen customer collaborations that are made in technology center and in their labs, we recently aligned the organization to better connect our broad capabilities across the company. We also increased our R&D investment by more than $230 million in 2017.","In semiconductor, our process equipment businesses, that provide materials engineering solutions, grew about 40% in fiscal 2017; and our inspection and metrology business grew at around 20%, delivering all-time record revenues. This was an especially strong year for our PVD, CMP and thermal products, driven by the mass adoption of advanced interconnects in logic as well as increasing use of logic-like processes in memory.","We also made strong gains in patterning and 3D NAND, and we're in a great position to grow in DRAM, as customers transition to new higher-performance devices over the next several years.","As we look ahead, we see customers increasing their focus on innovative materials and structures to drive the major advances in transistor and interconnect needed to enable high-performance computing in AI. As a result, there is increasingly strong pull for our leadership products that improve performance and power efficiency of leading-edge devices.","In service, our momentum is accelerating as we introduce new ways to deliver value to customers. We delivered record performance in 2017, with fourth quarter revenues up 20% compared to the same period last year. In 2017, the fastest-growing business in our portfolio was display, with revenue growth of 57% year-on-year. Due to the physical size of display equipment, lead times are much longer than in semiconductor, and that gives us extended visibility. We expect 2018 and 2019 will be very strong.","In our last earnings call, we said 2018 display revenue would be up more than 30% versus 2017. Our view for 2018 is now even more positive, and we see revenue growth exceeding our previous estimates.","Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Fiscal 2017 was a record-breaking year for the company. We have great momentum, and we're confident that in 2018, we can deliver strong double-digit growth across our semiconductor, display and service businesses. This is underpinned by sustainable strength in our markets. As new demand drivers layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, AI will transform industries over the coming years, and Applied plays a fundamental role creating the materials that enable the next-generation of memory and high-performance computing. In addition, Applied is uniquely positioned to drive differentiated performance, thanks to the breadth of our portfolio of products and capabilities.","Now, Dan will give his perspective on our execution and outlook.","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. Let me start by saying that the semiconductor industry is more exciting today than it's been in many years. This is absolutely the perfect environment for Applied Materials, because we're the biggest, broadest and most capable company in delivering leading-edge process technology to our customers.","The future Gary described needs an order of magnitude improvement in processing performance and in performance per watt, plus geometric cost reductions in solid-state storage, the future is not going to happen with the same chips and chip-making methods that got us to where we are today.","Shrinking isn't enough anymore. We also need breakthroughs in materials, materials engineering, which is why we're so focused on disruptive products, new material combinations and rapid learning. For me personally, it's been an amazing and eye-opening three months. So much of what the semiconductor industry does begins with Applied Materials. The talent and the technology inside this company are second to none, and we're going to play a huge role in enabling the new AI era of computing.","Now, I'll talk about what we're focusing on and how we're executing as a company. First, we're focused on making sure we're putting our R&D dollars to work in the right areas, to create and enable the inflections, and to grow in those inflections. We're also focused on being disciplined execution machine we need to be, to satisfy our customers and investors and keep increasing our profitability and shareholder returns.","Since it's the end of our fiscal year, I'll summarize how we're doing across the major parts of our portfolio. As I outlined at the Analyst Day in New York, our Semiconductor Systems group has a wide range of product lines that can be summarized in two areas; leadership and high growth.","In leadership semi, we have unique, strong share of businesses that enable high-performance, low-power transistors and interconnects. Our team is focused on expanding our reach beyond logic and foundry, because DRAM and NAND chips also need to be faster and consume less power. This is increasingly true in both AI workloads and cloud data centers.","Within memory, our leadership semi businesses were up 45% year-over-year. Over the past four years, they've grown by a factor of four in memory, contributing an additional $1.5 billion in revenue growth and 2.5 points of our company's share gain in memory over that same time period.","I'll share some of the applications that are driving this great performance. When NAND moved to 3D, our epi technology was adopted to increase read and write speeds. Today, in DRAM, the control circuitry is adopting advanced logic structures, to increase data access performance and reduce power consumption. This is driving more demand for our PVD, implant and thermal technologies.","The second area of our Semiconductor Systems group are high-growth semi businesses, are about cost-effective 2D and 3D scaling. Our teams have been extending our wins in 3D NAND to new wins in 2D scaling. The old patterning steps are being replaced with new techniques, including self-aligned multi-patterning and EUV. Applied is growing and gaining share in these areas, because we introduced new platforms, including Sym3 and Selectra.","The greatest challenge in advance patterning is aligning the features between the critical layers. We are solving this challenge with new materials-based alignment techniques, along with EB measurement and inspection. As a result, our patterning share is growing by four points year-over-year, and our Imaging and Process Control group generated its highest revenue ever.","Our services business is about helping our customers to manage the increasing process complexity and generate high returns in an era of higher capital intensity. This year, we drove a 25% increase in tools under comprehensive service agreements. The agreements enable us to generate more value by helping our customers get to yield faster, and maintain higher yields and lower operating costs over the life of each node. We grew our services business by 17% this year to a record $3 billion, and plan to keep growing at a 15% compound rate through 2020.","Our display business is about bigger and better TVs, along with mobile displays that are thinner, lighter and better looking than ever. The team has done an excellent job in ramping a new generation of our tools for Gen 10.5 display factories. Gen 10.5 substrates are 80% larger and will allow customers to make the leap to affordable 65-inch and 75-inch TVs.","In mobile, our team established the leading position in thin-film encapsulation, which enables OLED smartphones that are now the hottest selling products of the leading brands. We grew the display business to a record $1.9 billion this year.","While the business units are generating product wins and strong revenue growth, the manufacturing and support organizations are also executing well. Our manufacturing teams are delivering 1.4 times the volume of prior-year years, and at the same time, they've reduced cycle times while improving our overall quality metrics. Going forward, we will keep a sharp focus on further improving our operational performance, cost structure and continuing to drive spending discipline.","Now, I'll share our financial performance. We're pleased to report that in Q4, we delivered strong year-over-year growth across the company. In Semiconductor Systems, we grew revenue by 14% and non-GAAP operating profit by 19%.","In services, we increased both revenue and non-GAAP operating profit by 20%. And in display, we grew revenue by 50% and non-GAAP operating profit by 109%. Applied as a whole delivered record revenue and earnings in Q4, landing near the high-end of our guidance range.","Our 2017 fiscal year was our best ever. We grew revenue by 34% to a new record level. We increased non-GAAP gross margin by 2.9 points. We reduced non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue by 3.2 points. We increased non-GAAP operating profit by 6.2 points, and grew non-GAAP EPS by 86% to a record $3.25.","All of this resulted in record operating cash flow of $3.6 billion, equal to 25% of revenue. We paid $430 million in cash dividends, and we used $1.2 billion to repurchase 28 million shares of common stock at an average price of $42.08.","Now, I'll turn to our outlook. Looking ahead to 2018 and 2019, one word leaps to mind, sustainability. Our markets are sustainably strong and our momentum is sustainably strong.","Gary mentioned that wafer fab equipment is going to be comfortably above $90 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. We believe WFE will remain sustainably higher and more stable than in the past. There are three strong reasons for this. First, unit demand is growing. Second, capital intensity is higher. And lastly, our customers are very healthy, and making sound investments to generate profitable growth in the next wave of computing, which will take a decade or more to fully build out.","In fact, the markets for chips and displays are both fundamentally strong. And that's great for Applied Materials, as the company with the most growth levers in our space. We enable better smartphones and TVs, and we power the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence, which together, are creating a new data economy","At the Analyst Day, Gary showed that Applied now captures 1% of all of the spending in the electronics industry and that our share has doubled in the past four years alone. In January, Gary and I are attending the Consumer Electronics show to meet with investors and explain how we'll continue to grow the company by enabling these major trends shaping how we live our lives.","In today's earnings release, we included a table detailing our year-end backlog. It gives you a better sense of the year we just had, and more importantly, our momentum going into 2018.","In 2017, Applied generated record orders of $16.1 billion, and we ended the year with a record backlog of over $6 billion and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11. Our backlog entering 2018 is large and broad-based; in semi, it's $3 billion; in services, it's $1.1 billion; and in display, $1.85 billion.","In 2018, we anticipate that each of our segments will grow faster than the rate needed to achieve our 2020 model on schedule. So, we're off to a great start executing to the target model we discussed at our recent Analyst Day in New York.","Now, I'll share our guidance. In Q1, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.2 billion, the midpoint would be up nearly 25% year-over-year. We expect our Semiconductor Systems revenue to increase by about 32% year-over-year. We expect our services revenue to grow about 17% year-over-year, but will be lower sequentially, which is normal seasonality due to the customer production schedules during the holiday season.","We expect our display revenue to increase by about 6% year-over-year. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be about 46.6%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $715 million, plus or minus $10 million. This amount includes holiday shutdown savings of nearly $10 million. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.98, plus or minus $0.04. The midpoint of our range is up nearly 46% year-over-year.","Lastly, because it's the beginning of a new year, I wanted to offer you some help with your models. Gross margins for full-year 2018 are likely to be near our guidance level for Q1. We remain laser-focused on gross margin improvements across our businesses, and some of our progress is likely to be masked by a rapid growth in display throughout the year.","Our display outlook is stronger. And while Q1 display revenue and operating margin will be lower sequentially, we expect both to be higher in the balance of the year. We recently increased our display operating margin goal to the high-20s. And our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to be around 10%. I hope this additional color helps with your models.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. Now to help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please poll the operator and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let's please begin.","Unverified Participant","Good afternoon.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from C. J. Muse from Evercore.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you for taking my question. I guess my question centers around the operating margin targets. And you're hovering around 29% here and you're targeting a 2020 model of 29.6%. And I guess, thinking about the growth dynamics that you've outlined, as well as the fact that you need to obviously continue to invest in R&D, we'd love to hear kind of the push and pull that you see ahead? And would you agree that perhaps your target model is a bit conservative? Would love to hear your thoughts around that. Thank you.","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, C. J. The company has made great progress over the last four years on margins. From a gross margin standpoint, the company has added about 1 point per year over that time period. If you looked at our operating margins, since 2013, we've added over 14 points to our operating margins. The company is performing and executing incredibly well.","If we look at the way the company is compressing discretionary spend and funneling more resources to R&D, it's what's leading to the rapid organic growth that the company is delivering. Gary is incredibly focused, inflection-driven organic grower and we're going to continue to execute against that strategy.","So company has made good progress historically, will continue to make progress. You'll see operating leverage in the model going forward, and we're going to be looking for additional opportunities to improve margins beyond the target model and beyond the guidance that we gave on both the gross margin and operating margin lines. And we'll deliver that to shareholders when we find those opportunities to execute on. So, we're really confident and we've done a great job historically and we'll continue to execute well.","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yeah. One other thing, C. J., I would add, as Dan talked about on the call, we're off to a great start. So, if you look at the model we talked about just a couple of months ago, and the data that we provided in the call today, we're going to be well along the way towards that financial model for 2020. Certainly, we're not going to update anything this soon, but we're off to a really great start.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, C. J.","Operator","And your next question comes from Atif Malik from Citigroup.","Atif Malik - Citi Research","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on great results. Gary, if you can just qualitatively talk about what's driving the upside to the $90 billion number WFE that you shared at your Analyst Day, which end-markets are looking better? Is it the image sensors? Is it domestic China? And similarly, on the display side, is it TVs or is it more OLED that's driving higher than 30% year-over-year growth? Thank you.","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Atif. This is Dan. Let me jump in. 2017 was a record year for the industry. At our Analyst Day, we said 2017, 2018 combined would be $90 billion. Gary, in his prepared comments, said several billion more than that, and we see the fundamentals into 2019 being strong as well.","As we take a look at what's driving this level of activity, I'd put it into three buckets. First, demand drivers; second, capital intensity; third, our customers are very healthy. From a demand drivers standpoint, we're layering in additional layers of end-market demand, things like artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, big data, autonomous driving. We still have significant content gains to go in the handset and we're seeing significant demand for solid state drives.","So, as we look across the industry, the demand drivers are multiple and broad-based. And as we take a look at how that translates to activity within our industry, each of the device types is showing strength. Capital intensity is up across the industry. In foundry, it's up 100% over the last handful of years. And in that same time period, NAND is up 60% and DRAM is up 40%.","And customers, they're investing a lot, but they're making a lot of money. The level of investment, as a percentage of their profitability, EBITDA, is down over the last five years in memory, it's down 40%; in foundry and logic, it's down 50%. So, the ecosystem customers are healthy and will continue to invest and generate returns on that investment.","As we look at the industry and where we're at, at the very highest level, I would say there is strong balance between foundry logic and memory, with maybe a slight weighting towards memory. And within memory, we see NAND about two-thirds of that market and DRAM about a third.","In foundry logic, we see foundry about two-thirds and logic about one-third. And in 2018, we see that same or similar profile that we're seeing in 2017. So, we think that the upside is broad-based. We see NAND up, we see logic up, we see foundry strong, we see DRAM strong. So, we're pretty happy with the fundamentals through 2018 and into 2019.","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yeah, I'll answer the question on display. Basically, two big drivers for display. One is TVs and the other is mobile OLED.","In the large screen televisions, we have 13 factories that we're tracking that are Gen 10.5. And a data point for that is, if you're building 65-inch television with Gen 10.5, large panels, you can get eight TVs; if you're building then with Gen 8.5, you get three. So, as the consumers are going to larger screens, there is a compelling value proposition to move to Gen 10.5. So that's driving part of the market. And then of course, for smartphones, OLED is a big factor.","And what we see through 2020 in mobile OLED, with the investment that's being made, you'll be able to build about 50%, right around 50% of smartphones with OLED screens in that timeframe. So those are the two drivers; large screen televisions and mobile OLEDs.","The mix relative to revenue, 2017 is more weighted to mobile versus TV. The mix in 2018 is pretty balanced between TV and mobile. But, again, both cases, we see these as multiyear drivers for display. And as we mention in the prepared remarks, we have a long lead times for display, and we see display healthy 2018 and 2019.","The other thing I'd mention about display is, it is unique for Applied Materials; in expanding our materials innovation into this market, the complexities increasing and it really has been a great growth driver for the company.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Atif.","Operator","And your next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, congratulations on the solid execution and the outlook. Last earnings call, you guys articulated a view that total DRAM capacity has been relatively flattish over the past five years. And looking into next year, DRAM bit demand looks actually quite strong, you guys articulated some of that on the call. And it would argue for some growth in the installed base capacity in 2018. I think you guys also said last call that it's looking like maybe 75k growth and 50k net add of capacity to the total installed base at DRAM.","So I guess the question is, has that view changed? Because we've heard of some potentially new greenfield DRAM programs. And the point here is we just want to make sure that from your perspective, capacity growth outlook still looks relatively disciplined for this segment of WFE market?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Harlan. I think the short answer is yes, we still see a very disciplined market. We've got healthy customers, and the market is being demand-led. We see about 25% bit demand growth, and we see a very disciplined add of incremental bit capacity to match that bit demand growth. So, we see overall a very healthy market. We see the market being demand-led, customers are healthy, making money, so we're encouraged by what we see.","I think the news this year for us, the interesting news, is we increasingly see in the memory market adoption of power and performance capabilities in the memory devices, and we see it in both DRAM and NAND, which means our leadership businesses, as I said my prepared comments, are showing strong growth into the memory market going forward, higher input\/output feeds. And the logic periphery that sits around memory cells and DRAM are increasingly adopting logic-like power and performance capabilities. So, we're really encouraged by what we see in this market.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results. I had a question on your display margins. And I guess, this quarter, I was positively surprised by the huge up-tick in operating margins in the segment. So, I guess, the question is, what drove that? Was it something one-time or was it simply a function of revenue, or was there something more sustainable and fundamental behind the big up-tick? And going forward, how should we think about margins in display as you start to ramp your new products and as you expand your SAM? Thank you.","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Toshiya. Yeah. So, I would look at the scale of the business getting larger, the continual improvements. We put out a target for this business of being high-20s, and that's what I would look to longer-term out of this business. I think you'll see it profiled differently into Q1 and get stronger throughout next year. But the way to think about this business is high-20s operating margin. We'll obviously look for opportunities to do better, but I think that's the right place to look at.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Toshiya.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on good results. I had a two-part question, I want to ask both upfront. One is, I think, Dan, you articulated the DRAM supply demand, wondering if you can articulate a similar one for NAND in 2018, if you think demand bit growth will exceed supply bit growth for NAND?","And the second part question is that, I completely agree with you on the sustainability of WFE, but that question always comes up every now and then with investors. And if you believe 40-plus-billion or $45 billion is the new norm for WFE, why wouldn't you increase the dividend to reflect that so that it will put some of these questions to rest? Thank you.","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Krish. From the NAND supply demand standpoint, I think we see bit demand growing 40% in 2017, we see it higher into 2018. As you take a look at the capacity adds, today, we've got 1.6 million wafer starts per month of installed capacity, half of that is converted to 3D NAND. We still have half of that installed base to go to convert. And so, we see maybe 1.8 million to 2 million wafer starts per month in the 2020, 2021 timeframe.","So that market looks demand-led and healthy as well. We see lot of room to go for solid-state drives. We are in the very early innings of penetration of solid-state drives. Handsets still have lots of content gains to go.","As you take a look at the 3D roadmaps going forward, 48 layers, 64 layers, all the way up to 144 layers, the roadmap extends beyond several generations. And incremental NAND bit growth in the era of 3D NAND is more challenging. So, all of this comes together to give us confidence that we've got a balanced market, opportunity is there, and see demand in this market being fairly elastic. So, we feel really good about what we see.","From a capital allocation dividend perspective, so this company has had a long history and tradition of returning excess cash to shareholders. In the last five years, it's been 82%. In the last three years, it's been 89%. And we're going to continue to return cash to shareholders. As you take a look at the tax structure and the proportion of cash that gets generated overseas versus onshore, there is a structural impediment to us being more aggressive from a dividend perspective in the near-term, but this is something that gets a lot of \u2013 we're spending a lot of time discussing this and we're watching tax policy out of Washington very closely.","And when we get clarity on tax policy, then we'll be able to determine what the right long-term proportion of dividend versus share repurchase is, so that where we continue to return cash to shareholders in the most efficient optimal way possible to drive value for shareholders.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thank, Krish","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","And your next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Yes, thanks. I just wanted to kind of piggyback on C. J's question about margins. Dan, you laid out what we felt was conservative gross margin expectations at the Analyst Meeting, 47% in 2020. And according to your plans for this year, it looks like you'll get pretty close, 46.6%. And you alluded on the call at least that you think over time, maybe you could do better. So, my question is really how high is the ceiling for gross margin?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Romit. I think we'll stand by our model that we put forward at our Analyst Day in 2020. We'll update that model at our next Analyst Day to the extent there will be new news. And in the meantime, the company is going to be hyper-focused on driving strong execution going forward, continuing to look for every opportunity we can to squeeze profitability out of this company and drive value for shareholders. We're off to a good start.","If we were to take the current 2017 mix and apply it to the cost structure in 2017 \u2013 I mean, I'm sorry, the cost structure in 2020, the 47% target gross margin would be over 48%. So, the progress that we're making as a company, to some extent, will be masked as display and services outgrows our semi business. But we like having multiple drivers of growth. We like our breadth, and it just gives us more opportunities to impact this industry in a really positive way, creating value for shareholders.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Romit.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","That's terrific. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. One very simple question on \u2013 from the level of CapEx that you're seeing currently in NAND and DRAM, what level of bit growth do you expect on the supply-side for next year?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","So, DRAM, we see about 25% bit growth from a supply perspective. And I would say about 40% to 45% from a NAND perspective.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. The WFE number keeps going up. And we were at 34 billion not that long ago. Now, you're talking about a number, it sounds like well north of 45 billion for next year. Is it the level where you start to think that we're going to level off or will decline, that \u2013 because it seems like the ceiling on supply isn't changing even though the WFE number is rising a lot. And is that \u2013 did you guys underestimate how expensive this would be to add that amount of capacity or just why you're so comfortable when you talk about this being sustainable out to 2019, when the WFE number has grown by so much?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Joe. I think when we look at what makes the industry healthy where it is today, again, it's diversity of demand drivers, supporting macro trends that are going to unlock significant economic value. Capital intensity is up across the board, customers are investing. But again, they're healthy and profitable. And the industry never went to 450-millimeter wafers.","And so for a variety of reasons, we feel very, very good about where we sit. Is there opportunity for upside of this levels, if I had to take an over\/under on WFE, I'd say over right now. But it's probably premature to see that. And again, we see the market being demand-led. And when you take a look at things like bid output per dollar invested, that growth is slower. And so, it just accrues benefit to companies that are in our business, and Applied is better positioned than any to capitalize on it.","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yeah, maybe let me add something on kind of where we're at. We went from PC enterprise \u2013 everybody has long memories of waiting for the operating system upgrades \u2013 to mobile and social media, pervasive demand, annual war every holiday season for all of the consumer electronics products. And now we're moving into this AI big data era.","And many people talk about their opportunities to create trillions of dollars of economic value, transforming transportation, health care, many major industries. So if you look at what's happened over the last couple of years, the components of that are data generation, data storage and compute.","So, data generation, you have all of these smart devices and sensors that are growing very fast. And over the last period of time here, you now have foundry, 40% of foundry spending is in the trailing geometries. And all of these smart devices are continuing to grow, and there's tremendous economic value that's created there. So that's one driver that wasn't there in the past. Then all of this data is going up at a very high rate. We showed at the Investor Meeting that memory shipments are tracking data generation, and as Dan talked about, memory has never been healthier in terms of overall profitability. There's a tremendous increase in data, capturing all of that information. And then to really transform those industries, trillions of dollars of economic value, you have to process the data. And at the Investor Meeting, we talked about oil powering the industrial revolution, data powering the AI, big data revolution.","And so, again, you have the trailing geometries, you have the leading geometries and the war for the AI architectures on high-performance computing. You have drivers on the memory, the data storage and the cross-over for solid-state drives. So a number of different things that are new drivers.","The other thing I would add, it's \u2013 some small incremental add is China. We talked about China being up in 2018 in the wafer fab equipment spending by about $2 billion. And what we see is that we believe that that investment will continue to go higher in China, not step function change, but incrementally higher going forward in the future. So, you have all of those drivers kind of underpinning where we're at right now. And certainly, we were able to talk about 2018 double-digit growth across all of our different businesses, because we have better visibility to customers and all of those drivers and all of their projects. So that also gives us increased confidence.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Edwin Mok from Needham.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the service side of the business. You guys \u2013 obviously, you guys have done a great job, just grew 20% year-over-year. As we go through 2018, given that it's growing above what you guys have targeted, this 15% target you talked about. Is there a risk that since you signed all these big contract now that there may be a slower growth rate as we go through 2018? And you mentioned that you have 25% increase in service contract, is there a way to kind of think about how much of your installed base is in service contract versus how much more room you can grow?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","So, I think over the last several years, we've been growing service contracts net over 1,000 (48:47) per year. And as we talked about, the revenue opportunity for us is dramatically higher when we have the service contracts versus no service contracts. So there was a big change in strategy around 2013. And since then, the service contract growth has been pretty significant.","So, if you look at what's happening with customers, they're ramping many of these new devices. 3D NAND going to 64 layers and 96 layers, and in the future, they'll be ramping 1Z (49:21) DRAM and 7-nanometer in foundry and logic. These technology nodes are very difficult. And we've reorganized service, so we're focused on being able to support our customers in accelerating yield, output and cost. And we have tremendous traction for customers. It's worth a lot of money for them to optimize those big investments they're making in their fabs. We've made changes within the organization, so that we're accelerating those new service products and we have very high confidence that we're going to continue to drive the service around a 15% rate.","In the last year, as we mentioned, it's been faster than that. But the number that we discussed at the Investor Meeting, we still have high confidence in is around 15% in terms of the compound annual growth rate.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Edwin.","Operator","And your next question comes from Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe for Gary, in terms of your positioning, you talked about in the past that share gains you made in areas like etch, process control, and you gave some more color today about areas like patterning. As we look at 2018, and especially with China growing as a percentage of WFE spending, how do you see those share gains moving forward, say, in both 2018 and maybe over the next few years?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Patrick. So, if you look \u2013 if you include this year, over the last six years, we've gained share five out of the last six years and we were flat one year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we are anticipating double-digit \u2013 strong double-digit growth in both our leadership and high-growth semiconductor businesses. So, pretty broad-based.","We have very good momentum in memory. We've gained several points of market share in memory over the last several years. Dan talked about the significant growth that we've had, not only in the high-growth semi, but in the leadership products where we have extremely high market shares, we've grown in the last few years about $1.5 billion, I think is the number, in additional revenue growth.","And we see, as Dan talked about, in memory, moving to more logic-like structure. So, all of those leadership products where we have very, very high share in foundry and logic, we're growing significantly our share in memory also. So, that gives us a one driver.","In patterning, we also have gained significant share over the last five years. We've gained about 19 points of share in patterning. And what we showed at the Investor Meeting was another $1 billion growth over the next four years in patterning. And we have, again, tremendous momentum there.","In foundry, as this war for AI leadership is happening, we are creating the materials that enable power and performance. It's a very unique position. And that is leveraging all of our leadership businesses, all of those areas where we have externally high share. The power and performance for high-performance computing is coming from Applied Materials.","And in China, we talked about $2 billion in growth in China. We have very high share in China. We will outgrow that market growth. It's going to be a fair amount of growth. I don't want to give a specific number, but it's a significant amount of growth for us in China in 2018.","And then the last thing I would say that we're really driving that a bigger emphasis in the company is around connectivity. It's worth a lot of money, it's worth a lot money for our customers to accelerate a new device to market. If you can bring a winning AI chip to market six months or 12 months faster, that's worth a lot of money.","So, we are creating the materials that enable power and performance. We have innovative technologies and modifying materials, we're moving materials and analyzing materials. We recently made a change in the organization to better drive speed of innovation and especially connectivity across the company. We have very strong pull from our leading customers across the board, real strong pull on new materials, new innovative materials. And we're the only place where you can work all of that at the same time.","So, this focus on connectivity is stronger than we've ever had at Applied, and the pull from customers for connectivity is also very strong. Again, if I can accelerate a chip to market by 12 months, it's worth a tremendous amount of money. We've put a tremendous amount of talent into that organization and that's another driver in terms of our business going forward.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick.","Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tom Diffely from D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.","You talked a little bit about the increase in OpEx sequentially. And first, I assume that's mainly just in the R&D line. And then what should we expect from a sequential increase in OpEx going forward?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","So, when we look at OpEx, again, the company's done a great job investing for growth. Almost all of the OpEx that you see, virtually all of it, is to support R&D programs that drive growth and continue to build out our field force, as we bring new innovative products to market, engage with our customers and drive the right kind of outcomes for the customers. So, it's clearly to support growth, new inflections and building up the field force to bring innovative products to market.","As we think about the profile throughout the year, I think you could see, we're going to be up into Q2, and then a little bit into the back-half of the year and flat for the back-half of the year. So, you'll see that grow a little bit throughout the year.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. And operator, we have time for just two more questions, please.","Operator","Okay. And your next question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. I have a more near-term question, a few companies has suggested that the first half of next year, foundry will be slightly weaker. Do you agree with that? And if you look at the 7-nanometer ramp that those companies think will be as big as the 28-nanometer node, if this is being spread over say four years and we're halfway through that, does that mean the next two years, we're also looking at kind of flattish foundry spending, just trying to get some color around your comment that foundry spending will be strong next year?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Sidney. Again, as we look at 2017, shaping up to be a record year for this industry, as we look at how we are going to close out the calendar year, in November and December, we see significant strength in our business rounding out the calendar year. As we look at the slope throughout 2018, we're confident and encouraged by what we see strength throughout the year. And the fundamentals, again, look good into 2019. So, we feel really good about where we sit and how things are going to profile.","From a foundry perspective, we do see the 7-nanometer node being on par with 28-nanometer. Our estimation, given the spend that we see on the lagging edge, is 28-nanometer is still going to grow. Initially, we thought it was going to land around 320,000 wafer starts per month. But we do see that growing.","And when you combine that with 22-nanometer optical shrinks off of 28-nanometer, you're going to get something that tips over 400,000 wafer starts per month. And when you look at 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer, we see something that's going to be on par with what we just said.","How it gets profiled, we think 7-nanometer is going to be large, and we also think 5-nanometer is going to be large as well. So when we look at foundry being strong on a go-forward basis, we really like what we see in terms of up-tick in demand and the diversification of those demand drivers.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Sidney.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your last question comes from Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on very strong execution. Gary, I wanted to go back to some of your comments both in the prepared remarks and in some of the questions around AI. This week an industry event NVIDIA's CEO said that, up to 70% of all data center workloads could be AI-enabled. And so the question is, as you're talking to your customers about the pressure this is putting on their capital investment, are you hearing that this is a gradual force through 10-, 7- and 5-nanometer, or did they see a step function coming at any one of those nodes or more of an investment in either logic or memory, where there are diversified suppliers? Thank you.","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the question. And again, what we're seeing is, if you look at the data generation, already, we see a big impact in terms of wafer fab equipment spending in sensors, in those trailing-edge geometries, smart everything. We see about 40% of foundry spending coming from those sources, and we think that's going to continue.","And then the increase in data, again, you have to capture the data before you can process it and create the value, we're certainly seeing tremendous increase in data that's driving a healthier memory business than we've ever seen.","And for the high-performance computing, the key thing about Applied Materials is that we create the materials that enable high-performance computing. Our leadership business, if you look at EPI and PVD and implant and the advanced annealing processes, all of those areas we have very, very high market share. So, the pull that we have with customers is tremendous.","The visibility that we have around those structures for 7-nanometers, for 5-nanometers is very unique in that we have that's we are creating those materials. So the pull for us is very, very strong.","And the architecture war that's happening in AI isn't over. There is a lot of companies that are designing specific AI chips for different kinds of applications. So there's a tremendous amount of activity there. And we think that that will ramp a significant amount over time.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks. Craig. And Dan, would like to add anything in closing?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks Mike. If I could \u2013 I want to say that this is incredible exciting time for me, our company and the industry as a whole. Applied is a unique position and our breadth sets us apart. It allows us to drive the most inflections and it generate the most growth opportunities. The company is executing extremely well. We're delivering record performance. But we're not going to be satisfied. We're not going to rest on what we did last quarter or last year. We're going to be relentlessly focused at driving execution.","We're going to continue to make smart R&D investments to drive our organic growth. We're going to continuously improve our operations. We're going to look for more ways to increase gross margins, deliver more value to our shareholders and we're going to continually drive spend discipline throughout all levels of this company.","This execution is delivering great momentum for us. We're ending the year with record backlog and record orders in the year. We're going to expect double-digit growth across all of our businesses going into 2018. Personally, I look forward to seeing many of you, Credit Suisse, in a week-and-a-half, at CES to start the New Year.","And I guess, lastly, for those of you who call Boston home, please make sure you give a warm Boston welcome to our friends from the Golden State when they rolled into town tonight for what is going to be an amazing game.","With that, I wanted to thank you for joining us today and giving us your support. Thank you.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today.

We hope to see many of you at the event and we'll also provide a webcast and replay for anyone who won't be able to join us in person.","So with that introduction, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter.","Michael R. Splinter","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon everyone on the call today. I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered another quarter of solid financial results, posting $2.5 billion of revenue and earnings at the high-end of our target range. These results reflect strength in our semiconductor equipment business, driven by robust foundry spending. Investments in areas related to advanced transistors are particularly strong, enabling our front-end products and implant groups to achieve record quarterly sales.","In contrast, the environment for our Display and Solar businesses remains weak, as television sales continue to be sluggish and solar market adjusts to excess manufacturing capacity. We recently announced the details of our EES restructuring plan. The actions we are taking are consistent with our previously stated goal to reduce the annual breakeven level for EES to approximately $500 million. Our success in driving operational improvements across the company has bolstered our confidence in our ability to deliver strong cash flow performance throughout our business cycles. As a result, in March we announced the 13% increase in our quarterly dividend and a new stock repurchase program authorizing up to $3 billion of buybacks in the next 3 years.","Let me now turn to the economic outlook. While a number of indicators point towards stronger growth of our global economy in the second half of the year, we remain mindful of the consumer spending implications resulting from macroeconomic risks in Europe and the emerging markets. Mobility is the prominent macro theme impacting Applied's business as it drives significant changes in consumer behavior, including faster adoption rates for new products and shorter refresh cycles. Global appetite for mobile devices with new features, longer battery life and brighter, higher resolution displays continues to strengthen. We now see smartphone sales in the range of 660 million to 710 million units for the calendar year and maintain our view that tablets will grow approximately 60% year-on-year to more than 100 million units.","As these devices drive demand for leading-edge foundry capacity, the market leaders are aggressively accelerating their ramps at advanced nodes. Foundry investment has contributed almost 60% of our revenue in the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2012.","Over the past 2 years, seasonal buying patterns have become more pronounced, as the foundries need capacity and production that supports smartphone model changes later in the year. We see their equipment spending peaking in the second quarter. And despite the uptick in Q2, we believe foundry investment will be maintained in the second half of 2012 and distributed over a broader base of customers.","Unit growth of smartphones and tablets is also driving demand for NAND. However, the average content per box remains relatively flat. We believe bit growth will be about 75% for the year, with approximately 1\/3 of investment representing new capacity additions and 2\/3 technology conversions. This is resulting in softening of spending in the near term. With hard disk drives supply issues now resolved, global PC sales are recovering. DRAM bit growth is in the 30% to 40% range and process equipment investment remains at historic lows. However, we believe ultrabooks and Windows 8 will have a positive impact on logic and memory spending starting in late 2012.","Across the industry, factory utilization rates and wafer starts are steadily increasing, and this is reflected in revenue growth for our services business. As a result of sustained investment by the foundries, we are narrowing our wafer fab equipment forecast. We currently see spending in the range of $32 billion to $35 billion or flat to down 10% compared to 2011, with a relatively even split between the first half and second half of the year.","A favorable spending mix also contributes to our positive outlook for fiscal 2012. As foundries introduce advanced transistors schemes at 28-nanometer node, the number of selected epitaxy and ion implantation steps is growing. Applied's market leadership in epi and implant resulted in record quarterly revenues for these businesses. Our metal depositions group also posted its highest quarterly sales in more than a decade, reflecting the increased complexity in PVD for metal gate structures.","We expect continued strength from these product lines as transistor formation becomes more process-intensive at the 20-nanometer node. The Varian integration is progressing to plan. We are pleased with our customers' response to the acquisition. We are on track to exceed our target synergy savings. As we integrate the 2 companies, we're deploying several members of the Varian management team to roles in other business units and functions.","In Display, near-term orders are being supported by mobility applications, as high-resolution mobile displays migrate from smartphones to tablets and as touch panel manufacturers add capacity in anticipation of touch-enabled Ultrabooks. While investment in TV capacity remains at low levels, we see a number of indications that the market is improving. With panel prices increasing and factory utilization trending higher, and as customers start to build out new factories in China, we expect TV-related orders to pick up as early as the fourth quarter.","In addition, the adoption of metal oxide transistors is accelerating. This technology increases the served available market for Applied's deposition equipment by about approximately 30%. And we expect this to have a positive impact on revenues in 2013.","In solar, our view of the end market has not changed materially since March. Germany remains the leading consumer of PV and has once again delayed their feed-in tariff reduction. Demand in China, the U.S. and Japan is also accelerating. Marginal efficiencies are steadily rising. And as manufacturing cost continue to fall, we are starting to see the economics of solar working even in non-incentive markets.","Investment in new capacity remains at extremely low levels, despite the top panel makers in China, and Taiwan running their factories at high utilization, and noncompetitive capacity being taken offline. While we remain confident in the long-term potential of the EES business, we are scaling back our development program for LED equipment, consolidating administrative and support functions in our solar business units and moving manufacturing for our wafering products in Asia. These actions will improve profitability across cycles, while still allowing us to invest in the products that are critical enablers for our customers and for long-term growth of the business.","In summary, 2012 can be characterized as another strong year of wafer fabrication equipment spending. Applied is delivering the solutions our customers need to meet their aggressive capacity ramps and rapid transition trends to new technology and volume production.","Now let me hand the call over to George for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?","George S. Davis","Thank you, Mike, and let me add my welcome to everyone on the call today. During the second fiscal quarter, we exceeded our expectations for revenue and delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27 at the high-end of our target range of $0.20 to $0.28 per share. Strong performance in our semiconductor equipment business was the largest contributor to these results. Our Solar and Display businesses continue to focus on next-generation technology, while managing their overall spending in the face of weak markets.","As Mike indicated, after the end of the quarter, we announced the restructuring of our EES business to lower the cost structure and the operating breakeven level. We expect to incur charges of $70 million to $100 million for costs relating to employee severance, inventory write-downs and other asset impairments over the next 12 to 18 months. These costs represent approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share on a GAAP basis and up to $0.01 per share on a non-GAAP basis. We will keep you updated as these charges impact our financial statements.","I'll now compare our second quarter results to the prior quarter. Orders increased 38% to $2.8 billion and net sales increased 16% to $2.5 billion, led by strong demand for semiconductor equipment. Backlog grew 10% to $2.4 billion, in line with orders. Backlog adjustments were a negative $24 million, as cancellations, financial debookings and foreign exchange impacts of just under $100 million were partially offset by $73 million of re-bookings, primarily in Display. Our backlog aging remains healthy, with over 80% of backlog expected to turn in the next 2 quarters.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.1%, up 1.4 points sequentially, reflecting a higher mix of SSG revenue. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $580 million, slightly above our target range of $565 million, plus or minus $10 million. We expect to be in line with our target range for the current quarter.","Spending on SSG programs continues to increase in line with a rapid acceleration of technology adoption and the early work on 450-millimeter. Overall, we are seeing some benefit of early synergy capture. We expect the impact of further synergies and our broader EES actions to bring operating expenses to the lower end of our target range over the next several quarters.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9% and for the fiscal year, the rate expectation remains at 26% to 27%.","Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3.2 billion, up $289 million. Operating cash flow was $603 million or 24% of revenue, driven by higher earnings and a reduction in working capital. Improved inventory and payables more than offset increases in receivables associated with higher net sales.","Our capital allocation priorities continue to be investing in attractive opportunities in our core businesses, increasing the dividend in line with the growth of the business and utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash. In addition to increasing our dividend and setting a new 3-year repurchase program in the quarter, we paid $104 million in dividends and spent $200 million to purchase 16.2 million shares. At current price levels, we continue -- we expect to continue to be an active buyer of our stock.","Next, I will comment on our signal results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were up 39% to $2 billion, reflecting continuing strong foundry demand. Net sales increased 32% to $1.8 billion, above the upper end of our outlook. Customer concentration remained high with the top 3 customers representing 72% of orders and 68% of revenue. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin increased to 32.3% on higher revenue, with improved earnings flow-through more than offsetting spending increases for new programs.","In AGS, orders grew 26% to $650 million. Excluding a thin-film solar line booked in the period, orders would have been 7% higher compared to the prior quarter. AGS net sales were up 3% to $551 million, slightly below our outlook due to the timing of some 200-millimeter equipment shipments. Non-GAAP operating margins declined slightly to 20.1%.","In Display, orders increased to $84 million, driven by advanced mobile display investments. Net sales for Display were up 29% to $134 million and above our outlook due to earlier-than-anticipated tool sign-offs. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.7%. Display has maintained its spending discipline and will remain profitable in a challenging environment.","In EES, orders increased $29 million to $62 million, reflecting very low levels of demand. Net sales declined to $79 million. EES had a non-GAAP operating loss of $57 million on lower revenue and a $20 million inventory charge.","Next, I will talk about our expectations for the third quarter. We expect SSG net sales to be down 5% to 10%. This decrease follows a stronger-than-expected second quarter. In AGS, we expect net sales to be flat to up 10%, driven primarily by improving wafer starts.","In Display and EES, we believe net sales will be in the range of flat to plus or minus 20%, with both operating from a low base. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to down 10% and we expect our non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.29 per share. This estimate includes a non-GAAP charge of up to $0.01 per share for the EES restructuring actions.","For the fiscal year, the company expects net sales and earnings per share to be at the high-end of the company's previous outlook, which estimated net sales in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.5 billion, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.95.","Now Mike, let's open the call for questions","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, George. [Operator Instructions] Holly, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar, Credit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, it sounds like you said that the year is likely to be flattish for WFE and you've taken up, at least, the low end of your WFE outlook. But you also said that Q2 may be a peak for foundries and you think memory is likely to remain weak. Could you just give a sense of the moving parts between first half and second half? What's sort of coming up to make it flat in the second half?","Michael R. Splinter","Sure. So I think first of all, to kind of understand our view on this, you have to think about -- what the foundries need to supply model changes and the buying season at the end of the year. So what it does is peaks out foundry spending in this kind of second calendar quarter, end of the first quarter, beginning of the second calendar quarter. Now, since if you look at both our fiscal year in the very beginning of the calendar year, spending in wafer fab equipment was a little bit weak. So as you go through the -- when we add it up, we get pretty much flat first half, second half, even though we see a peak in this time period of March, April, May. Then if you we at the other kind of segments of wafer fab equipment spending, in the DRAM area, we expect low levels of spending throughout the year, modestly down in the second half of the year. NAND spending, we previously had thought it would be better, but we now think it's not going to be better. It's going to be a little bit lower in the second half of the year as well. And then we do expect logic spending to perk up at the very end of the year as new tech -- the next node of logic technology starts to be purchased. So the summation of that is foundry will end up being pretty flat first half, second half; logic will pickup; and memory will be modestly down in the second half.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. One quick follow-up. If I take a step back from the seasonal trends in foundries and all that, if I look at how big this 40-nanometer node is at all the foundries, and if I look at how much capacity is being added at 28 nanometer, and if I sort of try to think about the capacity at the end of the year, relative to how big the opportunity is, do you think that we are labeling the 28-nanometer additions or later links or early links? How do you sort of think about the overall opportunity for 28 additions?","Michael R. Splinter","Our view on 28 is that this is going to be the largest node. We think demand on 28-nanometers is very high and there's still constrained supply. The speed of the ramp is about something in the neighborhood of 50% faster than the 40-nanometer, 45-nanometer ramp. And we think in the end, when this -- when 28-nanometer peaks out over the next few years, it will end up being something on a range of 40% higher than the previous generation peak. So right now, we think 28-nanometer is going to be strong through the year. It's going to be strong into 2013. Assuming that our customers can find a place to put equipment, they'll continue to add equipment as quickly as they can.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions. First in the EES segment, what does normalized profitability have to get to over the next couple of years, post the restructuring in order for you guys to want to stay in the business? That would be the first question. Second question is on the NAND side, obviously it's been a little lower than we all would have thought this year. Is it just pricing that we need to look at in order to determine when that segment could pick back up, or is there some technology transitions coming along that could create a need for increased spending, even in the absence of a pickup in pricing?","George S. Davis","Jim, it's George. I'll the question on the EES segment. I think if you look at the new EES model that we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we showed that operating margins went to somewhere between 16% and 19% when we to get to a $1 billion of revenue, which is about half of the run rate that we saw last year. So we think as EES moves up into that range, it starts to show the underlying benefit of the core operating businesses. It continues to be an investment vehicle for us. We think this is an attractive long-term business and so we'll continue to invest in next-generation cell technologies. But we think in that range, it will be a positive contributor to the company.","Michael R. Splinter","So Jim, I think you got both a question and a follow-up. But the NAND follow-up question, what we're seeing right now is about a 75% bit growth. But within that, there's a number of things, maybe I can address first supply and then demand. On the supply side, we're seeing a number of things happening here. A lot of the legacy demand is kind of falling off for things like cameras, iPods or MP3 players, and USB drives. So that allows them room to upgrade their legacy capacity, so factor one. Then additionally, the 3-bit per cell technology is getting qualified in many more applications and much faster, probably, than we thought it would. On the demand side, I think the biggest factor is that the footprint in tablets and smartphones of NAND flash is not moving up as fast as we thought. So while they're affected by that big growth rate of 60% in tablets and 30-plus percent in smartphones, they're not getting a big additional kicker on the bit growth because the number of bits per box are staying relatively flat. I think that part of that is pricing, but I think part of it is just what consumers demand for storage in these devices. So until solid-state drives get into PCs or the footprint dramatically changes, I think we'll see this kind of growth rate, bit growth, in NAND.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin, UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question on the 2012 sales guidance being at the higher-end at $9.5 billion. Do you have an updated view on the Silicon group sales guidance for the fiscal year? Can we assume that the Silicon sales will be at the higher end of the range given at Analyst Day?","George S. Davis","Yes, I think the pick up that we're seeing in our outlook is driven by SSG, so that's where we're getting the additional benefit.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up question is do you think you could achieve the 24% target market share gain goal at foundry customers faster than you originally thought, given the strength you're seeing there now?","Michael R. Splinter","I don't know about faster than we're thinking. I think we have to see some more transistors move the gate last to be able to see that, and some more gains in our etch and PD -- in our Inspection business to be able to reach that goal. But we're encouraged by the gains in the front end at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria, RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mike, in perspective of 28-nanometer capacity constraint, can you tell us, are you getting a longer lead time because it seems like that your revenue is going down but your orders are pretty high. Is that the customers are slotting for a longer period of time with you because of the capacity constraints?","Michael R. Splinter","I think that customers have recently realized how constrained the capacity is, so we have a way of doing business and for them to signal as soon as they know where they're going to need capacity. I wouldn't say that they're giving us a lot more lead time. I think they're telling us as soon as they know that they need more capacity. In part, you can see that here in our Q2, where demand was a bit higher in our semiconductor group than we thought it would be. And I think that actually is extending into Q3. So I don't know that we get anymore lead time on this. But we would like to get more lead time but the way this business is working right now, I think customers let us know as soon as they know.","George S. Davis","And with some of our customers, the time between order and shipment is pretty tight. And so we had another quarter of pretty high turns, which also makes it hard to make the math work when you look at the high orders in this quarter and the lower orders, but still very strong demand.","Michael R. Splinter","It is good to see the backlog inch up a bit, though, I will say that.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And one more thing if you can elaborate on the foundry side, I think you said the first half was very concentrated. And did you say that you're seeing some broadening from the foundry -- in terms of foundry customers in the second half?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes, I think that's fair to say. But when you really look at this, there are 4 major foundry spenders, and it's really a matter of the mix between those 4 major foundry spenders; who's spending more, who's spending less. I think the second half will be a little bit more even than the first half.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok, Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Actually a question on the Display side. You mentioned on the prepared remarks that you expect fourth quarter to pick up. Just to clarify, is that calendar or fiscal? And in terms of pickup, what is driving that? Is that new model changes or just channel demand?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes. So we said by our fourth fiscal quarter, we said as early as our fourth fiscal quarter, but the biggest thing that we continue to see some increase investment in mobility, for tablets and for touch-enabled ultrabooks. But also to really have the orders pick up, we have to see TV investments increase. And that, particularly, will be in some factories in China. The factories are built, and it's a matter of customers deciding when to facilitize those. But we think that could be as early as fourth quarter. There's been pretty significant underinvestment this year, CapEx as low as $3 billion. Our equipment CapEx as low as $3 billion. So very significant underinvestment here. Meanwhile the market is growing, so the shortages are improving, prices are improving. Supply and demand is getting more in balance. So we think that there is needed investment and as we projected in Analyst Day, we think 2013 can kind of get back to 2011 revenue levels for us.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","That was very helpful there. And then going back to silicon, just I guess a question on foundry. I think one of the foundry, or at least one of the foundry or some of the foundries, are starting to talk about 20-nanometer as the new node and I think some people are speculating that will be a bigger node and if you listen to what Intel is talking about in terms of 20-nanometer, it's seeing basically bigger [indiscernible] because you need more equipment. So are you guys anticipating that to start to come in calendar fourth quarter of this year? And do you expect that to be, I guess, a longer-term driver for the foundry business?","Michael R. Splinter","Certainly, we do expect 20-nanometer to again be a very big node for the foundries. We'll see some R&D equipment, but we don't expect a major ramp in 20 nanometers in the fourth quarter. Really, what we expect is logic spending to increase at the end of the year as 14-nanometer capacity starts to get built. Both of those technologies are quite good for Applied as the advanced transistors take a lot more steps. They'll take more epi steps. They will take more metal steps to be able to develop those high-performance low-power transistors.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Blansett, JPMorgan.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Quick question on the second half as you diversify out your customer base in SSG. Should we expect a modest improvement in the margin profile when this occurs?","George S. Davis","It will be -- I think, more impact on the margin will be just the activities we're taking on cost. So it'll be modestly positive, but not material.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Then the follow-up was tied to the disclosure that you're going to significantly reduce your spending on the LED front. Does this mean you're out of the area or are you just trying to kind of minimize the development expenses at this time for maybe a longer burn before you get some product?","Michael R. Splinter","So what we're going to do there is certainly we have a number of customers that we've been working with. We'll continue to support those customers in their efforts to get our products into production. But we're going to pull back on how much we've been spending on the new capabilities and the new products in the MOCVD area. So we will pretty significantly pullback on the spending there. And really, the rationale is we have a lot of areas that we are looking at that have good return for the company and for shareholders and we have to prioritize our spending. And this is one of those areas where the return looked quite far out, so we made our choices to spend in other areas and also cut back and get our profitability in our Solar business up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen Citigroup.","Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Wenge Yang for Terence. In terms of DRAM spending, as the DRAM price stabilize, is there any discussion from the customers to resume some of the technical -- technology shrinks for the DRAM sector?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes. Technology shrinks are ongoing. The DRAM guys have had -- primarily, where they're spending their small capital budget is on technology shrinks. But we've been encouraged to see prices stabilize here. I think it's certainly a sign that capacity and demand are getting more in balance there, as we all know there is some capacity coming off line here at the current time, which also should help that balance. But people are not talking about new factories yet at this point, or new big capacity adds.","Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just a quick follow-up on that. Last time, when [indiscernible] merging to Micron camp [ph], there was a technology spending to convert the processes from [indiscernible] process to Micron processes. So in this round, if Elpida and Micron deal went through, do you see another round of technology spendings to consolidate the process into a single process backlog?","Michael R. Splinter","I really think it's too early to tell exactly how Elpida and Micron are going to get together. I'd just say we're encouraged that the factories are still running and Elpida is getting orders from major customers. I think those things are positive signs right now. How far down the road, certainly, eventually, they have to synergize the technologies, but that may not be needed for a while because the spec DRAM cells are relatively similar.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Shankar, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mike or George, one is a long-term question, with all the well-publicized supply-side issues stated by the fabless companies. Do you think down the road, these fabless guys that are well capitalized might start buying front-end tools from consignment and place it at the foundries, kind of like what they do at the back and the tester of the OSAT?","George S. Davis","I think it's a great long-term question. I don't think we would have any visibility to that trend starting now. And again, I think what you're seeing with foundry customers is a desire to add capacity to meet future demand and across a broad group of customers. So I think the model as it stands right now is still on the horizon.","Michael R. Splinter","But certainly people are concerned about not having enough supply at this node. So I think it will be interesting to see what strategic actions they take for the next node of capacity.","George S. Davis","Well, one of the challenges is how do you -- you'd have to be a customer that had tremendous scale. Because factories today are only going to get more scale intensive. So there's probably only 1 or 2 customers, and maybe 3 actually, that have that kind of scale and 2 are already fairly engaged in production.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just my follow up, along the same path. It seems like the foundry players are spending for yield and demand. So in a scenario of the macro economy deteriorates in the second half, in your view, do you think the foundry players continue to invest for whatever reasons they want to do it in the second half or do you think they'll scale back in the second half of the year?","Michael R. Splinter","I think it really depends on what the demand on smartphones and tablets are. These things seem to transcend some of the economic environment, but it depends on how bad a situation we can imagine. Certainly, if there's a situation like 2008, I think everybody pulls back like they did in 2008. But I think with any kind of modest pullback, there's a good chance that these electronic devices continue to be sold in nearly these kind of quantities that we're talking about.","George S. Davis","And we're starting to PCs pickup, which is a positive sign and certainly we didn't get much help from PCs last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you go back for a second in terms of just trying to reconcile the revenue outlook that you're presenting for July versus I guess the strong order flow you've seen over the last 2 quarters. You mentioned turns business continues to be high. I guess is that any indicator for us to look at how orders are or what's the discrepancy? How can I reconcile the strong order flow that we've seen versus the revenue guidance for July?","George S. Davis","Well, I mean, I think we discussed the SSG element, which is a high degree of turns business that we saw in the second quarter. Also, remember we had a large, close to $100 million booking in AGS related to a SunFab project and that won't actually revenue until after the third quarter. So that may be part of what, if you're trying to reconcile, that may be part of the math.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And also, a second question in terms of the margin profile on a going forward basis. You mentioned a lot of the gains you hope to get on the margin profile from the cost savings efforts. As revenues begin to grow again to what I would characterize as more normalized levels, how much does just the impact of increasing revenues contribute it to say the gross margin, more particularly?","George S. Davis","Well, I think you're already going to see it. In the third quarter, we said we'd be down on revenue. I think we're going to be fairly flat on gross margin as some of the improvements help offset the effect of volumes. So one of the things in margin that is the big factor is going to be mix. And as we get -- continue to see a strong semi mix, while we're -- particularly while we're seeing the non-semi business is still at absolute levels, we still have some room for upside. But really it's when the non-semi businesses start to recover, which we expect to happen in '13, that I think you're going to see some real lift on the margin side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah, Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","George, I'm just trying to understand the bookings profile that you reported in the second quarter. Some of your competitors reported a much lower bookings number in March quarter. I'm just trying to understand is it just timing, or is it exposure to certain set of customers or lack of exposure in Japan or is it the share gains?","George S. Davis","Yes, I think it's -- I'd love to say it's a little bit of all of it, but the fact is we also had an additional month, which was an important month in terms of demand. It's a month that'll be in our competitors' next quarter and it won't be in ours. But we had very, very strong, particularly foundry orders in the second quarter, and that really was the foundation. In addition, as I said in AGS, we're above trend in orders because we had the one large project order that skews the data a little bit.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one of your foundry customers recently pulled in 20-nanometer CapEx, are you seeing similar activity at some of your foundry customers? Are they asking you more for 20-nanometer? And do you expect maybe some of those customers to similarly follow the big move?","Michael R. Splinter","I think they have to be -- everybody will move to the next generation of technology as fast as they can because demand is high, next-generation gives smaller die size. But I think there's time yet to get those technologies to really be production-worthy. And so as soon as they can get them into production, they will. Everybody is working on that next-generation of technology at a breakneck pace. So it's just a matter of how soon those breakthroughs come and how good the transistors are and how reliable they are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse, Barclays Capital.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess with silicon guided down here in July, but you all look for second half to track in line with the first half, curious if your expectations are for a snapback in Q3 or how should we think about the linearity of silicon revenues in the second half?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes, I think that we're thinking that, that will happen in later in the calendar year, not probably in the Q3 time frame, as customers are really trying to get that equipment into production status and starting to build chips. So the way we're looking at it is that the pickup will come in the latter part of the calendar year.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And as follow-up, can you, I guess, outline your expectations for OpEx as we move into the second half? I know clearly, if the market moves around things can change. But assuming that this scenario you've laid out towards the various business segments, how should we think about the trends for OpEx?","George S. Davis","Yes, again for Q3, we would expect to be in the range of $565 million, plus or minus $10 million, certainly down from Q2. And then as we see the effects of synergies increasing and also the impact of the EES restructure, we should be able to move down lower in the range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer, Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions, Mike and George. First on the Display side, when do think you could probably see north of the $200 million run rate level if -- Display has been kind of quiet for few quarters. So when do you think it's going to pop up given that touch panel has been one of the hot areas on the ultrabook side. So any color on that?","George S. Davis","I mean, we think you could see orders certainly bounce up to that level as early as our fourth fiscal quarter. But we would expect that run rate to be certainly more prevalent in 2013 than we're seeing here in 2012.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Second question just a follow-up, the $500 million break even for the EES, a 2-part question: First is what is your conviction that solar equipment spending should come back sometime in '13? And second thing is that do you believe you could be profitable in fiscal '13?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes. We think both of those are possible. It's in part why we aimed the target at $500 million, so that we could be profitable in 2013 with our current level of expected revenue. It's, of course, pretty hard to tell right now, but we're encouraged by what's happening on the end market. We think the first quarter was pretty close to 8 gigawatts of deployment. So we'll see what happens the rest of the year and how close client demand get.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pang, Caris & Company.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One, have your bit growth expectations changed for NAND or DRAM since the year? And the second question is, in terms of the 20-nanometer front [indiscernible] how would you characterize the growth relative to 28-nanometer?","Michael R. Splinter","I'm sorry, Ben, I didn't quite catch the second question on 28-nanometer versus 20-nanometer. We're you talking about capacity or complexity?","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Basically, your market, your, or I guess, the 10,000 [indiscernible] whatever, how much of a bigger opportunity do you guys have with the [indiscernible] as part of the whole. So I just want to see if it's -- is that your biggest opportunity in SSG going forward?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes. Okay, so first on bit growth. Our view on bit growth really hasn't changed much in the last few months. DRAM in the 30% to 40% range, not a lot of momentum there although we see increased footprint on DRAMs and smartphones, which again is another one of those positive signs for DRAMs. And then flash in the 75% bit growth regime. And that's resulting -- and about 1\/3 of that results in capacity additions and 2\/3 in upgrades -- that they're achieving through upgrades. We think the 20-nanometer technology is going to be between 30% and 40% more complex. Layers that are deposition layers, etch layers, inspections that all could accrue to Applied Materials. So our overall SAM, if you will, should increase by roughly that amount on a per wafer start or per 10,000 wafer start basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller, CLS.","Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Mike, I just want to -- I'm not sure you covered it, but there was a decision today on solar import tariffs on the Chinese. I'm just wondering how that -- you might think that might affect your EES business?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes, the import tariffs for -- the anti-dumping import tariffs were certainly larger than we thought, 30%, more than 30% for many -- as many, many Chinese solar manufacturers. These tariffs are on top of some tariff -- some countervailing duty tariffs already levied, so this seems to be pretty steep. It will certainly cause changes in the supply chain. For those global companies, I think they will be able to adjust their supply chain, move around, get access to cells from other regions. It'll also give opportunity, I think, to Taiwanese manufacturers and of course, it will give some benefit to U.S. manufacturers as these tariffs get levied. For Applied Materials, we're selling to pretty much every solar -- every crystalline silicon solar manufacturer. And our focus with them is on reducing cost and improving efficiency. We certainly -- our goal, and I think the goal of most of our customers is to drive the cost down so that governments don't have to intervene into the business either from incentive or tariff kind of situations. So we're going to keep our focus up in this area. In the end, if it doesn't affect demand, my biggest worry that these tariffs would affect in demand, slowdown in demand, that would be a negative for every part of the solar industry, so hopefully they don't do that. But I think there's a pretty big risk of that.","Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And then a quick follow-up for George. How should we think about the gross margins and the tax rate in the second half of the fiscal year?","George S. Davis","Sure. So as we said for the second half of the year, we don't really see a big shift in mix impacting. So I think at the levels that we're seeing today or possibly slightly improved on margin. And the tax rate for the full year, our outlook is still 26% to 27%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg, Pacific Crest.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to comment on the Varian numbers, thanks for breaking those out. That's helpful to see how that business is developing and I'm just wondering if you expect the implant revenue to stay at the current revenue levels through the year or improve? And I'm also wondering if you see an expansion in that market, 14-nanometer logic or 20-nanometer foundry?","George S. Davis","I'll talk about the year and, Mike, maybe you want to talk about the future technology generations. For the year, this is -- the second quarter was just a very, very strong quarter, record quarter for Varian since its inception. So, while I'd like to see every quarter going forward at this level, I think it'll move in line with the rest of the industry. But very, very strong overall.","Michael R. Splinter","Again, we think that making advanced transistors is a very intricate business and implant is going to play an increasingly big role in that. It was part of our thesis from the very beginning of why we were attracted to Varian and the implant business. So we believe that it will be a bigger part of gateless transistors. We think it will be a bigger part of how you dope thin-fed transistors. So we think that this is going to continue to have a growing SAM over the upcoming generations of the technology.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just to clarify why was Q1 so strong for implant, or Q2, sorry?","Michael R. Splinter","Well really, foundry in both our share at foundries, but because 28-nanometer transistors, you can see all of our transistor businesses rise. Epi gets -- there's more passes of epi. There's more implants to adjust the transistors. There's more metal passes to ensure that the transistor performance, the turn-on voltages are set at the right levels. So these devices are getting more complex. We have great technology and products that are really aimed at exactly -- we've been working for years with customers exactly for this inflection.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria, RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","One question on buyback. It looks like you have been buying back about $15 million, $20 million, around $11. Should we think of that, that is going to be the level, and you will increase or decrease at lower and higher prices in terms of buyback?","George S. Davis","What we've said is historically, we've been pretty ratable when we are buying and we've said with the kind of volatility that we're seeing in the markets today that we're going to be a little bit more opportunistic. And so we won't forecast ahead of the quarter what amount we're going to buy, but we certainly expect to be active buyers at these levels.","Michael Sullivan","And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan ","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Applied\u2019s fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike. I'm pleased to report our results for the quarter were at the top end of guidance driven by a healthy uptick in demand for semiconductor equipment combined with strong execution across the company. This rounds out a solid year of performance in a challenging environment, as we navigated down cycles in both memory and display. These results would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of Applied Materials employees around the world. I would like to thank them for the passion they bring to work every day and congratulate them on their accomplishments this year. ","As this is our year end call, I'll begin with a brief recap of the past 12 months before providing our perspective on the current market environment. I'll then talk about the broader context for the industry, including the major growth drivers and inflections that will shape our markets over the next several years. I'll conclude by summarizing the key elements of our strategy and outlining the investments we're making to put Applied in the best position for the tremendous opportunities ahead. ","Applied\u2019s fiscal 2019 was shaped by the first significant pullback in customer investments since 2013. However, this provides a good illustration of how the semiconductor industry is evolving. As I have highlighted before, the market for semi equipment and services is now significantly larger and less volatile than it was in the past. If the second calendar quarter of 2019 proves to be the low point of the spending cycle, then the downturn lasted four quarters and our quarterly revenue at the trough was approximately 20% lower than at the peak. ","In contrast, during the industry cycles that took place between 2000 and 2013, our average peak to trough revenue drop was more than twice that magnitude. This cycle was different in large part due to the growth in diversification of demand drivers spanning consumer and enterprise end markets. It\u2019s also important to note that the fundamental dynamics of the memory market are healthier through this cycle. The memory makers are highly focused making disciplined investments in capacity and continuing to drive their technology roadmaps forward. As well as a more robust core market Applied is a more resilient company that's balanced across different areas of the market and can perform well in a variety of conditions. Thanks to the breadth of our portfolio, our semi equipment business is outperforming both the wafer fab equipment market and our direct peers this year.","Fiscal 2019 was also a record year for Applied Global Services. In fact, we're growing our services revenue significantly faster than underlying equipment businesses. Over the past 12 months, we've grown our installed base of semi and display equipment by about 2,000 systems to almost 43,000. We have also increased the number of installed base tools covered by long-term service agreement which generates subscription style revenues by around 30% since 2017.","Overall, 45% of our FY \u201819 revenues came from sources other than new 300 millimeter equipment sales. This is up from 41% just two years ago. ","In terms of our near-term outlook, while I don't want to speculate about the exact shape or timing of the market recovery, I can characterize what we currently see with three observations. First, strong investment by foundry logic customers, driven by demand in key geographies and acceleration of the 5G roadmap and commitment to advance the leading-edge. Second, early signs of a recovery in NAND investments. And third, positive progression of the ongoing inventory correction in DRAM. ","Because of the strength seen in recent months, we're revising our estimates for 2019 wafer fab equipment upwards. We now believe 2019 spending levels could be similar to 2017. Based on the visibility we have today, we're optimistic about 2020 with an expectation of sustained strength in foundry logic and a step-up in memory investments during the year with NAND recovering ahead of DRAM. ","In display, as anticipated, FY \u201819 revenues were down a third relative to FY \u201818. At this point, we expect FY '20 revenues to be at similar levels as we bounce along the bottom of this market cycle. In this environment, our display business remains profitable even as we fund R&D for next generation products.","We still believe the display market provides good long-term growth opportunities for Applied as the industry becomes increasingly technology-intensive. We remain focused on working closely with customers to drive their technology roadmaps forward and ensuring we have the right portfolio of products in place to outperform the market when investment levels pick up. ","Looking beyond the cycle at the broader context for the electronics industry, it's important to recognize that we are in a period of transition as major new growth drivers emerge in the form of IoT, Big Data, and artificial intelligence. Over the next decade, we expect hundreds of billions of edge devices to be deployed, and explosion of data generation and new approaches to computing to sustainably process and create value from all the data that's available. ","AI and Big Data have the potential to transform every area of the economy and our lives. These inflections will also have a profound impact on the semiconductor industry. As we move from the age of general purpose computing to domain-specific approaches, new system architectures and new types of semiconductor devices are needed in the data center and at the edge. A major factor in the adoption rate of AI will be how quickly we can realize improvements in the power, performance, area and cost or PPAC of the foundational semiconductor technologies. ","However, at a time when PPAC improvements are on the critical path, classic Moore's Law scaling is slowing. To drive the PPAC roadmap in the future, a new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing is needed. This playbook has five main elements, new architectures, new devices and 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink the feature geometries and new ways to connect chips together. Then to accelerate implementation of this new playbook, I strongly believe the ecosystem needs to work together differently by breaking down traditional industry silos.","At Applied, we've aligned our strategy and investments around this vision of the future. While we are carefully managing all non-R&D spending, we're investing more than ever in new capabilities and products to accelerate the new playbook. ","We recently announced the official opening of our META Center in New York. This state-of-the art facility enables us to work with customers and partners in new ways, accelerating the transfer of novel technologies from lab to fab. I'm equally excited about how our future product pipeline is shaping up. In addition to our traditional unit process equipment, which spans deposition, removal, modification, and analysis of materials, we're developing entirely new categories of products that we call Integrated Materials Solutions. The applications for these IMS products include co-optimization of deposition, removal and analysis, all the way to creating, shaping, modifying and analyzing new structures and devices. We'll share more details as we bring new products to market in 2020 and 2021. ","For the time being, let me highlight a few examples of how we are defending our leadership positions, winning new applications and expanding our available market in the near term. In DRAM, customers are introducing advanced transistors and interconnects to improve performance and low power. These technologies where Applied has long held leadership were originally developed for logic applications, and are now migrating to memory. Growing demand for specialty nodes that serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power and image sensor markets is also driving robust investments in capacity and new technologies. PPAC improvements are equally important for these applications. And we're finding new ways to migrate our leading-edge technologies into these specialty markets.","Advanced patterning is a critical enabler for shrinking feature geometries, which translates to a large growing opportunity in foundry logic and DRAM. The patterning roadmap is increasingly enabled by new materials as well as co-optimization of materials deposition and removal. As a result, we are expanding our positions in memory and winning new applications at foundry logic customers. And in markets where we have plenty of room to grow, we're also building momentum. In optical wafer inspection, we're winning new positions at foundry logic customers. And in etch, we've recently won multiple critical applications in NAND, as well as in foundry logic, where we delivered record etch revenues for the year.","Before I hand the call over to Dan, let me summarize. First, we're seeing a strong finish to 2019, driven by a healthy uptick in foundry logic spending. Although it's still too early to call the shape and timing of the recovery in memory, we're encouraged by the signs we're seeing. Second, we have a strong positive point of view about the opportunities, the AI-Big Data era will create for the industry and Applied. While we're tightly controlling non-R&D related spending, we are investing more than ever in new products and capabilities that put us in winning positions for the future. Third, the technical collaboration between Applied and our customers has never been stronger, and we're working with a broader set of customers and partners to accelerate the time-to-market for new game-changing technologies.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Durn","Thanks Gary. Applied delivered another solid quarter in Q4, with revenue, margins and earnings in the upper-end of our guidance range. I like the way we ended our fiscal year and I particularly like the way we're set up for the year ahead. On today's call, I'll summarize our fiscal 2019, give you my sense of the business entering fiscal 2020 and share our outlook for Q1.","In 2019, our end markets were softer across semi, display and the transactional portion of our services business. Despite that, we delivered revenue of $14.6 billion and our quarterly revenue and earnings were stable, which demonstrates the resilience of our broad portfolio, even in a memory correction year. In fact, we earned significantly more in every quarter in fiscal 2019 than we did in all of fiscal 2013, which is the most recent year that included a significant equipment correction. I also like our relative performance. ","In calendar 2019, we expect to significantly outperform our core market and our most direct peers. Specifically, while the equipment market will be down by mid-teen percentage, we expect semi equipment plus AGS to be down in the mid-single-digits year-over-year.","Looking ahead to 2020 and beyond, we have high confidence in the future growth of our markets and the unique opportunities Applied has to enable our customers\u2019 roadmaps. As a result, we invested a record amount in R&D this year, while reducing our spending in SG&A. We delivered over $3 in non-GAAP earnings per share and generated nearly $3.25 billion of cash from operations.","Our capital return strategy is to fully fund our profitable growth opportunities, maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver attractive cash returns to our shareholders through dividends and dividend growth along with opportunistic share buyback. ","In 2019, we've returned nearly $3.2 billion to shareholders, equivalent to 113% of free cash flow. We returned nearly $800 million in dividends, raised the dividend by 5% and took advantage of market volatility to repurchase 60 million shares of our stock at an average price of $39.86. As a reminder, we're working to complete the acquisition of Kokusai Electric. Upon close, we plan to direct most of our free cash flow towards repaying the term loan we're using to help fund the transaction.","Now, I'll share my thoughts on the business environment. On our previous earnings call, I talked about positive leading indicators of future growth. These included inventory reductions across memory, demand elasticity in NAND and strong foundry, logic demand both in leading edge and specialty nodes. Today, I feel more positive. In semi, we have strong pull for our leadership products, including record demand for epitaxy, a metal deposition. We're also winning many new applications for our high growth semi products in dielectric deposition, etch and inspection. We are significantly outgrowing our markets in foundry, logic, with growing strength of the leading-edge nodes and key wins in automotive and advanced packaging. While it\u2019s always hard to call the timing and magnitude of a recovery in memory, we think it's a matter of when, not if, and we expect NAND to lead the way.","In AGS, revenue was stronger than we expected in Q4, and we still expect better than seasonal revenue in Q1. The subscription-like portion of AGS has momentum and will benefit from the thousands of new systems we added to our installed base in 2019. The transactional portion of the business should strengthen as memory utilization recovers in 2020. ","Rolling it all up, we are entering the new fiscal year with a backlog of $6.5 billion, which is our highest year-end backlog ever.","Now, I'll provide our Q1 guidance. We expect company revenue of $4.10 billion, plus or minus $150 million, which would be up by about 9% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.95 per share. Within this outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to be approximately $2.775 billion. Services revenue should be about $975 million and display revenue should be around $330 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 44.6% and non-GAAP OpEx should be around $800 million.","In summary, I like the setup for Applied as we enter fiscal 2020. Our thesis surrounding IoT, Big Data and AI is being validated throughout the ecosystem and our business outlook is transitioning from positive leading indicators to growing demand. The investments we're making in the new playbook are strengthening our product portfolio and driving new design wins that will service exceptionally well as the new nodes ramp across foundry, logic, NAND, and DRAM. Our opportunities in the specialty nodes are also expanding. Our services business delivered a record year in 2019 and is on track for solid year-over-year growth in 2020.","Finally, we look forward to closing the acquisition of Kokusai Electric and welcoming its talented team to Applied Materials. ","Now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks Dan. Now to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and not more than one brief follow-up. Operator, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.","C.J. Muse","I know you don't want to be too specific around the timing and magnitude of recovery in memory. But I was hoping perhaps you could give just a little bit more color around your product positioning for when that does come, as you look at leadership product as well as some of the new products that you have in the pipeline that you expect to come to market in 2020?","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, C.J. So, what we're seeing in memory is customers continuing to drive technology roadmaps this year, even if they're cutting the capacity additions to help with supply and demand. We really like the setup for Applied when memory spending recovers, which we think is in 2020 led by NAND. So, if we look at different types of devices, in DRAM customers are moving to more advanced metal gate transistors in the periphery, and this is going to drive more demand like we saw in 28 nanometer foundry. So, that's really positive for us in leadership areas like Epi, PVD, implant, thermals, also we are gaining share in etch. We're also enabling new DRAM capacitor module capabilities and new patterning technologies that create large new opportunities for Applied where we're reducing the number of steps for multi-patterning and also improving pattern placement.","So DRAM, especially with the more logic-like types of steps really plays to our leadership positions. And so, as those nodes go forward, we're in a good position in DRAM. ","In 3D NAND, as customers are scaling beyond 96 layers, we're winning new applications with etch and NAND. And as you go to more layers, you need new materials, especially high selectivity hard masks designed in to many of the next nodes as they ramp into a high-volume manufacturing. We also have momentum with integrated materials solutions. One example is in NAND where we do co-optimization of new hard mask films with the sensory etch, the co-optimization increases etch selectivity by about 50% and we're seeing new [DAP] [ph] and etch wins across multiple customers as we enable much better high aspect ratio patterning. So, strong pull across all the NAND customers for new materials, new products, Integrated Material Solutions we're seeing both in NAND and in DRAM. So, we're optimistic we're going to continue to drive strong growth as customers scale to future nodes.","C.J. Muse","If I could sneak in a quick follow-up, like you said we could do a quick one, second one. On the service side, you talked about the excellent growth in your installed base and we're coming off of fiscal '19 [growth of 3%] [ph], how are you thinking about the trajectory from here particularly as utilization rates on the memory front start to move higher?","Dan Durn","Yes. Thanks, C.J. This is Dan. I'll jump in and take that. So, the services business is a great growth driver for us. It's been a steady source of revenue growth, cash flow generation. I'd say over the last handful of years, this is a business that's grown at a compound rate of about 15% per year. In the current downturn, current year, memory driven downturn, utilizations following, the business is a low single-digit grower. When you include things like refurbs and upgrades, you're a mid-single-digit grower, so good performance in a very difficult market that's down about mid-teens. As we think about the performance of the business that drives those results, the long-term service agreement portion of the business this year was up mid-teens. It's really the transactional portion of our services business that's fallen with industry utilization and has been a headwind to growth this year. And that's in sort of down 10%, 11%. As we profile into 2020, we really like the setup around our services business going forward. We think we can continue to execute on the long-term service agreements and continue to drive that performance at the levels we've seen historically. And when industry utilization recovers in memory, we would expect our transactional business to transition from a headwind of growth to a growth at or for us in 2020. So we really like the setup and the execution of the team in this environment. We think it sets us up well for 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open.","Atif Malik","Good job on the results and guidance. So first, Gary, can you talk about the puts and takes between OLED and LCD in your kind of flattish display outlook at this point? We hear Samsung display is resuming construction of A5 and some [TV fabs] [ph] in China are pushing out. And as my follow up, Dan, if you can talk about the OpEx profile for the remainder of the fiscal \u201820?","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Atif. I'll actually take both parts of your question. So as we go to the display market and we think about how 2019 played out, it played out exactly as we expected. We sit down about a third year-over-year and that's where we ended up. Where forecast expectations were set probably three, six months ago, embedded in that was incremental growth off of these levels. And what really drove that incremental growth is as we said solid performance of the TV market into next year and the handset market would recover creating incremental growth for the company. We think the handset market is going to play out exactly as expected. We're going to see recovery in the handset market. ","What's happened in the interim in the TV side is, is we've seen several news headlines from some of our customers about delayed investments there's a bit of inventory build on the TV side. Third-party research firm has come out and confirmed what we've been reading about in the headlines. And our customer conversations also confirm this dynamic. And so as we look forward into 2020, we think there's going to be some incremental softness on the TV side that reflects all of the news that's out in the market to date. We expect the handset to recover as we originally expected, and that gets us to flattish profile, similar revenue levels to what we're seeing this year. That's the best way I would describe it. ","And then from an OpEx perspective, I think we're going to take this one quarter at a time, we came up to 800. We all know that profiling into Q2 there's the full impact of merit, and we don't get the benefit of the shutdown over the holiday season. And so, maybe that goes up incrementally to 820 to reflect that dynamic. That gives you a sense of where we level out on those, typical seasonal aspects of transitioning from Q1 to Q2 and then we probably hover in that neighborhood for the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Toshiya Hari","Gary, you talked quite a bit about your expectations around new products into next year. I was hoping you could remind us roughly what percentage of WFE you guys serve today at Applied and how that would expand with some of these new products going into 2020 and 2021? And kind of related to that, obviously, you seem to be picking up share nicely in 2019. What are your kind of preliminary expectations into 2020 when you think about your potential outperformance relative to the market? And then I have a follow up. Thank you.","Dan Durn","Hi, Toshiya. This is Dan. On the first one, the percentage of the addressable market that we focus on, it\u2019s going to vary from a year-to-year depending on the spend mix and profile of our customers. But the best way to think about it is, low to mid 60s part of WFE or the markets that we can address in any given year. That's going to vary and change again from a year-to-year depending on that profile mix and I think some of the new products that we end up bringing to market, I think it\u2019s going to help drive our growth in share in the current markets that we serve, maybe there is some adjacencies we begin to look at, maybe it pushes it towards the higher end of the range over time. But it's still going to be in that low to mid 60s zip code depending on any given year and what customers happen to be spending on.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Toshiya, I guess -- and I can also add a little bit of color. I think relative to the different areas where we compete today, definitely we're driving innovations and unit processes around deposition, removal, modification and analysis. We have momentum with some new products and we have some major new products in the pipeline that we're driving. But beyond that, as we've talked about before, you've got AI-Big Data need for 1000 times improvement in performance per watt and classic Moore\u2019s Law 2D scaling not big enough really to meet those needs for a performance per watt. So, we're not only driving unit processes, one thing that we've also been driving are the Integrated Material Solution. We are co-optimizing steps, and even integrating multiple steps in a single system under high vacuum, and we have really strong pull from customers. Again, not just for unit processes where -- again I want to emphasize we're driving very hard with some big new products in the pipeline, some we already see some adoption, early momentum. But beyond that, it's really how do we enable not just materials or removal, how do we create structures, shape structures, modify and analyze structures. And I\u2019ve spent a lot of my time with R&D leaders across our customer base, tremendously strong pull for improvements in power performance and Applied is in the best position, both with unit processes and with these integrated processes to enable the future. So, tremendous, tremendous pull for both of those different areas.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you. And then if I can squeeze one in as a follow-up. Dan, can you give us an update on the Kokusai acquisition? What were some of the regulatory hurdles that you still need to overcome? And then I guess, with the acquisition you are obviously gaining some exposure to batch processing. When you look across your product and technology portfolio at this point, do you feel like it\u2019s complete or is this future M&A still on the table? Thank you.","Dan Durn","Yes. Thanks Toshiya. I'll jump in on the first part, transition to Gary on the second part. For Kokusai, there's no change in the timing of the transaction. We announced the 12 month timeline when we announced the transaction. We received regulatory approval in Ireland and Israel. We had four other geographies. We're continuing to stay close to the regulators in those geographies. And we like the progress we're making but no change to the timeline from what we announced when we announced the transaction.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, Toshiya relative to Kokusai, we still see it as a great opportunity to expand our markets with batch technology and services to accelerate innovation for customers. So nothing has changed in all of the feedback we're getting from customers versus what we saw at the beginning, relative to the opportunity to create value. Relative to M&A, our strategy really hasn't changed. We continue to focus on three things: a great financial return; synergy to accelerate our customer value and also our growth; and market leadership potential. And we still believe we have a very good organic growth opportunity, so the bar remains very high. And we're not needing for M&A but anything that we look at that fits that criteria, we definitely will continue to investigate and move forward if we find something that fits that criteria.","Operator","Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company, Your line is now open.","Krish Sankar","I have two of them, one maybe for either Dan or Gary. I think in the past you guys have spoken about the data analytics talking about two year out WFE, maybe you want to think about it, maybe not. If not, I'm just trying to put numbers around it. If next year, all those being the same as this year if NAND WFE is up 10%, what kind of a growth expectation should you expect for AMAT NAND business, or your semi business? ","And then as a quick follow up for Dan. I think you mentioned this in your Jan quarter guidance. Can you give any breakdown between foundry, logic DRAM and NAND? Thank you. ","Dan Durn","Krish, I didn't understand the first part of your question. You said something about analytics. But then I heard you talk about NAND. So I know you're in Europe. Maybe we missed a syllable. ","Krish Sankar","Let me just make it simple. If in 2020, if everything else being equal, if NAND WFE is up 10%, I am just putting some numbers out there, how should be expect AMAT semiconductor business driven by NAND to perform or outperform. And also on the Jan quarter, if you can give a break down between foundry, logic, DRAM and NAND?","Dan Durn","Thanks, Krish. From a WFE standpoint, we don't want to get into guides around next year. But what I would say is, since Gary has come into company, we've become very balanced as a company in terms of our penetration of device types. This is a very balanced company. I think we're seeing the benefits of that in this environment as we inflect from one device type to another. And I think it surged the company well in a time of uncertainty. The company has worked hard, made a lot of investments to create that very balanced portfolio by device type. And so without being specific, I would just leave you with that contextual thought that we're fairly agnostic to how these device types flash in one quarter or another. And I think that gives you some parameters on how to think about things. ","From a guidance standpoint, we don't guide by device type, but the thing I would highlight is, next quarter will be a record quarter for us in foundry, logic based on the guidance that we've given. But we typically don't guide by device type.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Gary, just my first question, you guys have done a great job to kind of talking about trends relative to device type. But I hope if you can give update probably just on China for this calendar year? And when you talk out to 2020, how important is growth as far as China relative to your optimism next year?","Gary Dickerson","Our view on China is pretty similar to what we communicated before. The domestic China market is incrementally stronger than our view at the beginning of the year, within the range of what we had expected, but incrementally stronger. And we now anticipate domestic China will be up from last year to around $6.5 billion. Longer-term -- I've been in many meetings and conferences over the last several years, and my message is the same today's as it's been over the last several years. We still expect steady growth in China, so we think next year will be another year of investments. But we don't see hockey sticks. Again what we do is we look at leading indicators for all of the different projects, either domestic or international. And again, our view is again very, very similar to what I\u2019ve talked about the past. We think there's going to be steady growth. We're positive about the market. We're positive about our position in the market. Our share continues to be healthy and accretive to our overall global market share. So, that's kind of a top-level view for China.","Dan Durn","And just to add a couple of things to what Gary said, John. As you think about our planning, we always have base cases, we always have upsides. We will be ready to respond if there is upside to our base case but that's not currently baked into our planning assumptions. And Gary highlighted exactly right. We've been talking for several years now about slow steady development of an ecosystem there, investing in technology roadmaps. We saw it last year. We see a follow through on it this year. We will see a follow through on it again next year and we're not planning for any hockey sticks associated with investments in that geography.","John Pitzer","Then as my follow up Gary, just going back to your comments about foundry, logic looking sustainable going into calendar year '20, I guess just given the recent CapEx raise from TSMC and sort of the implied run rate for calendar fourth quarter, I guess there is a lot of concern in the investment community that perhaps from Q4 run rate levels things will have to come down as you go into 2020. I\u2019d like to hear your view on that. And the foundry weakens in the back half of the next year just because it\u2019s so strong now, do you think logic sort of picks up the slack? Was your comment about sustainability a full year comment or kind of a current run rate level comment? Thank you.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Thanks, John. Let me jump in on that and give you my perspective. So what we see in the foundry, logic right now, I would consider and characterize as demand led. We had a solid Q4 in the foundry, logic market. Implicit in the guide for Q1 is a record foundry, logic quarter for this company. We ended the year with backlog at record levels. So, the foundry, logic view we see as follow-through into next year and it's not a one quarter phenomenon. There is a strong pull from customers for the tools. It's multiple customers and multiple nodes, which gives us a sense of comfort. We take a look at the foundry market and one foundry customer are well under the ramp of N7, volume production at N7+, N5 and risk production, volume production in the first half of 2020 and N6 risk production in the first half of '20, volume production in the second half of 2020. You could make other similar comments about leading edge technology nodes ramping at other foundry, logic customers exposed to the leading edge. So multiple customers, multiple nodes. ","In addition to seeing strength on the leading edge, we continue to see strength on trailing node geometries and specialty nodes, that continues. And while we don't have perfect visibility for the full year, we're very positive on the foundry, logic market over the long run. We are layering in the next wave of compute in the semiconductor industry to complement what is already there in the form of PC demand and mobile compute demand. We've got new architecture sharing data centers, lots of new tape outs, cloud demand is recovering, 5G beginning to kick in. We see a proliferation of intelligent edge devices and auto is growing. ","And so as we take a step back, we see the strength continuing into next year. We're really positive about the long run. But as I provide a little more context on 2020, the company is performing well. We talked about the backlog entering the year. We talked about strength in foundry, logic. We talked about AGS set up and looks good as we profile into next year. Swing factor next year for us is timing of the memory recovery. For us, it's a matter of when, not if. And so it's really tough to determine the timing and magnitude of that. And we'll stay close to the market, stay close to our customers. And as new information becomes available, we'll try to be as open and transparent as we can be to help investors. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. ","Harlan Sur","On the better performance in AGS in the October quarter and strong outlook into January, I would assume that the long-term subscription part of the model is very predictable. So was the incremental strength, the transactional business, maybe starting to come back as some of your customer utilization starts to rise, are they bringing back some idle capacity? And if it is that, is it more foundry, logic or memory driven? ","Dan Durn","Yes, thanks, Harlan. You're right. The long-term service agreement part of the business is continuing to chug along. We really liked the performance and that's against the backdrop of a tough market. We talked about the transactional nature of the business, transactional spares last quarter, being bit of a temporary dynamic with a limited number of customers and this is us just getting back to more normalized environment. Clearly, customers are seeing the strength we're beginning to flash in foundry, logic. I think we're seeing some early signs around the setup for memory as we go forward led by NAND and DRAM. And it's hard to really parse against that contextual backdrop, exactly what's in customers\u2019 minds when they drive transactional part of the business. I would just say, in general, it feels like a good setup with some positive momentum. And we feel good about that setup, as we look into 2020.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, and I think the big needle mover is really memory. Memory utilization, certainly the agreement -- the agreements, as Dan said, we\u2019re up to maybe close to 60% of spares and service with agreements where we have higher revenue per tool. But a big incremental driver will be when memory comes back and utilization goes up in those memory factories. And certainly as Dan said earlier, we expect that to happen in NAND first. And as he said earlier, it\u2019s a question of if not when -- when not if. So, it\u2019s definitely going to happen in some time here and we hope the NAND starts in 2020.","Harlan Sur","And when we think between cost per bit declines in memory, both DRAM and NAND, the rate of those declines is decelerating pretty dramatically. So, productivity by your customers is a big focus, more batch-based systems is a focus and one of the drivers for the Kokusai acquisition. But what else is the Applied team doing to help customers improve productivity?","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Thanks for the question. So, I talked earlier about co-optimizing hard mask materials with etch to improve etch selectivity. Now that's certainly for the high aspect ratio of patterning, incredibly important. We have other cases where we are working with customers on patterning, while we\u2019re reducing -- I mentioned that earlier, we're reducing the cost of multiple patterning. In some cases, we're able to reduce the cost to 30%, and also enable a better pattern placement. So, for memory, especially in NAND, those are some the areas we're driving. Another area is in the performance with the periphery going to more logic like structures, especially higher speed memory devices, that's an area that plays to our leadership products and certainly we see tremendous traction from customers in those areas.","I think longer-term, it's about how do you optimize new structures, creating, shaping, modifying, analyzing new structures. We have a lot that we're doing today in co-optimization of those capabilities. A tremendous amount in the pipeline where we have very strong customer pull.","Michael Sullivan","And operator and the people on the call, I think that we're running a little short on time. We know, there is a lot of people in the queue. I'm going to ask that we go to one question right now and no follow-ups please, just so that we can hear from more of you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Your line is now open.","Pierre Ferragu","Could you give us -- I have heard with a lot of interest the answers you\u2019ve given on your outlook in logic and how you see things evolving? Is there a way you could give us some sense of how you expect or you\u2019re change on two specific nodes, so the one that I have in mind the TSMC nodes, when TSMC moves from 7 nanometer to 7 plus, so some kind of critical dimensions but more EUV in session. And at Intel, between the 10 nanometer node and the 7 nanometer node, same thing, a lot of additional EUV layers. I understand you guys remain very well exposed to this new EUV heavy nodes but I image that when you move from multiple patterning to EUV the type of business you get is different. So could you describe that for us please? ","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Thanks, Pierre. So, it\u2019s important to remember that when customers are scaling -- I would say the first thing is that they are driving five different areas where shrinking is one of those five different areas. We talked about new architectures, new structures, new materials, new ways to connect chips together and the shrink. So again, we have tremendously unique technologies enabling that new playbook. And I'm with one of the R&D leaders for one of our customers next week, with another one the following week. Again, constantly, we're getting tremendous pull in driving power and performance because it\u2019s very, very, very difficult. So the first thing I would say is that we have unique capabilities in enabling the new playbook. That's where we're investing, that\u2019s where we have tremendous engagements with customers. ","So then if you think about shrinking, I talked earlier on the call about where we're working with customers on multiple patterning. And there are cases where we're able to reduce the number of steps by 30% and increase pattern placements. So that's another area we're doing co-optimization. And it's also important to remember that as you're scaling and EUV layers come in, some other steps also need to shrink and multi-patterning is still growing. So with Applied, the EUV steps that are coming in to replace other steps are not our steps. So Applied has opportunities and we are winning. When EUV is being adopted in some of those replacement steps, there's this focus on multi-patterning where we're focused on reducing steps, reducing costs. ","I think another -- Pierre another really good example is in 2019 in foundry, logic, we have very strong momentum with our sensory etcher. And this is where you're seeing the highest EUV adoption. We're seeing very high growth in 2019 with wins across many customers, and we definitely see significant growth, much faster than the market with our sensory etch business in leading foundry customers. And we anticipate based on the wins that we have, we're going to continue to grow at 5 and 3, as these new technologies are being adopted. Just another data point with Sym3, that's the fastest ramping product in the history of Applied, we just shipped our 4,000th chamber, and many of them going into foundry and logic. So that's kind of a top-level view. I would say, again, the key thing for all of these customers is how do they drive the technology roadmap for power and performance. 2D scaling is slowing down, they need new ways to drive the roadmap, and that's really the sweet spot for Applied Materials.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open. ","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Gary, if think you just provided a little bit of color already to the question I have. But with capital intensity trends for foundry and logic continuing to increase, as we go from 7 to 5 and eventually 3, aside from say like the etch Sym3 and products like that, where else are you seeing I guess increasing capital intensity trends on the foundry, logic that helps both your leadership tools, or your leadership businesses, as well as some of the growth opportunities? Aside from the etch, are you seeing it in deposition, are you seeing it in the process control area? What other areas are you seeing that growth in capital intensity trends from your products?","Gary Dickerson","Yes, thanks for the question, Patrick. So if we look at 2019, we talked about a record foundry, logic performance. And we have a very strong incumbent leadership position, as you talked about in foundry, logic; a much larger business and more diverse business than our process tool peers. And that's driving our outperformance in 2019. So if we look at foundry, logic, in this calendar year we will have the highest foundry, logic revenue ever, highest Epi revenue ever, and highest metals revenue ever. So, those are areas that are part of our leadership products. We are working with customers on new materials like tungsten deposition, shaping structures with selective removal where we are gaining key wins. That's enabling performance gains for our customers and growth for Applied. So those are some of the areas where we are seeing growth. In terms of 2019 we're also see strong growth besides etch, in CVD, thermal. And you talked about inspection, that's an area where we just introduced a new product. We are seeing very strong adoption and that will give us momentum to grow quickly in that business in 2020. So, anyway, that's a little bit of color around some of the areas that we're driving. But it really does get back to driving power and performance area and cost for customers and really more and more, not just with unit processes, but also with these integrated solutions is a sweet spot for Applied and gives us tremendous momentum going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. Dan, I just had a question on gross margin guidance. There's hardly any incremental drop through year-over-year, yet you are doing like $350 million more in revenue but gross margin is the same. I guess it's a little surprising because SSG which is the highest margin segment is up a lot year-over-year. So, are SSG margins lower in January, because it seems like the margins at a corporate level should be 150 basis points higher something like that. So can you just walk me through that? Thanks.","Gary Dickerson","Sure, Tim. We won't guide gross margins, but let me -- by segments. But let me share with you a little bit of what we do see in gross margin. As you know, gross margin in any given quarter, so it\u2019s going to be a function of a few things, revenue level, segment mix, product mix, customer mix, factory activity. All are going to vary from quarter-to-quarter and go into the gross margin. We think our performance compares favorably with our peers ever this cycle. Our peak to trough gross margin over this cycle was down about 210 basis points to our next closest competitors in the process tool space. One was down 300, another was down 310. And as we were profiling into the back part of the calendar year on a relative basis, I think that gross margin performance on the quarter-over-quarter basis also looks pretty good.","So, we like how are executing. Are we ever satisfied with our gross margins? No. Are we maniacally focused on driving improvements and improving the cost structure? Absolutely. We are going to keep at it. We are going to continue to work hard and I think you are seeing breadth and depth of our portfolio in a broad sense play out in the gross margin resiliency over the course of the cycle. ","Michael Sullivan ","Hey, thank you for asking the question, Tim.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Vivek Arya ","Thank you for taking my question. Just thinking conceptually about next year, if foundry, logic sustains and memory is really incremental to the model, and I think you're starting at a low level, but just a run rate implies that your growth through the year. Does that say your January quarter is the low point of the year in terms of sales and gross margins?","Dan Durn","I'm sorry, Vivek, could you please repeat it. It cut out on this end. I just want to make sure I got the full question, sorry.","Vivek Arya ","Sure. Yes, of course, Dan. So if memory spending is incremental to the model from here on, and you said foundry and logic should sustain, and even on the display side, I think you're starting at a low point in January, does it say that your January quarter outlook is the low point of the year in terms of sales and gross margins that things could actually conceptually get better in the year as memory recovers.","Dan Durn","So I guess, the best way for me to describe it, because I think what we're going to do is we're going to guide one quarter at a time, and the environment is clearly better today than it was a quarter ago or six months ago. And what I would say just at the very highest level, companies performing well. We've got a good backlog entering the year. You pointed out strengths in foundry logic services, swing factor in the year. I said it before, it's really the essence of the issue, the swing factor for the year is going to be what happens in the memory market. So we're going to stay close to customers, we're going to be ready to respond when the NAND market starts to hit, followed by DRAM. And we'll take it one quarter at a time. So I don't think we want to start giving multiple quarter guidance and shaping the full year given some of the uncertainty we see from a timing standpoint on when things like memory are going to start to flash.","A - Michael Sullivan ","Thanks Vivek. And operator, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.","Quinn Bolton ","And I guess I just want to follow-up on John, and the next question's there just, it seems almost illogical for us to assume that the foundry strength that you're seeing in the January quarter sustained at that quarterly level through each quarter of fiscal '20, so that would get the business up probably well into the teens, if not 20%, year-on-year, and so again I guess not asking you necessarily guidance quarter-to-quarter, but isn't it logical to assume that you're probably not going to sustain that peak quarterly revenue at foundry in every quarter of 2020? Thanks.","Dan Durn ","Yes, no question, Quinn, and my sustainability into next year is really meant to be that it's not going to be a one quarter phenomenon. We've got a nice backlog, Q4 was a really nice quarter for us in foundry, logic. Q1 will be a record quarter, and I think it would be probably not the right place to set expectation to think every quarter is going to be at a record foundry, logic level. And so while the activity level can be nice, it doesn't always have to be a record.","Michael Sullivan ","Okay, great, well thank you, Quinn. And I think we're almost at the end of our hour. Dan anything you would like to say in closing.","Dan Durn ","Sure, Mike. Just a couple of quick thoughts, first like I said at the beginning, I'm pleased with the way we ended the fiscal year, and I especially like the setup for Applied in 2020 given a record year-end backlog and the momentum that we see in key parts of the business. Second, we look forward to staying close to investors. December 3rd, Gary and I are going to be at the Credit Suisse Conference in Scottsdale. Next week after that I'll be at the UBS Conference in New York. In the meantime, we hope you all have a happy and safe Thanksgiving with your families. Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.","Michael Sullivan ","Okay, great. Thanks, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of our call is going to be available on our website by 5:00 PM Pacific Time. And we would like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference calls. Thank you for participating.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you. In a moment, we\u2019ll discuss the results for our third quarter which ended on July 31. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements including Applied\u2019s current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions, profitability and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, and are not guarantees of future performance.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today\u2019s earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor\u2019s page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","Next, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that Applied Materials plans to hold its 2016 Analyst Meeting in New York City on Wednesday, September 21. Those of you joining us in New York will have the option to attend technology sessions with our general managers. The main event will be webcast live.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered record earnings in Q3. And with our orders also at an all-time high, I\u2019m confident that we can beat this earnings record again in our fourth quarter.","I want to thank our employees for all their hard work that has contributed to these outstanding results and their passion to keep raising the bar. I\u2019ll start today by outlining the key factors supporting these record levels of performance and describe how our strategy positions Applied for sustainable long-term growth.","I\u2019ll also share our latest view on our markets in detail why Applied has a positive outlook for 2017 and beyond. I\u2019ll conclude with brief updates on each of our major businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our results and outlook.","In both semiconductor and display, we see dramatic advances in technology taking place. We are in the early stages of large multi-year industry inflections that are driving growth in our business today and creating new opportunities for the future.","First, foundry and logic customers are making significant innovations in transistor and interconnect for 10 and 7-nanometer devices. This plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses, including Epi, PVD, Implant, CMP and RTP, where we lead the industry with our unique capabilities and high market share. As customers move to 10-nanometer technology, the available market for these leadership businesses grows by around 25% compared to the previous node.","The second key inflection is 3D NAND. This is a materials-enabled technology that significantly expands our addressable market with innovative new products we are providing customers with the advanced solutions they need for depositing, removing, and modifying materials with incredible precision. As a result, we are winning significant share gains as the industry shifts from planar to 3D technology. By the end of this year, we will have grown our share of total NAND spending by almost 7 points above our 2012 baseline.","The third big wave of investment is China, which represents an important long-term growth opportunity for the industry. Applied has been working in China for 32 years, and during this time, we\u2019ve established the strongest position in the region. While the build out of China\u2019s semiconductor industry has only just begun, our semiconductor orders in revenue have already doubled over the past two years, and we\u2019re on track for a record 2016.","The fourth big driver for Applied is organic LED displays. OLED is also enabled by materials innovation and that makes our available market opportunity more than three times larger than for traditional LCD. OLED is the key for high resolution low-powered screens with faster refresh rates. We expect it to become the standard for virtual reality capable phones and headsets.","At Applied, our strategy is to develop highly differentiated materials engineering products and services that make new technologies possible. As our customers technical challenges become more complex, it\u2019s the breadth and depth of our capabilities that sets us apart. By building on these strengths, we are outperforming our markets today and creating a foundation for sustainable growth over the years to come.","We are making great progress with all of the key elements of our strategy. First, we have strengthened our organization and processes in the field. In the past three years, we have increased the number of technologists and engineers directly supporting customers by 50%. This allows us to see inflections earlier and define winning products in a more repeatable way.","Second, we have increased R&D to accelerate new product development to provide the materials innovations that our customers need. We have a strong pipeline of differentiated enabling technologies that are winning in the marketplace and extending our innovation leadership.","Third, we\u2019ve increased our focus on advanced service products. We are delivering more value to our customers, and as a result, our service business is growing to record levels.","Fourth, we are successfully applying materials engineering beyond semiconductor. In display, we\u2019re on track to deliver more than $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2016 with significant opportunities for future growth.","I\u2019ll now provide our market outlook. In our discussions with customers, they describe near and longer-term drivers for their business that support sustainable growth and investments. These include increasing silicon content in smartphones to support advanced features, explosive growth of data for social media, 4K video, and IoT, that\u2019s fueling demand for memory.","And most exciting of all, emerging categories, such as virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and smart vehicles that create new platforms that demand high-performance computing, advanced memory, and better displays. Within this environment, we see customers battling for leadership and making strategic investments to ensure, they\u2019re in winning positions as demand shifts to these new device technologies. This is especially true in memory, where we see a broad base of customers accelerating their 3D NAND road maps.","As a result, NAND investment is getting stronger and we now anticipate that spending in 2016 will be 40% higher than last year. We\u2019re also seeing foundry investments strengthening and now expect spending for the year to be 5% to 10% higher than in 2015. While more than half of the spending is focused on leading edge 10 and 7-nanometer technologies. The foundry customer mix is broadening, as investments in trailing geometries increase, particularly in China.","In logic, we now believe 2016 spending will be marginally lower than 2015. And in DRAM, we still see spending coming down, at least, 25% from the very high levels of investment last year. Overall, we now expect 2016 wafer fab equipment investment to be slightly above 2015, and as we look further ahead, our early view is that 2017 could be higher. I will now talk about the progress we\u2019re making in each of our major businesses.","In semiconductor, we see strong demand across the Board. Our quarterly orders and revenue are a 15-year high. And for fiscal 2016, we expect our revenue will be around $770 million higher than 2015. This gives me high confidence that this will be a strong shared gain year for us. What I\u2019m most excited about is our pipeline of innovative new products. Two great examples are the products we launched last month.","Our Selectra system is the industry\u2019s first extreme selectivity etch tool. This disruptive etch technology enables precision materials removal that does not damage the increasingly delicate structures in advanced logic and memory devices. Selectra has great customer poll and we see significant growth in applications at future technology nodes.","By the end of the year, we expect to have shipped more than 350 chambers to a broad set of customers. I\u2019m equally excited about our PROVision system, which is the industry\u2019s most advanced e-beam inspection tool. E-beam is the fastest-growing segment in the inspection market. The market doubled in size from 2011 to 2015 and is set for significant future growth. We see very strong demand for PROVision and have already shipped more than a dozen systems.","In service, our strategy is to deliver more value to customers with advanced service products that are focused on improving device performance, yield, and cost. Our team is doing a great job. In the third quarter, revenues were at an all-time high. When we look at year-on-year comparisons, we have grown our service business for 11 consecutive quarters.","In display, our capabilities in large area materials engineering set us apart and we have tremendous momentum. The major display inflections are made possible by materials innovation and our available market is expanding significantly. We are in the initial phase of OLED investments and this opportunity is layered on top of solid demand for our leadership display products for TV and mobile. As a result, for the second quarter in a row, orders and display are at an all-time record.","Looking further ahead, we\u2019re increasingly excited about DR and AR, as it has broad implications, not only for display, but also for semiconductor. Leading companies in Silicon Valley and around the world are making big investments in this area, and our technologists are engaged with them as they develop their roadmaps. We will spend more time covering this topic at our Analyst Meeting in September.","In summary, I strongly believe this is Applied\u2019s time. We are performing better than ever delivering new records, and in a great position to sustainably outperform our markets. There are combination of factors that are contributing to our success. We identified large multi-year inflections early. We are making great progress with the major elements of our strategy, enabling us to unlock the full potential of Applied. We\u2019ve made significant investments in our capabilities and products to extend our innovation leadership and we are executing well across the organization.","Now, let me hand the call over to Bob, who\u2019ll provide more details about our quarterly results and performance. Bob?","Bob Halliday","Thanks, Gary. In Q3, Applied demonstrated that we are growing faster than our markets and accelerating our profitability. We delivered the company\u2019s highest earnings per share surpassing our record set more than 15 years ago. Gary talked about the strategies that are helping us to anticipate major inflections, deliver more valuable products and services and grow in attractive new markets.","I\u2019ll describe some of the benefits that our strategies and execution are having on our financial performance. And I\u2019ll do this by comparing our most recent quarter to Q2 of 2011. I think this is an interesting comparison, because Q2 of 2011 was our best quarter since 2000, because revenue was nearly the same in both periods. Under our new strategy, we\u2019ve increased our semiconductor systems revenue by 23% to the highest level in 15 years.","We\u2019ve put our services business on a growth trajectory and increased our display net sales by over 50%. We have significantly reduced our investment in solar, which is down from 22% of revenue to only 2% today. And we\u2019ve increased our non-GAAP gross margin by 1.8 points. We\u2019ve also cut our tax rate and reduced our share count.","As a result of these and other improvements, we delivered a 32% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter versus Q2 of 2011. And we did this while investing 30% more in R&D. In short, we demonstrated momentum in Q3 delivering higher earnings power at similar revenue even while investing significantly more in new products for future growth. And today, our momentum is accelerating.","In Q3, we generated record orders of $3.7 billion and we now have record backlog of $4.9 billion. We\u2019ve grown our semiconductor orders and backlog to the highest level in 15 years, and our display orders and backlog to the highest level ever. We\u2019ve grown our service orders by 9% year-over-year and our backlog by 18% year-over-year. We\u2019re also making excellent progress towards our 2018 financial model. We\u2019re approaching our targets for revenue across semiconductor, services, and display.","Today, we feel even more confident that we can hit or exceed our goal for WFE market share. We\u2019re making additional progress in gross margin coming in at the high-end of Q3 expectations. We\u2019re improving our efficiency even as we significantly increase R&D funding for new products.","In fact, we\u2019ve reduced our OpEx to sales ratio to the lowest level in five years. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 3.6 points this quarter to 22.8%, which is the highest in five years. We\u2019ve made further progress with our tax structure. If our geographic sales patterns continue, we now believe that we can sustain a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.5%.","We achieved our share count objective ahead of schedule. And we remained opportunistic with the buyback program, repurchasing 9 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $21.88. I hope you\u2019ll join us for the Analyst Meeting, where I\u2019ll give you more insights into our progress and momentum.","Next, I\u2019ll explain our segment reporting changes. Effective in Q3, we expanded our Display segment to include roll-to-roll web coating systems, which were previously in ES. The segment is now called Display and Adjacent Markets. We\u2019ve also moved display equipment upgrades from AGS to display. These changes will enable us to realize technology market and management synergies.","Applied\u2019s remaining solar business is now included in corporate and other and we no longer report ES as a segment. The Semiconductor Systems segment is unchanged and 200 millimeter equipment continues to be included in AGS. Our earnings release includes the information you\u2019ll need for your models.","Here are some of our segment highlights for Q3. We grew semiconductor systems revenue to the highest level in 15 years. We increased the non-GAAP operating margin by more than 5 points sequentially to 31.1%, which is the highest level in four years. In Applied Global Services, we set a new revenue record of $657 million. In display, we recorded record orders of $803 million with more than half coming from projects in China. Compared to last quarter, we increased display revenue by 67% and display operating margin by 3.5 points to 20.1%.","Moving to the balance sheet, we generated $981 million of cash from operations. Profitability and cash flow management were stronger in the quarter and our year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.7 billion, or 22% of sales. In the quarter, operating cash flow was 35% of sales.","Now, I\u2019ll provide our fourth quarter guidance. We expect our overall net sales to be up by 15% to 19%, sequentially. Within this revenue outlook, we expect semiconductor systems to be up by 19% to 23%, sequentially, AGS should be up by 3% to 6%, and display should be up by 30% to 40%.","On a year-over-year basis, each of our businesses is on track for strong quarterly revenue growth. Using the midpoints of our Q4 guidance, we forecast that semiconductor systems revenue will be up by 45% year-over-year, with AGS up 12%, display up 80%, and the total company up 39%.","We expect Q4 non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $600 million plus or minus $10 million and lower as a percentage of sales. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.69. This earnings guidance represents a new record for the company and a doubling of last year\u2019s Q4 performance.","In closing, I believe our momentum is sustainable. Let me explain why? Our Q4 guidance reflects how uniquely well-positioned the company is a major inflections, including in 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, 3D NAND, OLED and the Chinese market. While customer spending patterns will continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter, we are growing faster than our markets and accelerating our profitability. And we\u2019re just beginning to see the positive effects of a stronger product pipeline and better execution across the company.","Based on customer polls for our products and services, I believe we\u2019ll have strong orders in Q4 of 2016 and Q1 of 2017. And while it\u2019s too early to know our earnings in Q1 of 2017, I believe we can double our Q1 non-GAAP EPS year-over-year.","Now, let me turn the call over to Mike for questions.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please limit yourself to one question and feel free to reach you later if you have any additional questions. Let\u2019s please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Tim Arcuri","Thank you very much. So guys, obviously, great, great quarter, and obviously big opportunity in display. I guess, I want to ask a question on SSG. So if I take the orders you booked last quarter and I take this quarters orders, it\u2019s about $4.2 billion. And if I use your SSG share model of roughly 22%, that implies that the overall WFE market is sort of run rating in the first-half of roughly $40 billion.","So that begs the conclusion either this year is pretty front-half loaded or you guys are gaining a lot more share and that you\u2019re going to end the year quite a bit higher than 22%, and it has to be several hundred basis points higher than 22%. So, I guess, I\u2019m wondering if you can comment on whether the numbers imply that the year is a little front-half loaded, or whether it\u2019s just implies that you\u2019re gaining that much share? Thanks.","Bob Halliday","Sure. Tim, let me see if I can help. In terms of the loading of the year, historically what you see is that the foundry is particularly good and kind of calendar Q \u2013 end of Q1, Q2 in terms of shipments, I\u2019m doing shipments and bookings is close for them. And then this year, though, it was later in the year as you remember, so we\u2019ve been strong in foundry as they\u2019re wrapping things like 10 and early 7. And then memory was stronger in the beginning of this year.","So if you look at Applied, specifically, we benefited earlier in the year, because we\u2019ve gained share in memory. We\u2019ve gained share in DRAM. We\u2019ve gained share in NAND, and that kept us strong. For instance, historically, the last couple of years, we were about 38%, 40% for full-year numbers for foundry, but we were only about 37% in Q2. We\u2019re up over 50% now in foundry in Q4 and Q1, okay. So what you\u2019re seeing is, we\u2019re betting from secular improvement in Applied, but also some seasonal strengthening in foundry. So both things are working for us.","So we will gain share this year pretty significant, we don\u2019t want to say the specific number. In terms of WFE, the $40 billion run rate, I don\u2019t think WFE is that high, I think we\u2019re having some strength now. Last quarter, we said it was sort of $31.6 million plus, and this quarters it\u2019s probably up close to $32.6 million my guess.","But what you\u2019re seeing is secular gains for Applied across, particularly memory, strong positions in foundry, and also the China thing is helping us, a lot of things are working for us, that secular stuff is working for us, and also the seasonality in foundry is helping in the next couple of quarters.","Gary Dickerson","I guess, what I\u2019d add also is that in 10 and 7-nanometer foundry, we have \u2013 while our TAM is growing significantly, if you look at those two nodes together about 30%. And we have the initial adoption of many new platforms. We\u2019re actually winning more market share also in 10 and 7-nanometer, and we\u2019re still in the early innings of some of these new platforms that are being adopted, the Selectra product, the Olympia, PROVision, LK Prime, Precision CVD, very, very strong adoption of those new platforms.","And then in memory, as Bob talked about, we\u2019re gaining share in memory. And especially in 3D NAND, 3D NAND is materials-enabled, not litho-enabled. So our TAM is expanding significantly, and there also we have many new innovative products, including the Sym3, which is the fastest ramping product in history of the company. So overall, this is going to be a great share gain year for Applied Materials and we\u2019re incredibly well-positioned going forward.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Romit Shah","Thank you and yes congratulations on the excellent results. Bob, you mentioned that you expected orders to remain strong in Q4 and Q1. Does that mean that, we shouldn\u2019t expect orders to decline from these levels. And I was hoping you could talk specifically around your expectations for display orders seeing them at $800 million here?","Bob Halliday","Sure. We \u2013 I think at the end of last call, when we had orders in Q2 of 3.451 billion that I said our orders would sustain and that we would continue to have strong orders. In fact, we beat this order with $3.658 billion, $36 billion, $37 billion. I think Q4 and Q1 are both pretty strong. I\u2019m not sure that quite as strong as we were the last two quarters. But they\u2019re bigger than probably any quarter we had last year, yes, it\u2019s going to be pretty big still. So, it\u2019s probably to have a 3 handle on it, frankly.","Operator","And your next question comes from Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks for taking my question. I just have a quick one. In terms of 2017 outlook, Gary, you mentioned that the WFE is expected to be up year-on-year. Can you just provide us some color in terms of the overall spending by the transition system in terms of flat memory versus foundry, and on NAND, if you see those \u2013 how you see they\u2019re expanding in those segment and also for display?","Bob Halliday","So, this is Bob, I can kick it off and then Gary could jump in, too. In terms of this year, what you see is trends that are helping us a lot frankly. You see strong spending in NAND, whereas last year NAND was about, and I\u2019ll go into 2017 for you too. In 2015 rather, NAND was about 6.8, this year it\u2019s up 40% to 45%, about 9.7. And that is 90% for V-NAND. What we see next year is, NAND is going to be up a little more actually, and is going to be like 98% V-NAND, and our position is very strong.","In fact, some of the share gains we\u2019re seeing this year, you didn\u2019t quite see them last year, because last year was about 50% 2D, and our gains are really strong on the transition to 3D. So that will continue for us next year. So NAND up some next year, almost all being in our position very strong.","In terms of foundry, we think foundry could be p flat-to-up 5% next year. We think it\u2019s going to be very good for us in the leading edge, and we also think it\u2019s going to be good for us in the trailing edge in China and things like that.","DRAM, we think it could be up a little bit. This year it was down 25% to 30%, I think maybe 25% we said on the call. Next year, it maybe up a little bit, but it\u2019s the smallest of our numbers pretty much now except for logics or less, so it\u2019s about 5.9 this year, up a little bit next year. And then logic is probably up a little bit next year also. So overall, we see an opportunity to go up some next year. But it\u2019s a particular place for us around NAND and foundry.","And the second thing you asked about was display. Display CapEx you guys don\u2019t follow it closely. 2015 display CapEx and there\u2019s not as good as estimates, but we think it\u2019s little over $8 billion maybe. This year, it could be around $14.5 billion. We think next year continues at similar numbers, maybe a little bit more.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Your line is now open.","Stephen Chin","Thanks. Hi, Gary, Bob, also congrats on the results. My question is on the memory orders. So the memory orders declined pretty meaningfully in the July quarter. I was just wondering if you think that was just timing related, or do you think it\u2019s a function of the more rational spend by customers, and could we see a snapback in memory orders in the October quarter? Thanks.","Bob Halliday","Yes. So the \u2013 I think that stuff is lumpy. We still see very strong demand for customers, particularly around V-NAND stuff. So we had a huge number in Q2 for V-NAND, because people frankly want to get in our production queue.","In Q3, we have reasonable NAND orders, but not as big as they were in Q2. So I\u2019d say, the demand is still strong. We\u2019re getting a lot of pull in NAND still, and I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the orders lumpiness.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, I think the demand for 3D NAND is certainly extremely strong. Customers can sell everything that they can build. And if you look at where we\u2019re at in terms of that transition to 3D NAND, we\u2019re still not that far along in the overall transition. And so, every customer is moving as fast as they can from planer to 3D. And so, our thinking for 3D NAND going forward is still very strong certainly in 2017 still very strong.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Atif Malik","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a good quarter. Bob, on the gross margins, I understand that great job from Q2 of 2011. But if I compare it to your 2018 financial model like flat gross margins versus 44.6% at 33.5% in WFE, a little bit below that mark. What will get us \u2013 what will get the gross margins higher from these levels? I understand the display mix helps the gross margins, but the foundry mix helps them?","Bob Halliday","Sure. I think, we\u2019re actually making progress. I thought earlier in the year, we would stay sort of flat to last year were up a little bit. Last year was 42.9, we were about 43.2. And this was a particularly strong year for display and also etch very well to.","Now, let me just say display and etch are adding a lot to the operating profits of the company. Their model is a little bit different. For instance, display has a little lower gross margin, very comparable as they mature operating margin profile. And then etch has significantly grown their operating profit for the company over the last several years. And their operating margins have gone up a fair amount.","In terms of the specific question of 44.6, we said we\u2019d do 44.6 in 2018. If you took, I think, I said last quarter, if you took the mix we had and if you took the gross margins we had by individual product and compared it to 2014 mix, we\u2019re like 44.7. This quarter we did the same analysis, we\u2019re like 44.9.","So we\u2019re beating it if the mix didn\u2019t change, what we\u2019re facing is mix. We can offset a bunch of the mix. I don\u2019t know if we can offset all of it. So I think we\u2019ll make progress to the 44.6 next three years, there was a 44.6 was a 2018 number? Where we get there? I\u2019m not quite sure, because of X, but I feel very good about the top line, the gross profit dollars, the operating profit and the EPS of the company, the main issue is just the mix on the gross margin, because things like cost reduction are doing well, our negotiations are doing well. It\u2019s just the mix is the issue. And the operating margin don\u2019t \u2013 doesn\u2019t get impact as much as the gross margin with those businesses.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Atif.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar","Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the gross margin question. With the second-half with more foundry logic investments coming up with 10-nanometer, I was under the assumption that should be extremely positive for your gross margin profile. So I\u2019m just curious if that is going to be more back-half loaded and into 2017, should we, at least, expect gross margins to improve into the fiscal Q1, given that it\u2019s flat in fiscal Q4? Thank you.","Bob Halliday","They might depends on the mix. Remember in Q3 and Q4, we\u2019ve been growing a lot very strong in terms of revenues for both display and our etch business and memory, for instance. So if in Q1, we probably are going to be strong pretty much across the Board.","So foundry, I think, has a potential to be strong. But I also think we\u2019ll be strong in display and probably in revenues in memory, because some of the revenues we ship into NAND in Japan are delayed about a after the shipment. So my guess is a little bit of upside opportunity in Q1, but I don\u2019t want to be too specific now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","Hey, guys, congratulations on the solid quarterly results and execution. Another focus by the market on display has been on OLED, but it seems like even in the core or large screen LCD segment, there\u2019s a lot of Board opportunity. There\u2019s still a lot of focus on 4K UHD. I think one of your peers recently in their call talked about three customers that have plans for gen 10.5 LCD plan investments in the not too distant future. So I\u2019m just wondering, if you\u2019re trying to see that in your pipeline? And is it something that you would expect orders for this year, or is this something more kind of 2017, 2018 timeframe?","Bob Halliday","Yes, I\u2019ll start and Gary can jump in. Actually, the core display orders for LCDs and related TVs have held up probably a little better than we thought and it looks like there might be an opportunity there. Now, what\u2019s the big inflection is the OLED stuff. But I do agree with you that the LCD and the TV stuffs held up a little better than we expected.","Gary Dickerson","I guess, I could also add that display is a great opportunity for Applied Materials. We\u2019re still in the early innings and this smartphone transition to OLED. And the display is a key differentiator for mobile devices. So in the near-term, near-term being over the next couple of years, this is going to be a great driver for us.","If we think longer-term, we also see large technology companies making huge investments in new areas like VR, AR, and automotive, where display can be significant. We\u2019re also developing new innovative products that will significantly expand our served market over the next several years. So normalized spending in display could be higher than in the past and also our TAM is expanding on top of that.","And last thing on this one, I\u2019d like to say is that, really the display is an example of where we can take materials engineering into a new market and adjacent market and Applied is really unique in our ability to enable this big inflection and drive growth. So really overall great, great opportunity for the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much and also congratulations. Gary, as you look at the 3D NAND market share gains you have made to-date, which process segments do you believe you\u2019ve made the most gains? And as the industry goes to say 64 layers and higher, where do you see incremental gains for the company on a going-forward basis?","Gary Dickerson","So I think the most important thing for people to think about on 3D NAND is that, this is an materials-enabled inflection, not litho-enabled. And it\u2019s a biggest change in memory technology in decades. So when you think materials-enabled, it really the products that we have targeted for 3D NAND, the Sym3 etch tool is the fastest ramp we\u2019ve ever had for any system in Applied Materials, and we\u2019re still in the early innings.","One of the things that I believe is that, we can grow as fast as we can qualify. We have so much pull from customers on Sym3. There\u2019s still an opportunity for growth there. Our CVD business is growing significantly. This year, we expect strong revenue growth in CVD gaining several points of overall share very, very strong position in 3D NAND. So that\u2019s another area where when you look at the 64 layers or you\u2019re going forward, there is a tremendous opportunity.","The number of CMP steps also double in maybe 2 even in some cases 3X number of CMP stuffs. So that\u2019s another area, where we have really, really a great position. And this is the first time also for us to introduce Epi into a memory device. So there are a number of different areas, where we have innovative platforms, innovative new products, and really tremendous pull from customers that give us a great opportunity as 3D NAND goes forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest. Your line is now open.","Weston Twigg","Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just \u2013 I just wanted to touch on the logic spending being down this year, wondering why you think it\u2019s down if that\u2019s related to slowing node transitions, and just maybe gauge your conviction in it being up next year, like you commented. And if the softness is related to slowing node transitions, so I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment on any risk that that spills over into the Foundry segment?","Bob Halliday","Yes. We have \u2013 the numbers we have now, remember we have in logic, we have a major U.S. company and also some Japanese companies and things like that. So our numbers show, it\u2019s down 5% to 10% this year, and up 5% flat to 5% next year. Let me pull up the detail.","Gary Dickerson","So let me take the second part of that while Bob is pulling up the information on the \u2013 on logic. Relative to foundry, what we see is that, all of our customers, all of our customers are targeting 7-nanometer as a big node, very big node. There\u2019s a lot of customers \u2013 their customers that are taping out. And so that is a big opportunity and every single one of our customers are in a race to be in the right position as that node ramps.","So the pull we\u2019re getting for customers on 10\/7 is extremely strong. And as Bob said earlier, we see strong business in the trailing nodes also in foundry. And we see that, China being a big part of that, but we see that also continuing going forward in the future.","So, at least, from what we\u2019re seeing today, our customers in terms of advanced foundry and also relative to the trailing nodes in foundry, it looks like and what customers are saying is that, the business will be good for the next few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Joseph Moore","Great. Thank you. Bob, I think your comments are making good progress towards the 2018 model where you stated, your Silicon Systems business is kind of approaching the size that you talked about for 2018 on the type of WFE number that sort of midpoint that you talk about. So is that \u2013 are you doing better earlier, because you\u2019re taking more market share at the TAM expanding faster, could you just talk about that? And if obviously, we\u2019ll wait till next month to get the full forecast, but any thoughts on will that continue to move higher from here on both share and TAM? Thanks.","Bob Halliday","Yes, on the semi stuff, two things have really compounded for us. So and in fairness to us, we kind of predicted, that\u2019s what we\u2019re positioned. But one, the market changes have really come out frankly as we expected in terms of the transition from 2D to 3D, and also the products they need and the transition on foundry has been going that way. And also China has helped somewhat, and we\u2019ve always been strong in China we kept our strength there. So those market inflections in semi and also we\u2019ll talk about display market inflections. We kind of had a pretty good feel for those coming, but we didn\u2019t have exactly the right products there.","So we strengthened our product positions in places like etch, CVD, ALD inspection, we\u2019re going to be talking about more, because we think you need more and more of that particularly e-beam, as you get through foundry and logic and places like that. So it\u2019s a compounding of the market turned out pretty close to what we expected, and we have the right products there.","And the reason you\u2019re seeing acceleration this year, frankly, is the market inflections are happening this year. For instance, this year you\u2019re seeing a big spend increase in NAND and it\u2019s 90% V-NAND, that\u2019s where the share opportunities are. And we\u2019re seeing a fair amount of spending in 10 and 7, were strong, interestingly OLED spending in display. And we\u2019ve introduced new products in each one of those markets to capitalize on it. So, we\u2019re probably ahead of plan, frankly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Co. Your line is now open.","Edwin Mok","Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, I guess, I have a question about sustainability of or how sustainable this ramp of multiple areas. And I guess, it specifically relate to customer concentration. So it seems like leading edge foundry 10\/7-nanometer foundry and also OLED are big drivers now or definitely a big driver for you this last quarter you said those are sustainable.","So I was wondering, are you seeing like broadening or increased number of customer, both from leading edge 10\/7 in foundry, as well as got the increased number of display customers are all placing order for OLED, or just still concentrate at one or two customer of those \u2013 just that those customer aggressively ramping? That\u2019s all I have. Thanks.","Bob Halliday","I\u2019ll start and Gary can jump in again. So there are several inflections we\u2019ve noted. One is NAND, one is OLED, one is China, and the other one which is going on right now is foundry leading edge, in particular, so let me speak to those. NAND is \u2013 there\u2019s about $1.4 million wafer starts in the world, by the end of this year, it\u2019s going to be about 400,000 transition to V-NAND.","We think the vast majority of those get transition for many reasons. We think the spending on NAND probably is up next year and our position is strong. And we think that that transition remains strong for a number of years and plays very well for us. We think in OLED, they\u2019re in pretty early innings on the transition to OLED on the phones. In fact, the orders we\u2019re showing that we\u2019ve been booking and we have some more to come, those things will ship through 2017 and to early 2018.","So we\u2019re going to see reverence for that for a while and that\u2019s just what we\u2019ve been booking, okay. And we believe there\u2019s more down the road, okay. So this OLED transition is going to go on for a while and we have enriched the opportunity for us by developing new products there just as we have in semi.","In terms of China as an inflection, I mean, just listening to the Chinese government, they\u2019re in this for a long-term and their interest in investing in the semiconductor is probably only going to increase, okay, and our position is strong.","And then finally, the foundry one you asked about, Edwin, which is particularly focused on. Right now, the leading edge is strong and it\u2019s strong into early next year, and that one does have some seasonality. But if you look at the longer-term trends there and just listen to the voice of our biggest customer, about 50% of their growth is going to be come from more features in phones, and about 50% is everything else that you see in Silicon Valley, whether it\u2019s a autonomous cars, virtual reality, machine learning, AI, all these things are driving about 50%.","And it isn\u2019t just one big thing, it\u2019s a whole slew of things. And I think we\u2019re going to do at Investor Day a very interesting discussion about virtual reality and not just what it drives in display, but what it drives in memory and what it drives in advanced processors. So in foundry on the leading edge, it isn\u2019t just phones. 50% of leading edge customers is content in phones going up, but 50% is all those other stuff which you can see, okay.","Now, in terms of the other things going on in foundry is the trailing edge is very strong and that\u2019s kind of a China phenomenon, but there\u2019s also the content in phone when you\u2019re talking about all the cameras and sensors and things like that. So I think, foundry is in pretty good shape next year. And I think it\u2019s got probably more sustainability overall than people said a few years ago.","In terms of other companies at the leading edge, I think others will need \u2013 want to compete, because it\u2019s a big market they want to be at the leading edge. And the timing and magnitude of the spending on that we haven\u2019t disclosed.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Edwin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sidney Ho","Hi, thanks, and congratulations on very strong orders. I think, you have two consecutive quarters in China over $800 million of orders. I understand that some of that comes from display. I think, Bob, you mentioned display was half of the orders this quarter from China?","So if you back that out, do you feel that the $400 million to $500 million per quarter of order run rate is the base case now and start moving up from here, or do you think there\u2019s still some lumpiness in orders in China?.And have you seen much order activities from local foundries, or are they mostly still coming from the multinationals at this point?","Gary Dickerson","Sure. Well, again, we have a strong semi business in China and a strong display business. So I do display first. We see the trends where the Chinese are heavily invested in display business and want to share there, probably continuing for a number of years. They are not heavily into OLED yet, but their interest in display is very strong.","In terms of semi, the government has obviously said, their interest is very strong and sustainable. So that I think that you may have lumpiness, but I think you\u2019ve raised the baseline, particularly in semi and the display baseline has already been going up for a while now. So I think that you\u2019re going to see pretty sustainably strong orders in China.","Bob Halliday","Yes, let me add on this one. We\u2019re in a very strong position with both multinational and domestic companies. Relative to share, China is one of the strongest regions for Applied Materials. Relative to the investment, you hear the word strategic when you think about China, there\u2019s a focus on growing the percentage of domestic content and building a secure supply chain.","And as Bob said, there has been announcements around huge investments over the next decade in China. So again, we\u2019re in a very strong position. We think this is a multi-year wave. Certainly, we see strong growth in 2016, but we think it\u2019s a great growth opportunity also going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Your line is now open.","Craig Ellis","Yes, congratulations on the results and outlook and thanks for sneaking me in. I wanted to switch from a more model intensive question maybe two or more qualitative question. Bob it was helpful to get a lot of the longer-term context on the financial performance of the business.","And the question as we look at the ability of the company to redirect to some new opportunities like OLED is. Relative to the longer-term history of the company, where do you think the product development engine is? And how much further upside do you have, as we look ahead for SAM expansive type of products that would be on the roadmap? Thank you.","Bob Halliday","That\u2019s a really good question. Let me just spend a couple of minutes, if you don\u2019t mind. If you go look at it, our guide for Q3 was frankly significantly north of the street. I think we guided to $0.48 and the streets three months ago was at $0.36. Now, we\u2019re guiding to about $0.65, roughly, and the street was $0.48. And now we\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to \u2013 we have 3.5, almost $3.5 billion of orders last quarter, almost $3.7 billion this quarter. Next two quarters, we\u2019re hoping to have around three each.","So there\u2019s something\u2019s changed here. So the question you\u2019re really asking is, what\u2019s changed disruptively either in the market or at Applied Materials? I think there\u2019s really three answers. One, I think the market has changed and it really has in terms of what type of equipment people need to make leading edge devices and leading edge displays.","For instance, in 2012, 53.5% of the CapEx WFE spending by semi customers was in places, where we competed. Now, this year we think it\u2019s 63.5%. And in those markets, where we compete in semi, we\u2019re gaining share where we had weaker share.","So in the market changes to make leading edge devices they need to buy different sets of leading edge equipment. And frankly, they need from very strong big capable suppliers, because the problems are just getting harder. They\u2019re putting things in the production earlier than ever before and ramping faster. In display, you say the same thing, make an OLED display is harder to make an LCD display.","So having the right products, we\u2019re introducing new products. So in the marketplace, there has been big inflections V-NAND devices totally different architecture. So big inflections number one in the market. But number two, the products are very well-positioned now for us. So I can see it is going on for a while.","Now, the third thing is, well, how you\u2019re doing at Applied? I honestly believe that we will all grow by several points the markets in which we\u2019re competing. You might be saying, well, how can you possibly know that for several reasons.","One, we defined the financial model here right. The spending we put into products is significantly more than we used to relative to our total spending. So we invest more than we used to in product versus just maintain the lights in the building and operating the place.","So the investment relatively speaking is heavier in product development and the batting average on new products is going up. We\u2019ve put 50% more technical guys in the field, I think, who\u2019ve invested in R&D and the products we\u2019re coming out with are not not just iterative products, they\u2019re disruptive innovative products. And if you go and get leading edge, logic and foundry customers,the number of DQR positions we have. The number of new platforms we have. We\u2019ve changed the model, the investment model, and the batting average on the new products.","And the other reason, I\u2019m pretty confident, I can see the products coming down the pipe. So I think that Applied is going to outgrow the markets that we compete in for the next several years, 5, 10 years, now I can\u2019t see. For the next number of years, I feel good about where we\u2019re investing, how we\u2019re executing in the market opportunities.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, I guess, let me add to this one. The fundamental driver for our businesses today from a market standpoint is materials innovation. So if you look at 3D NAND, its materials-enabled scaling. If you look at how people are trying to solve etch placement errors in litho, there\u2019s a lot of materials innovation that can dramatically reduce etch placement errors, and that\u2019s a big deal for our customers going forward in multi-patterning.","And so that\u2019s the core competency of Applied Materials. We\u2019re broader, deeper, have more competencies, more technology, more talent than anyone in the world. And relative to semi, you see today, we\u2019re in the early adoption of some great innovative products, not incremental products, innovative products. And the pipeline we have there is also tremendous. We have great products in the pipeline.","If you look at display, Applied is unique and our ability to take these technologies into large areas and into new markets. And we\u2019ve also innovated with new TAM growth. Thin film encapsulation is an example, where we have hundreds of millions of dollars in business enabling the transition to organic LED and mobile. And we have other capabilities they\u2019re also in the pipeline that are as significant relative to growth drivers for us longer-term outside the semiconductor industry.","So this is personally what I love about Applied. This is what where I love to spend my time. The company has so much talent, so much capability. I really believe that we\u2019re still in the early innings relative to innovation in semi, in materials-enabled scaling, with disruptive new platforms, and also outside the semiconductor business into adjacent markets.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","And your next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter, guys. I guess my question is on the gross margin trajectory as you guys see from here for the next few quarters. It seems like a lot of the growth drivers you\u2019ve talked about on display or in CVD and etch. It seems like they might be somewhat headwinds to your gross margin expansion.","So can you just maybe talk about what are the offsets of the leverage you might have to negate the mix headwinds and enable the margin expansion as you go forward from here over the next few quarters?","Bob Halliday","Sure, there\u2019s several things. One is the cost reduction, which is the best we\u2019ve done in years. The second one is, we just hammer away at every single product to get better and offset the mix that might be a little harder. And then the third one is continuing it through disruptive products.","For instance, we think we\u2019re going to grow our inspection business in terms of market share this year and probably next year, and we have new products coming out, and those products tend to be strong gross margins. So we do have \u2013 we have mix that\u2019s pushing back us a little bit, but we have other things that could cover that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Thanks for squeezing me in. I have a very short question for Gary. You talked about display CapEx kind of flattish next year. In that context, I see the growth for AMAT coming from share gain, especially in capsulation. When do you think we\u2019re going to learn more about this? Is it something that you\u2019re going to discuss at Analyst Day, or are we going to learn more as those share gains are materialized?","Bob Halliday","Thanks for the question, Mehdi. Yes, we will definitely talk more about display at the Analyst Meeting. And really also focus on some of these longer-term opportunities, where some very large technology companies are making huge investments and where we have great opportunities in display going forward. So we definitely will cover that in more detail at the Analyst Day.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Mehdi.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is now open.","Jagadish Iyer","Yes, thanks for taking my question. So if I look at your display revenues growing about well over 50% year-over-year in calendar 2016 versus calendar 2015, what percentage has come from OLED? And how should we think about it as we look at calendar 2017?","Bob Halliday","Sure. The revenue growth has been obviously very strong, and the bookings we have, we believe we have momentum into 2017 on the revenue line. If you look at the bookings the share in display, they\u2019ve been probably about two-thirds or more around OLED and about one-third roughly around LCD stuff.","So then if you look at the revenue split, it\u2019s probably about 30%, 40% LCD and about 60% OLED this year. So last year was probably closer to two-thirds LCD, I think, and one-third are not too big OLED. And here it is, yes, it\u2019s probably at 70% last year was LCD, so it\u2019s flipped. So it was 70%, 30% one way last year and this year it\u2019s probably 60%, 40% roughly 65%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jerome Ramel with Exane BNP. Your line is now open.","Jerome Ramel","Yes, thank you for taking my question. What kind of capacity are you modeling for 10-nanometer node and 7-nanometer node in foundry going forward? Total installed capacity with start amounts?","Bob Halliday","Yes, so capital intensity 10-nanometer is up over 25% from 16\/14. And at 7, we think it\u2019s up again, but we haven\u2019t set a specific number yet.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, Bob was referring to our TAM opportunity, and I think the combination 10, 7 something like 30% somewhere in that range.","Bob Halliday","Yes, I think it\u2019s actually more than 30%.","Gary Dickerson","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Charles on for Toshiya, thank you for taking the call, and congrats on a great quarter. You guys, given that you guys seem to be firing on all cylinders. What are maybe a couple idiosyncratic risks that we should be monitoring?","Bob Halliday","Well, that\u2019s a good question. Let\u2019s think. Where we\u2019ve\u2026","Gary Dickerson","I think for us we have tremendous opportunities. The key for us, I really do believe, we can grow as fast as we can qualify. We have great platforms, where we\u2019re totally targeted on major inflections very, very innovative products, where we have tremendous customer pull. So I think the tension for us really is to make sure that we can qualify with customers, work with customers, because there\u2019s just incredible pull for us in a number of different areas.","So I would say that, we for sure are going to grow share. The rate of that growth is really up to us relative from an execution perspective.","Bob Halliday","Yes, maybe I\u2019ll pile on a little bit. You always have, it\u2019s not idiosyncratic the macro risk, which I think is moderate, but that\u2019s a risk. I think the other one to add what Gary said, there has really been a change in my opinion at Applied that we didn\u2019t have as much growth stuff being considered a few years ago.","So we have really built a funnel of great ideas with customers, customers are pulling for us big time now. So our issue is how do we optimize all the opportunities. So it\u2019s like how good can we be and that\u2019s a tension we have every single day, which projects do we follow up, which ones we push faster, which ones so becomes how many different things we realize how fast. So it\u2019s optimizing the portfolio really.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Charles. And Shawn, we\u2019ve got time for maybe two more questions, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Tim Arcuri","Thanks a lot. Gary, I\u2019m just looking at these numbers and I\u2019m sitting here listening to you talk about all the market share gains. And I guess I just wanted to give you a chance to sort of talk about how this has happened, because was some of this in the pipeline before the Tokyo Electron merger, or did the merger fall apart and you just completely decided to totally reposition the company. And I guess just give us a sense of sort of the genesis of this success to maybe help people deconstruct how this might look going forward? Thank you.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, thanks for the question. So we focus on big inflections where and I think Bob talked about this earlier. We could see the big inflections a few years in advance and we made a decision that we would shift hundreds of millions of dollars in spending in the company.","So we cut G&A a significant amount. We significantly dramatically reduced our spending in solar. And all of those \u2013 all of that money we shifted keeping OpEx relatively flat into areas, where we have great opportunities Applied has great talent and great competencies and great technologies, but we needed to make the investments and fuel the growth.","So that happened, frankly, maybe three or four years ago, where we started that shifting of resources and really focused in the areas where we knew that we had great opportunities. We also have added talent into the company to help us execute on those opportunities. And that\u2019s really the playbook and I would \u2013 we\u2019re still driving that playbook today.","So I look at the semiconductor business in the pipeline. We have some phenomenally valuable and disruptive products still in the pipeline, where we have great opportunities going forward. And also outside semi, we have some great opportunities that are sizable opportunities, where we can still drive growth for the company.","So those are the things we did. It wasn\u2019t something that frankly with the Tokyo Electron merger, we kept our eye on the ball, we were laser focused on these opportunities. All through that process and we were ready basically when these inflections were ramping with the right products and the right team to execute. Bob, if you want to add anything.","Bob Halliday","I think that\u2019s true. I think you have two-part question there, Tim. One is, how come the stuff so apparent now? And two, did Tokyo Electron have any impact or at the end of the merger have an impact? I think the answer to the first question is, if you\u2019re going to gain share in an equipment business like ours with the semi display, the opportunity is on inflections, big changes in how they make chips or they make displays.","And you\u2019ve got to have the right product that inflection or change an older or new OLED device. So you can look at stuff, we even did in the public domain. There were a number of people who said that, we should be less aggressive investing in display and solar. We decided there were two very different business models and so we increased our investment display, because we saw the inflection.","But you\u2019ve got to wait two or three years for the inflection or the product won\u2019t be ready. You can\u2019t shoot behind the duck, right? The ducks got to be two years ahead of you, three years ahead of you.","And then second what we saw coming was NAND. And in fact, maybe even at your conference in 2014, I thought being NAND at the end of the County was going to be a little bigger than it ended up being, because we saw the inflections. We were betting on it even if you go back to your conference event 2014 early 2014. And we had the product that\u2019s doing pretty well.","So now what you have is, these inflections, products will take two or three years to come along. The hard part frankly was bridging this period. And now what\u2019s going to happen is the products, where the pipeline inflections are happening and we have more products in the pipeline for more inflections, if you go look at areas like inspection and things like that. So the momentum is building up. We had to get through a two or three-year period. In terms of Tokyo Electron, Gary forced everybody to stay focused on the business.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Atif Malik","Hi, thanks for taking a follow-up. I have a question for Gary. Gary, given your background in process diagnostics and control, what is Applied strategy moving forward in terms of integrating the e-beam success you\u2019re having as well as other products with etch and the process reactors we\u2019ve seen Hermes and ASML getting together Kelly LaMar [ph] still trying to get together, just wanted to get your thoughts on how much closer control and integrated metrology can you benefit from in your process and etch reactors?","Bob Halliday","Yes, let me talk a little bit about the inspection business. So this is going to be a very strong year for us. In that business, we could have a record year \u2013 our fiscal year 2016 revenue in this business and very, very strong pull from customers. As you said I have a lot of history relative to this business. And what I would say is that, e-beam what I hear from customers is that, e-beam is really at an inflection point. If you look at the changes in the devices, the device structures, there\u2019s a bigger problem with systematic types of problems, where e-beam is the best solution.","So we see tremendous pull from customers really an inflection relative to e-beam technology, especially focused on these systematic defects. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing from a market perspective Applied Materials over half of our revenue is e-beam. We have the strongest technology in the market in e-beam. We are the leader in e-beam review. We\u2019re gaining share in CD SAM.","And we\u2019ve just launched this PROVision product, and I think there\u2019s just tremendous opportunity with PROVision in the first year of launching the product. We\u2019re already getting reorders from leading foundry and memory customers. And I believe what we talked about before was achieving 20% share in e-beam inspection in the first year.","So we see tremendous growth opportunities in e-beam, in an area where Applied is the strongest relative to technology. So overall, in PDC, we have a great \u2013 we have great technology, very strong customer pull, and a great opportunity to drive growth.","Michael Sullivan","Well, thank you, Atif for your question, and we\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. We do hope to see you at the Analyst Day in New York on September 21. And in the meantime, thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect."],"3015":["Applied Materials, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Applied's third quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC.","Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike. Our results for the third fiscal quarter demonstrates strong execution in an environment that remains challenging for the time being. Overall, our view of 2019 is consistent with what we've previously communicated. Within our served markets, foundry and logic spending is strong, while investments by memory and display customers are significantly lower than last year. We also remain mindful of the broader macroeconomic risks. During this industry down cycle, my primary focus is ensuring the organization is executing on the initiatives that will put Applied Materials in the best position for the future. I believe the opportunities for Applied are compelling as powerful new demand drivers emerge in the form of IoT, big data and artificial intelligence.","So even though we are prudently managing discretionary spending in the near term, we are fully funding R&D to accelerate customers' roadmaps and building new products and capabilities that will underpin the company's growth in the years ahead. In today's call, I'll begin with a brief update on the near-term market dynamics, I'll then talk about emerging technology trends and Applied's strategy to address them, then I'll finish by highlighting some of our recent accomplishments.","Starting with the current environment. Our views of the semiconductor and display markets are largely unchanged. In memory, spending has softened slightly since our May call. On the supply side, we still see customers making disciplined investments, while adjusting factory output to reduce inventory levels. On the demand side, we believe the price elasticity of NAND is starting to take effect in the form of increases in the average bits per box for both smartphones and PCs. Based on our current visibility, we remain optimistic about 2020 with an expectation that NAND investments will recover ahead of DRAM. In foundry logic, demand has strengthened as the year has progressed as we see customers accelerating the ramps of their leading-edge nodes. Demand for specialty nodes that serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power and image sensor markets is also driving robust investments in capacity and new technology. Taking these factors into account, our view of overall wafer fab equipment spending for 2019 remains the same, down mid- to high-teens on a percentage basis relative to last year. We see 2020 as a more positive set-up for the industry and Applied with the start of a recovery in memory investment and sustained strength in foundry logic spending.","In display, there are no significant changes to the outlook we provided last quarter, and we still anticipate our 2019 revenue being down by about 1\/3 relative to 2018. Just as in semi, we're excited about the inflections taking place in display and the opportunities these create. We're getting ready for the future by ensuring we have the right portfolio of products to help our customers accelerate the introduction of next-generation technologies, including rigid and flexible OLED and larger substrates for manufacturing. A few weeks ago, Applied hosted our second AI Design Forum with more than 700 attendees, representing leading companies from across the ecosystem. My main take away from this conference is strong alignment around 4 key themes. First, AI and big data are driving new approaches to computing that require new system architectures built from new types of semiconductor devices. Second, at the time when improvements in power, performance, area and cost are paramount, classic Moore's law scaling is running out of gas.","Third, to address this, new approaches for semiconductor design and manufacturing are needed. In our view, the new industry playbook has 5 elements. New architectures, new devices in 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink feature geometries and new ways to connect chips together. Fourth, to accelerate implementation of the new playbook, company's need to connect and work together differently by breaking down traditional silos. At Applied, we're aligning our strategy and investments around this vision of the future. For example, new types of memory, including MRAM, PCRAM and ReRAM I high potential technologies that can enable new architectures and provide significant PPAC benefits at the edge and in the cloud. But these 3D devices are also incredibly challenging to make at high volume and yield. In the case of MRAM, the devices based on a film stack of more than 30 thin layers, some of which are only 8 atoms high. Missing atoms or imperfections in materials have a significant impact on the performance and endurance of the device.","To help drive adoption of these advanced memories, we recently introduced one of the most sophisticated products we've ever created, combining many of our leadership technologies in one integrated system. This new system has 9 different wafer processing locations and each process chamber can deposit up to 5 different materials. The entire process flow takes place under ultra-high vacuum to keep impurities out, and we use cryogenics and heat to vary process temperatures by hundreds of degrees. All of this is critical to optimize material, structures and interfaces. The system also includes unique onboard metrology that allows us to measure key properties of the materials to 100 of a nanometer as they are being created and modified. This next generation of equipment that we call Integrated Materials Solutions is one of the ways Applied is bringing to bear our broad technologies and capabilities to address our customers' most complex challenges.","Another area where Applied has unique technology and breadth is advanced packaging. Applied has the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions to support customer's advanced packaging roadmaps and new heterogeneous integration approaches. In the past quarter, we won an important process tool of record positions at leading customers, securing over 80% of the applications we competed for, including CVD, PVD, CMP, and etch where we have highly differentiated new products. Our inflection-focused innovation strategy is also yielding results with our unit process tools that enabled new 3D structures, the introduction of new materials and new ways to shrink. For example, we've been building on our strength in conductor etch for memory by winning new steps in both DRAM and NAND, as well as new positions for critical etch applications in foundry logic.","We're also finding new ways to deliver more value to customers through our service business. One example of this is using advanced metrology sensors, data science and simulation to speed up the transfer of new technologies from Applied's labs to customers' factories, and then reduce the time it takes to optimize yield, output and cost.","While growth in Applied Global Services is slightly below our prior expectations, we still anticipate our combined spares and service revenues being up this year, even as customers pull back on their capital spending and operating expenses.","Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Our view of 2019 is relatively unchanged. Thanks to the hard work of our employees across the company, we are delivering solid performance even with the current weakness in memory and display demand. During this industry down cycle, we are focused on driving R&D programs and building new capabilities that will move the needle for customers and Applied in the AI era. And we remain excited about our long-term opportunities as these powerful secular demand drivers start to take shape.","Now Dan will provide his perspective on our results and outlook.","Daniel Durn","Thanks, Gary. In Q3, Applied delivered solid financial results with revenue, margins and earnings above the midpoint of our guidance. Our semi-related business continues to feel stable. And while I'm still not ready to call the bottom of the cycle, I see positive leading indicators of future growth. In memory, our customers reported significant output reductions during the quarter. They discussed inventory reductions in their end markets and demand elasticity across smartphones, PCs and servers.","In foundry logic, demand is strong, both in the leading nodes and in trailing geometries driven by IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensor applications. We believe our markets will become significantly larger as powerful new demand drivers kick in, and we're positioning Applied to generate strong shareholder value by focusing on our 4 financial priorities. One, we are tightly managing our overall spending. While two, fully funding and expanding our product road map and customer technology engagements to fuel growth. Three, increasing the recurring revenue we earned by helping our customers maximize their returns from the installed base. And 4, delivering attractive cash returns to shareholders. For example, this quarter we held overall spending flat but increased the R&D portion of non-GAAP OpEx to 69%. This outcome demonstrates how we are controlling our discretionary spending, while fueling innovation and future growth.","We announced plans to acquire Kokusai Electric to expand our presence in the batch technology and accelerate innovation for our customers. This will also strengthen our services and customer support capabilities in the memory markets and throughout Asia. And we delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders, including while the Kokusai transaction is being reviewed.","During the quarter, we paid $0.21 per share in dividends, including the 5% increase our Board approved in March, and we used $528 million to repurchase over 12 million shares at an average price of around $42 per share.","Over the past year, we've repurchased 68 million shares at an average price below $39, and we have $2.4 billion remaining on our buyback authorization. In short, we're excited about our opportunities, and we're focused on taking actions that will generate significant shareholder value in the years ahead.","Now I'll summarize our Q3 results. We delivered company revenue of $3.56 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin of 44%, both above the midpoint of our outlook. We held non-GAAP OpEx to $746 million, and generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.74, which was near the top end of our guidance range.","Turning to the segments. Semiconductor Systems revenue was $2.27 billion, which was above the midpoint of our outlook, and non-GAAP operating margin increased to 27.5%. Global services revenue was $931 million, which was below the midpoint of our outlook, and non-GAAP operating margin declined to 27.8%. I'll take a moment to explain what we're seeing in AGS.","Last quarter, I explained that we have 2 kinds of service business, long-term agreements that give us subscription-like revenue and transactional parts and services. In Q3 and in our outlook for Q4, long-term service agreement revenue is growing right in line with our forecasts. But our transactional business is being impacted by the output reductions in memory. We still expect a record year for AGS, but we're lowering our growth target to low single-digits. Revenue from our overall semi-installed base business, which includes parts and services, along with upgrades and refurbs, will grow even faster and set a new record. Moving to display, Q3 revenue and operating margin both declined slightly as we expected.","Next, I'll provide our Q4 guidance. We expect company revenue to be approximately $3.685 billion, plus or minus $150 million, and we expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.80 per share. Within this outlook, we expect Semiconductor Systems revenue to be approximately $2.25 billion. Services revenue should be about $955 million. And display revenue should be around $455 million, which would be up 34% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 43.5%, and non-GAAP OpEx should be about $755 million. Looking ahead to 2020, we continue to expect growth across our markets and a gradual U-shaped recovery. While we only guide one quarter at a time, I'll offer you some planning assumptions for the early part of fiscal 2020 to help with your models.","On a quarterly basis, we view $2.2 billion as a good baseline for Semiconductor Systems revenue until we see evidence of a recovery. We expect AGS revenue to be flat with our Q4 guidance, which is a bit better than seasonal, and we expect display to be about flat with our Q4 guidance, which demonstrates our expectation that we've passed to the bottom of the display cycle. Gross margin should remain approximately flat versus Q4 on the mix we foresee, and OpEx should increase to around $800 million as we layer in the annual merit increases, along with R&D for new products and the new technology initiatives Gary described. In short, we see structural growth in the years ahead, positive leading indicators for 2020 and the opportunity to drive strong shareholder value by investing in breakthrough innovations that Applied Materials is uniquely positioned to deliver.","Now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Dan. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore.","Christopher Muse","I guess, first question, in your prepared remarks, you talked about expectations for NAND to recover sooner than DRAM. And so, I guess, on that front, how are you thinking about that coming back in terms of both timing and magnitude? As well as, as we move from single stack to multi-stack and there's clearly clean room availability, how are you thinking about conversions versus new capacity as that comes online into 2020 and beyond?","Daniel Durn","CJ, maybe I'll start and see if Gary wants to offer anything from a technology standpoint towards the end. So when we think about the memory market, and you called out NAND specifically. But let me broaden the comments just a little bit more to encompass the entire memory market, we don't expect to see a recovery in 2019, we see it as a 2020 event. And as you pointed out, we expect to see NAND first then followed by DRAM. If we think about where we sit today from an overall WFE standpoint, the memory markets are clearly down in 2019 versus where we were in 2020, so this is clearly a correction year. But we are seeing early signs of improvement. Output across the industry has come down, we are under shipping true end market demand from a supply standpoint as we exit the year. This is bringing our customers inventories down, it's bringing our customers' customers inventories down, and we do see the early signs of demand elasticity beginning to kick in and signs of price stability. When we met all of this together, we definitely see 2020 as a recovery year in the memory market. And again, we see it as a NAND-led event followed by DRAM.","In terms of magnitude, I think it's premature to be point specific on any individual market right now into 2020, but we like the setup of what we see. When we take a step back and we think about the long-term in these markets beyond 2020, we do see that there is a data explosion as the data economy kicks in and the value of that data is increasingly going up as companies learn how to monetize it. We see capital intensity going up. We see new forms of memories, which really plays to our strengths in materials. We see our customer base being rational and disciplined. We met all that together, we think there's a real opportunity to go structurally larger as a memory market off of the levels we're currently seeing in the current environment. So we feel good about the long run.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Maybe I can add something relative to our position in memory and also in NAND. I think many of you know that we have a much more balanced overall share across memory and foundry logic. In memory, we increased our share of total spending from less than 15% in 2013 to around 20% today, and we're confident we're going to continue to drive gains into the future. Another thing that's really positive for Applied is memory is very much driven by materials-enabled scaling. And I think everyone's aware, capital intensity has been increasing. We are also engaged with all the major memory companies with Integrated Materials Solutions. Again, it's all about new structures, new materials, how far, especially in NAND, you can scale vertically. So we have very strong pull from customers for new materials, new products, to enable their cost and performance road maps.","In NAND, specifically, we're winning new etch applications in NAND. And to get more layers in NAND, one of the most important things is new materials, especially high selectivity hardmasks where we have very strong capability. I talked last quarter about hardmasks that increased etch selectivity by 50%, and we are seeing strong adoption of those new capabilities across multiple customers with new steps that give us significant TAM growth. So again, we've been increasing our share in NAND, we have new materials and new products that make us very optimistic. We're going to continue to drive strong momentum into the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Congrats on the solid exclusion. Gary, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China from a technology progression perspective, both on the DRAM side as well as the NAND side. It continues to be a pretty big part of your business as well as your peers' businesses in the near term as well. So if you can talk about the rate of progress on the technology front as well as your expectations in terms of WFE for 2019 and preliminary thoughts on 2020? That will be helpful, and I've got a follow-up.","Gary Dickerson","So our view on China is similar to what we communicated before. We don't see any major inflection in spending. 2019, we see relatively flat versus 2018. If you look at domestic China, our view is a little stronger over the past few months with some increases in memory. For the year as a whole, we see slightly higher spending on foundry logic versus memory. With foundry logic focused on IoT, communications, sensors, those types of devices. In our -- in display business in China, we believe that's going to be down roughly in line with our global display forecast. Overall, in China, we have a great position, semi-service, we've been in China for 35 years, the display is a great team for us, very, very strong customer relationships and engagements. Relative to the technology progression, I don't really think, again, anything has changed from what we communicated before. As I said, we believe the foundry logic on the trailing nodes is where we will see over half of the domestic investment this year. We think that market is going to continue to grow. If you look at image sensors, that's going to be a very strong market, and we see the investment there, it's being rational and in line with the increase in demand for those types of products.","Memory is a -- those are very difficult technologies, and it's a long road to be able to produce those technologies at a competitive level for performance and cost. As we've communicated before, we don't see any big hockey sticks. I really don't see much different than what we saw before. We think it's going to be a long journey and incremental spending going forward.","Toshiya Hari","Great. And as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about market share. If we take your October quarter guide for the Semiconductor Systems business and the guide from Dan into the January quarter, I guess, we get a calendar '19 segment revenue number that's slightly better than what you described for overall WFE. Is the slight market share gain implied in your guidance a function of your SAM acting a little bit better than prior years? Or are you actually picking up share within the markets that you serve?","Gary Dickerson","Toshiya, so there's no question, 2019 is a more favorable setup for Applied. And I have really very strong confidence that we're in a great position to keep the momentum going into the future. If you look at the third-party data for overall spending, you'll see that we've been on the trend of higher or flat share, all the way back to 2012, except last year where the mix was very heavy in places like batch processing, dielectric etch, litho where we don't participate. So absolutely the mix is more favorable for us this year, so we are not going to make any specific predictions, but the set up for sure is much better for us this year. We're winning many head to heads and especially in applications. We have a very strong pipeline of new products, including products that expand our positions into the markets that we don't currently serve. ","Some of those products are already gaining traction with major customers. I spent a lot of my time with the customer and R&D leaders, that's what I love to do more than anything else. And in discussions with them, it's clear that they're struggling to deliver improvements in power, performance and cost. I think it's also clear, and this was evident at the AI Design Forum last month that the future's not going to look like in the past, the classic 2D scaling isn't working. And all my interactions with R&D leaders, they talk about new materials, 3D structures, new ways to connect chips together, new ways to drive costs. And I really deeply believe, Applied is in the best position we've ever been in to enable this new playbook with the breadth of products we have to create, shape, modify and analyze new structures. Our combined capability is unique, enables us to deliver Integrated Materials Solutions, we talked last year about 1,000x improvement in leakage current, we talked this year about this amazing MRAM capability, and those are new ways to drive performance and power performance area and cost. And also, we're currently engaged with all major customers in memory and foundry logic with these new integrated material solutions. So that combination of new IMS solutions, our capability to enable the new playbook, new products, put us in a great position to accelerate roadmaps for customers and drive future growth for Applied. So again, I'd like the setup for 2019 and also into the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik","Good job on the execution. Gary, a couple of memory makers have talked about CapEx being down for next year. You sound optimistic on NAND and your peers have said the same. How do you reconcile these 2 and what is your view based on the recovery in memory pricing or share availability?","Daniel Durn","Atif, this is Dan. I think I'll jump in and take this. So all we can bake into our forecast and the expectations we set into the market are the things we see, the conversations we have with our customers about expectations out into the future as well as the bottom modeling we do from an industry and end-market device standpoint and the consumption of bits in those boxes as well as top-down economic modeling and forecasting. And as you can imagine, our forecast comes together. It's a triangulation of those events, but we spent a lot of time talking to customers and based on all of the information that we have to date, our best view out into the future is for 2020 to be a recovery year in the memory market and for WFE to be up year-over-year. That said, in this environment, we are setting an expectation, and we think it's prudent to do this, setting an expectation for gradual U-shaped recovery. If the industry does better than we're currently contemplating, then we, as a company, will benefit in a very material way, and we like that setup. But when we net it all out, to us, it's a matter of when, not if. And in our view, it's a 2020 event for memory.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Congratulations on solid results given all the uncertainty in the macro. Gary, wondering if you could spend a little bit more time talking about the market opportunity for sort of the N minus 1 at the foundries being driven by industrial, auto, IoT. How big do you think that is? And I guess, importantly, with trailing edge nodes staying stronger, longer, what does that do for reuse of the foundries at leading-edge? Is that actually driving a bigger end spend because reuse is slowing down?","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Yes, I think, for sure, we see that this, especially market growth, is going to continue to increase for the future. If you think about -- people talk about a trillion connect to devices and generating significant amounts of data, that's right, smacked at the middle of that type of market. And this is a really great growth opportunity for Applied. We have a great portfolio of products across 200- and 300-millimeter technology. If you look at foundry logic, again, maybe some people don't understand the dynamics, about 50% is growing in areas like IoT, communications, auto, power devices and sensors and innovation there is really driven by materials innovations. So again those are areas where Applied has a significant strength. We've increased focus on these markets, and we have a great team of leaders across the company to work with customers to enable their road maps. I mean, I personally have visited a lot of these key customers over the last 2 or 3 months, tremendous pull for the technologies that we're developing. I'll give you one example of a situation that happened this last quarter. ","We won 2\/3 of the revenue opportunities at a major customer in this specialty market where the selections are very sticky over many, many years. Once you're qualified, you're in for a long period of time. So again, that was a case where in terms of the spending, we were winning a huge percentage of those opportunities, and this is, again, all about materials, innovations and structures, and we have a lot of technologies currently that are unique for these particular markets, and we have an increased focus there in developing new technologies. Our culture is really focused on being the preferred strategic partner for all of our different customers, enabling their technology roadmaps, enabling their future for those different markets. Going forward, this is a great opportunity for us to partner with these customers, the breadth of technologies combined with Integrated Materials Solutions, I think really puts us in a really good position.","Daniel Durn","And, John, just a follow-up and add a little bit to what Gary said which talks about reuse and the implication that has for spend on the leading-edge, I do think we're seeing a different pattern evolving the industry. When I walked in the front door a couple of years ago, I think we had a point of view on what the total capacity footprint in 28 nanometers was for the industry, and that has gone up significantly in the last couple of years. We're looking at mature nodes. And the way the industry used to work, as you know, you'd introduce a new node, you'd have a big investment cycle to put the capacity statement in place, and then you'd see the investment level falloff on that node. And then our customers would opportunistically look to reuse equipment as they build out the next node. I think what we're seeing is investment profiles, many years after the introduction of the node, being much larger than we've seen historically and I do think that, that's going to impact the rate of reuse as these more mature nodes continue to grow in size relative to our original expectations. So we really like the way the industry is broadening and diversifying, and the implications that has long term on the attractiveness of this market for us.","John Pitzer","Just quickly, as my follow-up, I know you guys only guide one quarter out, but you give us some sort of sign, color for entering fiscal '20, which would suggest that revenue and gross margin kind of flattish at these levels, but OpEx is going up. I'm just kind of curious, are you clearly signaling to us that margin start off a little bit weaker in the fiscal year 2020? Or are these more rounding errors? But if it's the former, when do you start to reestablish kind of operating leverage in the model?","Daniel Durn","John, so just a little perspective on how we view OpEx and operating margin and maybe the commentary gets at the point that you're asking. So this is a company we're very focused on increasing operating margin percentage over time. I think what you saw in the most recent quarter is a very disciplined approach to the OpEx. We're compressing discretionary spend, and we're channeling more of our OpEx towards the R&D engine, things that are going to fuel growth at the company over time. And so 69% is a record high for the company, and we feel good about that discipline. What you see profiling into Q1 is the annual merit increase that we get every year, but it's also a statement around the opportunities we see. Moore's Law is hitting a wall, Gary has talked about a new playbook that is going to increasingly define the power performance road map of this industry that creates an enormous set of opportunities for us. ","We are going to invest in R&D, we are going to drive growth and drive leadership into this industry over the next decade as it fundamentally inflects and drives the power performance road map in a very different way than we've seen historically. The way -- from where we sit today, we expect our semi business to be up year-over-year. We expect our services business to be up off of these levels year-over-year, and we expect our display business to also grow into next year. And as the industry recovers, and we take our company structurally larger, I think you're going to see the operating margins expand as we grow the company and the investments that we're making today to drive that future leadership should allow us to outperform as that industry recovers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Nice job on the quarterly execution. On the strong sequential growth outlook in display in Q4 and the sustain levels into early next fiscal year, can you guys just help us understand the mixed large-screen versus mobile OLED? And how do you see that mix as we look at into next fiscal year?","Gary Dickerson","Sure. Absolutely. Yes. So let me give color on the display business and this gets at your question. As we said in the prepared remarks, we still see this play down about 1\/3 versus 2019. We don't guide display fab equipment, but this is basically what customers are telling us about next year. We see 2020 for Applied being higher than 2019. We also expect TV investment to be roughly flat next year, many of these are Gen 10.5, there are long lead times, and so we have pretty good visibility into that part of the market. And we do expect mobile OLED to increase as a percentage of the overall market next year. So we do see the overall display business being up next year. Longer term, we believe the markets still going to be cyclical, but we've continue to be optimistic about the market based on trends, including TV size and build-out of Gen 10.5 that's going to take many years, the mobile OLED conversion and eventually innovations like RGB OLED TV, foldable smartphone, all of those different areas.","For Applied, the adoption of OLED, I think many of you know, is also more capital-intensive. So as those technologies are adopted in more types of devices, that's good for us from a capital intensity standpoint. We're also investing to drive new products to expand into very large TAM growth areas. We're not to give any more color today about those specific products. But again, the pull from customers is still very strong, and we're making progress in those areas. Together, take all this together, we see good opportunities to drive growth in our display business into 2020 and beyond.","Harlan Sur","Great. And then maybe as a follow-up to one of the prior questions. On your new MRAM and storage class memory PVD platforms, just given the increase in content and microcontrollers, in IoT industrial and automotive applications and a growing need for higher embedded memory density for MCU. Seems like there's just as much opportunity on legacy semi MCU processes as there is for high-performance storage class memory architectures, has the team tried to size of the SAM opportunity here for your two new platforms, sort of looking out over the next 2 to 3 years?","Gary Dickerson","Yes, thanks for the question. So we think this market is going to start small. It's around $100 million for us so far. But as you mentioned, it's very strategic in future customer applications. We see this type of device moving from lower flash replacement to bigger applications like L3 cash replacements, especially DRAM replacement. Again it's not something that's going to ramp overnight, but we do see incremental growth in the market. And then I think for us, when I was at Semicon and AIDF, this was one of the things for me, personally, I was most excited to talk about. Because when you think about these new devices, I think many of you know, it takes many, many, many years to go from a single structure that you publish a paper with certain kinds of performance to making billions of those devices at the right cost, high yield, speed, power, endurance, all of those things. And so talking about the system that we had at Semicon, you have all this amazing technology into 1 Integrated Materials Solution and ultra-high vacuum. You have a structure like an atomic layer 3D printer almost, where you're -- you have a structure with more than 30 layers, some only 8 atoms high, 10 different materials, temperatures on the wafer that range about 500 degrees C and ability to measure the key properties of the materials as they are being created to 100th of a nanometer.","And all of this, all of this is really critical to optimize the material structures and interfaces. So again, certainly, the better you can drive the performance, yield, reliability, the more applications you can win and the faster the market ramps. And so what we're excited about, and certainly, the companies that we're working with, they're very excited about, is being able to scale a technology like this into high-volume, high yield and right cost and right performance. So again, we see this market small today but certainly, relative to future compute architectures, it is very, very, very important.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","I had a question on service, I don't know if, Gary, you want to take it or, Dan, you want to take it. But if I look at July, service was like $60 million light in July. And then October, you have been saying kind of like high single digit for the year. So that would imply that the October number is like coming in at about $150 million light of what you thought it would be. So that's like a $200-million number over a 6-month period. And so that's like 10% of the entire AGS segment revenue. But I think you had also said previously that the spares and service part of AGS is like half of the revenue. So really, it's like 20% of the spares and service portion. So I get the memory production cuts, but that's a huge number for a business, but I think people consider to be quite stable. And I think your peers are sort of seeing a little bit better trend there. So I'm wondering if you can talk about that.","Daniel Durn","Tim, let me share with you a little bit of my views about the business and hopefully, it gives some color and perspective. If we take a look at our services business, this is a business that the team has really tuned strategy, we've got a great strategy. Strong execution over the last, call it, 4 years, it's a business we've grown at a compound rate of about 15%. Last year, we grew it at over 20%. This year, expectation coming into the year was high-single digits. As we look at underlying components of the business, there's an element of the business that's long-term service agreements that's more subscription-like, and its revenue. As we look at performance of that business in Q3 and Q4, it's profiling exactly like we thought. And so a mid-teens grower into Q3 and Q4.","When we look at the other part of the business, the other half of the business being more transactional, spares and service related, that has a connection to industry utilization and factory outputs. Clearly, we saw a falloff in Q3 and Q4 as the memory industry has structurally brought down its factory output to work through the induced -- inventory correction. We initially thought this was going to be of flattish business for the year, it now looks like it's down low double digits for the year. The combination of the mid-teens grower and down low double digits gets you a low single digit grower as an overall business if we were to classify our business similar to others in the industry. In addition to growing low single-digits, added our 300-millimeter refurbs and upgrades to the business. This is an all-time record year for us, and it's something that's growing quite a bit stronger than the segment reported services business. So I wouldn't necessarily look at our absolute performance or relative performance and think that there's something deficient in the way the business is profiling. We think we've got a great business, the team is executing well and as industry utilization recovers into next year, should provide a nice leg of growth to the business going forward.","Gary Dickerson","Maybe just let me add a little bit color on the service business. As Dan talked about, certainly, there's been a reduction in wafer starts and you also mentioned this in the question with memory customers, so that's impacting the spares parts business. But one thing that's been a major change in our strategy, starting in 2013, was to drive more subscription-type revenue with customers, and that's been very successful. If you go back to '13, we had net 0 adds in terms of -- and service contracts. Since then, that part of the business has been growing very, very fast, Dan talked about even in this year with WFE down a fair amount, that part of our business is still growing at a very high rate and that subscription revenue from longer-term agreements is now larger than our transactional spares and service business. And that's really because we continue to see strong pull from customers, accelerating R&D, accelerating fab rams, optimizing yield output and cost in high-volume manufacturing. We also have a very strong strategy in data analytics. We have over thousands of tools connected in customers' fabs, that's creating value for customers today and that creates a great opportunity for us to continue to drive that data-enabled strategy to create value for customers and also to drive growth for Applied.","Just one more data point, if you look at our spares and service business, and again, this is separating out upgrades, refurbishments and other things that are counted by some people, if you look at just our subscription revenue and our spare parts business, transactional business, that business has grown 27% over the last 2 years with wafer fab equipment being flat. So that shows that even in a case where wafer fab equipment is not growing, that service business is growing. So we're very optimistic that we're going to drive this business at a high rate going forward, at Applied, and also create more value for our customers.","Timothy Arcuri","Awesome, Gary. Just as follow up, there was a major memory maker in China running around Flash Memory Summit. They were talking about spending $10 billion on WFE between 2019 and '20. Very, very big numbers that I don't think anybody's modeling. Can you talk just more generally, about China memory efforts and whether next year could be a pretty big year from the indigenous China guys?","Gary Dickerson","We're not really giving any color on 2020 right now. I think what I had said earlier on the call relative to '19 is that we see '19 relatively flat with '18. And I honestly, don't see a big hockey stick. I've said this to pass over the last few years also, haven't seen a big hockey stick, I think that the spending certainly in foundry logic is rational around IoT sensors, communications all of those kinds of devices. That's a little over half of the domestic spending this year and certainly, we believe that there will be some incremental spending but we're not going to give any color on the call today relative to forecasting 2020 for China.","Operator","Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company.","Krish Sankar","I have two of them, Dan, given that the semi business is stabilizing at the revenue levels, but the mix is shifting more towards foundry logic versus memory, I would have thought your gross margin performance has been better? Can you give us how to eliminate some of that and what's going on the gross margin side? And then as a follow-up, I'll ask it right away. You guys gave some color on FY '20 display revenues relative to 2019. Given that the deal was 9 months late on visibility, how should we think of FY '20 just relative to FY '18 where you did about $2.5 billion?","Daniel Durn","Thanks, Krish. Let's take them into order. First, on the gross margin and the foundry logic showing signs of strength. Let me start by saying this is a company that's laser-focused on driving those margins up over time. And if we we're talking about the business mix from may be a few years ago, I think maybe we'd be seeing incrementally higher gross margins. But let me help you a little bit with some of the mix factors that we see going into gross margin given who we are today. So as we take a look at our services in display business and growing it as a part of our portfolio, we know that those two businesses, and we've done a great job growing them, those two businesses have a gross margin that's lower than the corporate average, but we expect each of those businesses, and we expect each of those businesses to be up as we look into 2020.","And then within our semi portfolio, our leadership businesses are doing really, really well, but the profile of our semi business is changing as we grow. And there's a couple of things I would point to. First, our etch footprint. These are gross margins, products with gross margins that are not as high as may be other parts of the portfolio, but we're doing a great job driving that business, we're expanding that business into new opportunities and beyond memory in the foundry logic. And that certainly changes the profile of our business as we grow forward. Second thing I'd point to, and we talked about it on this call, is foundry logic spend diversifying. There was a time a decade ago when it was 90% on the leading-edge, and then it evolved to 80-20, 60-40%. And now for, the last 3 years, '17, '18 in '19, it's fully split 50-50 between leading-edge technologies and trailing node geometries. ","And where we compete in the trailing node geometries with differentiated equipment and our key enablers of some of the technologies and products that are being brought to market, that's super attractive business for us. But there's also opportunities in that market where we compete with 300-millimeter refurbs, 200-millimeter systems. And while those products offer really attractive operating margins and cash flow, the gross margins might be a little bit lower than we see in some of the other businesses we pursue. So we're going to continue to stay focused, we're going to continue to drive gross margin over time, particularly as we see the industry recover, we drive revenue higher from this point going forward, we do think we're going to be able to grow the semi business into next year, grow the AGS business into next year and the display business. So we're going to stay focused on execution, and we feel good about how the business is profiling. Yes, and then the second part of your question was on display. Could you repeat the question? I apologize, I lost...","Gary Dickerson","Yes. I can do it. Basically, on display relative to 2020, what we said earlier as we think 2020 is going to be a little higher than 2019. I don't think we're going to give anything more specific at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","I think, when you started the call, you mentioned that you're still not comfortable calling the bottom. And I'm curious, what in the environment is preventing you from doing that? Is it order visibility? Is at the macro environment? And what do you see -- what do you think your memory customers will start to add incremental capacity?","Daniel Durn","Vivek. I think, I'll come back to the comments we made a little earlier that in an environment defined by what we see today, we do think it's an elevated risk profile around some macro environment -- around the macro environment as well as geopolitical, I just think it's prudent in an environment that's characterized like the one we're in to set expectations in a modest way. We have conversations with customers, if I would give a direct read through on those conversations, I think you would see expectations set at the different level. But again, and come back to environment like this, I just don't think that's a prudent place to be. So we want to set expectations in a more modest way. We're setting expectations for gradual and U-shaped off these levels. Certainly, if the industry recovers faster than where we're setting the expectations given our broad portfolio and how we're positioned in all of the markets, this is a company that's going to benefit in a very material way if that happens. So we feel good about the position, we feel good about finding stability in the business and we do think it's just a matter of when, not if, and we'll be ready to take advantage of those opportunities when they materialize.","Vivek Arya","Okay. And as a quick follow-up. On the market share side, I know last year, you guys were down 2 point -- but you're starting to recover that in recent quarters, heading into 2020, which areas do you think AMAT is best positioned to gain share? And what will be the impact of EUV in that share progression and how is that impacted?","Gary Dickerson","So if you look at EUV, we still see Applied growing in patterning and we also see a growth in overall WFE, even as EUV find areas of adoption. As we've communicated before, last year, EUV was a headwind. As we look forward, you have to look at different segments. EUV has a very small impact on memory. When memory recovers, that's going to be very positive for Applied relative to the TAM opportunity. Memory is really about materials enabled scaling, and we have gained share in memory, very deep engagements with our customers and good opportunities to continue to drive share gains. In NAND, we have a great opportunity to enable 3D scaling, I talked about new hardmasks. Our etch position continues to grow. And DRAM, they're adding metal gate in the periphery, and this is where we have high share as those processes are adopted. I talked earlier about IoT communications, sensors, that's an area where I talked about. We won 2\/3 of the TAM opportunity here recently with a customer, and that's about 50% of the foundry logic spending. ","So we have momentum in all of these different areas. And then other thing I would say is that we've talked about this new playbook. New architectures, new materials, new structures, new ways to connect things together and new ways to shrink. We really have new technologies and new products in many of those different areas. And so I've given color today on the call about many of those different opportunities, and that's also why we're investing more going forward. We have a very strong point of view. The market driven by AI, big data is going to be strong in the future. We believe that the new playbook, with new structures, new materials, new ways to connect to devices, all of those areas are areas where Applied has unique technologies, unique capabilities, we have products that, some of which are already seeing adoption with customers where we have traction, we're going to invest in those areas. And my main focus as CEO is to make sure we're in the right position when those markets grow in the future.","Michael Sullivan","And we're getting close to the end of our scheduled time. So Dan, would you like to help us close the call?","Daniel Durn","Thanks, Mike, Sure. Let me just share a couple of quick comments to end the call. First, I'm encouraged. I'm encouraged by the stability we're seeing in our business. I'm encouraged by the positive leading indicators that we're seeing in memory. But I'm still not ready to call the bottom, especially given the macro risks that we need to keep an eye on. At the same time, we've been in this industry a very long time, and long enough to know that something new and big is happening in computing, and it's happening just as Moore's Law is slowing down. So we see growth coming, and we believe Applied is in a special position to help this industry. So we're going to invest, we're going to create value and grow this company and outperform the market. And finally, we're going to stay close to investors, Gary and I, we're going to be hosting some meetings here in Santa Clara throughout the quarter, and I personally look forward to seeing many of you in the beginning of September in New York at the city conference.","So Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.","Michael Sullivan","Great. Thanks, Dan. And we like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available on our website by 5:00 Pacific time, and we would like to thank you for continued interest in Applied Materials.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","","Michael Sullivan","Thank you, Dustin. Today, we will discuss the results for our third quarter ending July 28. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Mike Splinter, Gary Dickerson, and Bob Halliday.","But first, let me remind you that today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements including the company\u2019s current view of its industry outlooks, growth opportunities, product, share and profitability targets and Q4 business outlook. These statements are known to contain unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied and they should be interpreted in that light.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today\u2019s earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings presentation, both of which are available on the Investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter.","","Mike Splinter","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. Before we get to our earnings discussion, I want to make a few comments about the CEO succession plan that we released today. I am very pleased to announce that we have appointed Gary Dickerson, President, CEO, and a Member of the Board of Directors effective September 1. I will be serving as Executive Chairman. And together with the rest of the Board, we will be supporting Gary as he leads our company to execute on our strategy. As President, Gary has proved to be an outstanding leader and partner focusing on Applied on new strategies for profitable growth. Having worked side-by-side with him for more than a year now, I have every confidence that his vision and personal drive will translate into remarkable success in leading Applied Materials as our next CEO.","A top responsibility for any Board is to ensure that there is a strong succession plan in place and that the company can affect a smooth leadership transition at the right time. I think we have done a very good job of this at Applied. By making this transition now, Gary will be in position to prepare this year\u2019s annual operating plan, so we can keep up our momentum for profitable growth.","As this is my last earnings call as CEO, I\u2019d like to say thank you to all of our investors and analysts for their support of applied materials over the years. So Gary would like to make a comment?","","Gary Dickerson","Thanks Mike. I\u2019m honored and excited to be given the opportunity to lead this great company into the future. On behalf of the execute team employed I would like to thank mike for his decade of service as CEO. Today thanks to Mike\u2019s leadership Applied enjoys a strong foundation than ever before on which to build momentum for profitable growth. I really believe that our opportunities have never been greater and I\u2019m excited to have the chance to lead applied materials into a new era of growth and success.","","Mike Splinter","Thanks Gary and congratulations. Let\u2019s begin our earnings discussion. We\u2019re pleased to report solid financial results for our third fiscal quarter; we delivered earnings at the mid-point of our range with global appetite for mobile devices and larger TVs driving healthy demand for our semi-conductor and display equipment. As we outlined at our recent analyst event across the company we\u2019re building momentum for profitable growth, industry trends and semi-conductor and display flavor applied materials leadership areas and at that same time we\u2019re seeing results from changes to the organization and our spending profile designed to strengthen customer collaborations and speed up product development.","We\u2019re increasing investment in 300 millimeter R&D and field technical resources to support our strategic priority of growing shares and wafer fab equipment by winning at market inflections. We\u2019re stepping up our R&D spending to ensure we have the strong product pipeline we need to drive growth, we\u2019re equally focused on reducing operating expenses and organizational complexity to improve profitability. We will provide an update on our progress later on today\u2019s call. As the mobility build-out gathers pace device makers are engaged in a battle for leadership, consumers are making buying decisions based on battery life, features, form factor and visual experience which means that our customers\u2019 ability to deliver winning products requires new device technology at the right yield and cost. Performance improvements in mobile chips and displays are becoming increasingly dependent on materials innovation. Applied is uniquely positioned to enable next generation transistors and interconnects 3D memory and high resolution, low powered displays.","In addition to robust demand for mobile devices we\u2019re seeing strength in the TV market and as a result our display business booked it's highest orders in over two years. TV unit sales are growing and average TV sizes are increasing significantly faster than historical trends. We anticipate that an average increase of two inches in 2013 versus a typical annual increase of about a 0.5 an inch. To put this in perspective for every inch of growth one new Gen 8.5 factory is needed to fulfill the incremental area of demand.","Now let me turn to our outlook, through the third year in a row seasonal buying patterns are evident as consumers wait for new smartphone and tablet models to be released in the fall, as a result we\u2019re seeing a near term slowdown in investment by our foundry customers as they focus on ramping new capacity installed over the past two quarters. This will deliver product for the holiday season and readying their next generation of technology. We expect investment levels to recover in the fourth calendar quarter.","Unit growths of mobile devices is also driving healthy demand for NAND flash memory and bit (ph) growth for 2013 is expected to be in the 40% to 50% range. The transition of 3D NAND technology into production is underway and we expect investment to accelerate in 2014 and 2015 as more manufacturers adopt this technology. In the DRAM market conditions are improving with average selling prices recovering to levels last seen in 2010 as a result of increasing bit (ph) demand for mobile applications combined with structural changes in the market and several years of underinvestment, customers are taking actions to increase bit supply. Today, these investments are primarily focused on technology conversions for the 3X to 2X node. We expect some new capacity will be added if these favorable market conditions continue into 2014. While mobility related demand remains strong, PC sales are still challenged and consequently, we are seeing some minor reductions in logic investment for the year.","Looking at industry investment as a whole, while there has been spending mix shifts towards memory in the second half of the year we are maintaining our 2013 wafer fab equipment forecast of $27 billion to $30 billion. We believe that wafer fab equipment investment will be higher in 2014, up 10% to 20% relative to this year. This will be driven primarily by the foundries building out there 20-nanometer node, investment in 3D NAND capacity, and some increase in DRAM spending. This is the spending mix that is favorable for Applied Materials.","In summary, the market environment in both semiconductor and display provides a firm foundation for profitable growth. At the same time, major industry trends are playing to Applied Materials strength in Precision Materials Engineering presenting us with an unprecedented number of opportunities. Most importantly, I am confident that we have the right strategy, the right talent, and the right new CEO to take Applied to new levels of performance.","Let me now hand the call over to Gary who will provide more details about our strategy and the progress we are making against our goals. Gary?","","Gary Dickerson","Thanks Mike. Today, I will focus on three areas, where we are building momentum for profitable growth. First, we are shaping a more competitive company that can execute better, faster, and at lower cost. Second, the major industry trends translate into positive momentum for our leadership business segments that are enabling the key technology inflections in the mobility war. And finally, we have positive momentum in growth businesses that can drive significant incremental contribution to our financial performance.","As Mike discussed, mobility is the major driver in electronics and all our customers want to be the first to introduce new technology that will help them win. Applied capabilities in Precision Materials Engineering are strategically important for our customers. And this has resulted in employing us into much earlier and deeper engagements. Today, our customer relationships have never been better. And this combined with our strong pipeline of new products is providing us with significant opportunities to grow market share as new transistor, interconnect, memory and display technologies are adopted.","To realize these great opportunities, we are making changes to execute better, faster and at lower cost. We have added very strong talent in management, product development, and the field. We have been implementing changes in our structure and business processes to improve the speed and quality of our execution. We have been increasing R&D for products that can drive future profitable growth. R&D spending as a percentage of combined R&D plus SG&A has increased from 55% a year ago to 62% today. In line with our strategic priorities, we have increased focus on our semiconductor business. By shifting overhead dollars, managing our product portfolio, and improving productivity, we increased our annualized funding for 300 millimeter R&D and field support by almost $170 million since the start of the fiscal year. All these actions are enabling us to create a pipeline of new highly differentiated products that have significant pull from the industry technology leaders and will drive future profitable growth in our leadership areas and in other markets, where we have a lot of room to grow our share and profit. Our customers were for mobility leadership is intensifying and materials innovation is their most significant levered to drive performance gains in transistor, interconnect, memory and display. In foundry the major battle is to introduce new transistor technology to enable enhanced performance and longer battery life for mobile devices, this really plays to the sweet spot of our leadership in EPI, implant, thermal, CVD, PVD and CMP. So selective epitaxy combined with our implant and new technologies improves transistor speed by more than 30% while our integrated PVD Metal Gate delivers a 100x improvement in device leakage and lower power consumption. As a result we expect to gain 5 to 10 points of PVD market share this year.","IN CMP we expected gross share about 3 points in 2013 and see future market growth as foundries and 3D NAND customers integrate additional steps. Looking ahead two inflections that will have a positive impact on our business in 2014 are foundries transiting to the 20 nanometer node and first generation 3D NAND, these new devices are very positive for Applied because the performance gains are enabled by our leadership and precision materials engineering. They grow our available market and we are in a strong position to gain share when these new devices ramp into volume manufacturing. As foundries move to 20 nanometer technology Applied served market opportunity grows approximately 25% relative to the 28 nanometer baselines.","When transistors are introduced at the 1x node we expect our served market to incrementally grow by an additional 5% to 10%. In memory the 3D NAND inflection also leverages our leadership and precision materials engineering. With the transition from plainer to 3D NAND the performance gains are driven by deposition and etch and as a result we expect our available market to grow by about 25% for first generation 3D NAND devices.","Another positive trend in 3D NAND is the adoption of EPI and thermal products, two areas where we have clear and sustainable differentiation. Overall we have a strong position in 3D NAND and anticipate our served market and share will grow as these factories ramp into volume production. We\u2019re also building momentum in additional segments including etch, inspection and display.","We\u2019re focusing on areas where we have strong pull from customers can help enable inflections and have sustainable differentiation. The talent and investment we have added in these areas are resulting in positive market share momentum. In etch our strategy has been to target areas of the market where we believe we have valuable and sustainable differentiation and this has started to yield results. In the quarter we secured important process tool of record positions in memory that provide a platform to drive significant gains in market share this year.","In inspection we have been investing an R&D and field technical support enabling us to increase our layer qualification at logic and foundry customers both at 28 and 20 nanometer technologies. We expect to translate these qualifications into shared gains for our Brightfield products this year.","Another area where we see positive momentum is display; displays have a huge influence on the desirability of mobile devices affecting user experience, power consumption and form factor. Advanced low temperature polysilicon and metal oxide transistors are being used to deliver high resolution LCD and organic LED displays that consume less power and have new form factors. These high-resolution mobile displays increased the opportunity for our CVD and PVD equipment in this market by more than 30%.","In TV, the introduction of 4K ultra-high definition and OLED is driving more complex and capital intensive manufacturing processes. Our differentiated large area, precision deposition equipment, provides device performance and yield advantages. We won 100% of the CVD and PVD business for the last two new TV factories. And we anticipate our overall share in display PVD will increase by about 25% this year. We see a pathway to grow display revenues to $1 billion or more with high operating leverage.","In summary, 2013 is shaping up to be a year, where we are building momentum for profitable growth for 2014 and beyond. We are making great progress building a more competitive company that executes better, faster, and at lower cost. We are bringing new talent and investments to key areas while implementing structural and process changes that improve the speed and quality of our execution. We have positive momentum from the major trends in semiconductor and display markets, that plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses and we have positive momentum in edge, inspection, and display that we anticipate will drive incremental contributions to profitable growth. We are very excited about our technology pipeline and laser focused on execution to make sure we take advantage of the great opportunities we have to drive profitable growth.","Now, let me hand the call over to Bob.","","Bob Halliday","Thanks, Gary and good afternoon everyone on the call. Before I cover our results for the quarter, I want to reinforce two very important points that Mike and Gary made. One, our leadership in Precision Materials Engineering creates a unique opportunity for us with our customers. And two, we are driving the necessary changes in the organization to capture this opportunity while improving the overall profitability of the company. To fund these changes and improve our profitability, we are significantly reducing the cost of doing business. We are rapidly eliminating organizational complexity and reducing the investment in the areas with lower returns and reallocating these dollars into our product pipeline for the highest value opportunities. We are already seeing the shift in our financials.","On a GAAP basis, G&A as a percentage of R&D plus SG&A has decreased from 24.3% a year ago to 21.4% in Q2 to 17.9% in Q3. At the same time, R&D as a percentage of R&D plus SG&A has increased from 54.8% a year ago to 58.5% in Q2 to 61.6% in Q3. The net result is a 4% year-over-year decline in the spending while increasing R&D by 8%. We will see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, but the trends reflect of the systematic reallocation of our spending that is taking place. This reallocation is driving incremental momentum with customers. One simple leading indicator of this momentum is the number of our semiconductor evaluation tools is expected to increase more than 20% in the next two quarters. In addition, a leading indicator of future spending is headcount and our total headcount is down 6% or approximately 900 employees from a year ago with most of that reduction coming out of EES and the corporate functions.","The Applied functional organizations are doing a great job of driving these rapid changes. The teams are doing extensive benchmarking, quickly adopting best known methods and working to improve the velocity of the company. I have been really pleased and grateful for everyone\u2019s efforts. The job is getting reallocated into additional R&D investments are going into semiconductor and display. These are business that have high share or they are growing share with strong product pipelines, in SSG we\u2019re extremely well leveraged to the transistor technology inflections occurring over the next few years. It is possible that the great majority of our business units will gain or hold the share. The plan is pretty straightforward, get more efficient in the cost of doing business and invest in markets and products that we know very well. The early results are very encouraging, overhead cost and solar spending are down substantially. Investment in core SSG (ph) display product is up. We\u2019re gaining share in most of those markets and the other the indicators like evaluation tools and our product pipeline are up.","These cost savings and harvested R&D investments will drive sustainable growth and profitability for Applied Materials. The money we\u2019re reinvesting is going into our highest value opportunities, markets we know and business was very good incremental margins and high and\/or growing the share.","Now I\u2019ll cover our third quarter results and comment on changes from the prior quarter. Orders were approximately $2 billion down 12% sequentially on lower semiconductor equipment demand partially offset by strength in display and AGS. We generated net sales of approximately $2 billion which was about as we expected. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.18 which was at the mid-point of our guidance.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.9% down slightly due to a less favorable product mix within SSG partially offset by less inventory charges and lower variable compensation. Over the next two quarters we expect gross margins to decline slightly as products which traditionally have had lower share and therefore less scale become a larger percentage of SSG revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $535 million below the low end of our guidance primarily due to reduced corporate spending. Our effective tax rate was 23.9% on a non-GAAP basis. We now expect the non-GAAP four year rate to be between 24% and 25%.","Cash from operations was $364 million or 18% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We returned $170 million to our stockholders in Q3; we used $50 million to repurchase 3.3 million shares and paid out $120 million in dividends reflecting the 11% quarterly dividend increase we announced in March.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of just over $3 billion. Next I will comment on our Q3 segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were down 22% to $1.2 billion due to lower but comparatively strong foundry spending. This reduction was partially offset by an increase in NAND, DRAM and logic orders. SSG net sales declined 1% to $1.3 billion with increases in NAND and logic offsetting most of the seasonal decline in foundry. SSGs non-GAAP operating margin decreased to 22.2% reflecting a less favorable product mix relative to Q2 and slightly higher operating expenses. In AGS orders were up 7% to $517 million due to improvements in customer utilization rates and wafer starts, AGS net sales were down 4% to $497 million due to a slightly less favorable wafer start by device type than expected. Non-GAAP operating margin was essentially flat at 23.3% despite slightly low revenue.","Our display orders increased 31% to $256 million with record orders in array PVD. The increase was driven by TV fab investments in China and reflects our share gains with those customers.","Display net sales increased 27% to $161 million consistent with the order ramp we experienced over the past few quarters. Display\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin increased 4.6 percentage points to 21.1% which is our highest operating margin at this level of revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2008.","EES orders were $19 million and net sales were $45 million, up $7 million from Q2. The non-GAAP operating loss declined $15 million due to lower inventory charges and our cost reduction efforts. Non-GAAP operating expenses were below $30 million in Q3 and we remain on track to lower OpEx to the low $25 million exiting the fiscal year.","Now, I will provide our fourth quarter business outlook. Overall, we expect the company\u2019s net sales to be flat relative to third quarter with a little more risk than opportunity. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $525 million plus or minus $10 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.20. Within this outlook, we expect net sales from our semiconductor business to be flat to down slightly. AGS net sales are expected to be flat to up slightly. Display net sales should be down slightly with EES net sales up slightly.","Now, let me turn over the call to Mike Sullivan for questions.","","Michael Sullivan","Thanks Bob. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Dustin, let\u2019s please begin.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Yes, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. Congratulations to both Gary and Mike. Great job to both of you guys.","","Mike Splinter","Thank you.","","Gary Dickerson","Thanks Jim.","","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","I guess, first question just relative to kind of the nearer term environment, I guess and this isn\u2019t specific to Applied, because we have had the same questions as an industry for the competitors as well. It seems like what we were hearing at SEMICON West doesn\u2019t quite match what\u2019s happening in the very near-term, was that just a function of us misinterpreting the comments of SEMICON West to be near-term or have there been some pushes since those meetings relative to what we are looking at in terms of the third and fourth quarter today?","","Mike Splinter","Maybe I can comment from the industry standpoint, I think the foundry spending profile was quite predictable and pretty much in third calendar quarter is following what happened very similarly over the last three quarters. I think there is a fair difference as we look into our Q1 or into the fourth calendar quarter, we think foundry spending will pick up as they start driving towards their 20-nanometer nodes and\/or it might be teen nodes for some suppliers and we\u2019ll have a littler broader investment by a broader number of customers. I think if there is any modest surprise, it\u2019s around a little higher memory investment in the second half of the year, Jim, but I think the foundry spending was pretty predictable.","","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","And then I guess this is follow-up how long visibility do you have into the memory piece. So, theoretically, memory spending is picking up over the next several quarters, I mean how much confidence do we have that, that\u2019s a or one or two quarter phenomenon versus the two or three or four quarter phenomenon in terms of better spending there to go along with the seasonal recovery in the foundries?","","Mike Splinter","Yes, I think the hedge is what\u2019s going to happen with the PC market exiting the year and going into 2014. If it was just the mobility market, we can see the compounded annual growth rate of bps per box, that\u2019s been pretty aggressive, but it\u2019s tempered by what\u2019s been happening in PCs. So, if I knew what was happening in PCs, I\u2019d be more confident that we\u2019d say that you could think of a four \u2013 especially in DRAM a four quarter run, but I\u2019d be quite hesitant to say that today. Flash memory, I think is a different story. There is technology investments here that need to be made. And I think we are seeing them being made both in 3D NAND as well as in plainer NAND.","","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Terrific. Thanks very much.","","Mike Splinter","Thank you.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. And Krish, your line is open.","","Michael Sullivan","Okay, Dustin. Maybe we will move to the next questioner and hope that Krish can pull us again.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Cowen & Company.","Tim Arcuri - Cowen & Company","So couple of things first of all Mike you talked about things snapping back in fiscal Q1, January quarter can you give a sense of how much you think revenue will snap back in January are we talking a few $100 million?","","Mike Splinter","Well I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to forecast our Q1 Time there is a lot of moving part so but I would say that we\u2019re quite certain foundry spending coming back to previous levels.","","Tim Arcuri - Cowen & Company","And then maybe a question for Bob, Bob if I look at SSG gross margins they are down about 300 basis points on flat revenue also at it sounds like SSG margins are going to hold back overall margins a bit even as revenue grows here into January. If you look back maybe 5, 6, 7 years ago you guys are having definitely a lot more success now gaining share in this two big markets that you\u2019re focused on an SSG but back you know years and years ago there was some effort to sort of see the market by I don\u2019t want to say giving away tools but pricing tools are very low and so is there any sort of metric that you can give us to sort of hold our hand that you\u2019re not doing the same thing time and that infact margins will come back in SSG as we get into next year. Thanks.","","Bob Halliday","Yeah there is a lot of moving parts Tim, in terms of I think the single biggest thing that has having impact in the next couple of quarters is mix, we\u2019re actually gaining share and some in one or two segments one particular we haven't gained share a long time, I think we will gain share but without the scale our margins are lower. I think in the strong businesses the margins are holding up pretty well, so I think it's mostly a mix, we got a little bit of issues too out there with mix of customer type and I can\u2019t point any explicit impact we can probably in the background in terms of how aggressively customers negotiated. So overall I would say we\u2019re probably going to still in the ballpark but a bunch of mix issues right now we\u2019re sorting through.","","Mike Splinter","On the areas where we\u2019re growing share and it's actually one of our highest margin businesses, as I talked about earlier we definitely have momentum there very strong pull from customers in all markets for current and future technology. Again one of the major cases I have ever seen in my career of customer pull for products. We have a lot of momentum and foundry and logic, we\u2019re increasing layer penetration at 28 nanometer, 20 nanometer and also since that with the technology leader on that particular device.","We have really strong pull from customers on the unique imaging and defect capture capabilities, especially for patterning applications. We're ramping investment R&D in the field and as I said a lot of momentum there. The other thing I would say about the inspection business is we have the best e-beam technology in the world, very strong in terms of e-beam review and we can leverage this technology for growth in new markets. But overall inspection is one of our highest margins one of our most profitable businesses.","In etch, the good news is that we're making tremendous progress and share this year, we\u2019re penetrating new applications and foundry planar NAND and we\u2019re extremely well-positioned and the first customer that's ramping 3D NAND. So, we are making very significant penetration, strong growth in the business. The margin\u2019s there aren\u2019t as good, they are not really different from where they were so there is no change in terms of the pricing behavior there it's just as we\u2019re ramping especially with new customer where we haven't been for a long time those initial margins are not great. The other thing I would say in etch is that we\u2019re working with technology leading companies, all of the technology leading companies on very differentiated products that have potential for significant share growth for us in the future.","So certainly we're penetrating today as I said in foundries and planar and 3D NAND but we also have very, very strong technology around some of the key future inflections in the etch business.","Tim Arcuri - Cowen & Company","","Great, thank you. That was very, very helpful. Thanks Gary.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","","Stephen Chin - UBS","Thanks. I also want to share my congrats to both Gary and Mike.","","Mike Splinter","Thank you.","","Gary Dickerson","Thanks Stephen.","","Stephen Chin - UBS","Just a follow-up question on planning for 2014 wafer fab equipment spending to be up 10% to 20%, I was just wondering if you could share kind of your latest color on how you think that may trend across memory, foundry, and logic, is it kind of memory and foundry or up, but maybe logic not up as much next year?","","Mike Splinter","Yes, certainly. Maybe I can just kind of run it down briefly for you, Stephen. I think if we would say that wafer fab equipment spending is up 10% to 20%, we think logic spending is probably going to be down as a percentage of the total. DRAM will probably be flat as a percentage of the total NAND and foundry up a bit as ahead of that 10% to 20%. And I think you can kind of relate that what\u2019s happening in the end market as well and with the technology inflections in 3D NAND and then the continued build out in the mobility area in the foundry space.","","Stephen Chin - UBS","Okay, thanks Mike. And then maybe a follow-up question, I think Bob called out that the number of evaluation tools are about 20% higher, maybe you can talk about where those evaluation tools are out is a mostly action inspection tools, is that what\u2019s given you some of the confidence that you can clearly gain share in those two new areas? Thanks.","","Gary Dickerson","Well, certainly in the etch market as I talked about earlier, we have some very, very strong technology around some major inflections. And we are penetrating logic, foundry, and memory customers with that new technology, so that certainly is one of our major areas of focus. We also in other areas like CVD, we are bringing to market new technology targeted at inflections, and we also have very strong pull from technology leading customers for these products. And so we believe and CVD will build momentum for share gains in 2014 and 2015 with some of these products and new applications. So, that\u2019s another area, but I would also say that as I mentioned we are increasing 300-millimeter R&D by $170 million run rate well along with some on the field support. And that really is translating into a great technology pipeline. So, it\u2019s certainly not just etch and CVD there are other areas where we have disruptive technology, but those are two of the prime areas.","","Stephen Chin - UBS","Thanks, Gary.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yes, good afternoon guys. Let me add my congratulations to both Mike and Gary. So, my first question guys, I kind of going to go back to one of the presentations at the Analyst Day over a month ago, will you talk about WFE spending being kind of $37 billion, I believe out in \u201816. I think I understand the positive impact of capital intensity on that number. I am wondering if you can help me understand how you guys think about spurring to the silicon growth and\/or the profitability of the customers over time relative to that number. And I guess what I am really trying to get out is we have seen this pretty significant mix shift down in the consumer market from the high end to the mid-range to the low-end, which probably doesn\u2019t reverse itself. I am kind of curious as how that dynamic need attraction in longer term forecast on capital spending?","","Mike Splinter","Thanks, John. That was a long question, but and a little further out question, I think how we tried to describe it at Analyst Day was really looking at process complexity increasing over these next few nodes to create the \u2013 we talked about the number of increased steps in 3D NAND, and those that would favor us, we also talked about the increased steps for vertical transistors, thin fabs, everybody is racing in that direction. And how much more difficult it is to be going to be to create these 10-nanometer or 7-nanometer patterns that our customers are going to be driving towards at that time. That\u2019s by far the biggest effect. And then the second part of it is really a continued build out of the smartphone and mobility mobile tablets over that period of time. We expect that growth rate is going to continue that way until essentially all phones are smartphones.","And I think we explained that in the event that there is just a significant amount more silicon that's been employed in one of those smartphones. And those are by far the biggest effects that kind of get us up to $37 billion wafer fab equipment spending range from where we\u2019re today. Also I think you know there has been pretty significant under investment in DRAM over the last few years. We certainly don't think DRAM is going away as a category.","And as the mobile build out happens it's going to return to a little bit larger bit growth than we've seen in the last few years.","","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities","At Analyst Day, you also talked about some development tools of record of 3D NAND and some in the last couple of weeks. Give us a little more insight into the 3D NAND performance metric that at the (inaudible) this week, I am kind of curious as if the (inaudible) have turned into product tools of record yet if they have how are you fairing and if they haven't when do you expect that to occur?","","Mike Splinter","Yeah we're very, very positive on our opportunity as the first customer ramps from planar to 3D NAND. We're seeing significant increase in market share especially in etch but our overall time and market share is definitely going up in that planar to 3D NAND transition. So I would say that the overall increase that we talked about around 25% in terms of the application or the total available market is about what we expected to be honest we\u2019re doing even better in etch in that transition than we had anticipated.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wes Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","","Wes Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Just real quickly I had a follow-up on the foundry orders the 20 nanometer foundry orders in particular. I\u2019m just wondering given the conviction that 20 nanometer foundry spending should rebound, are you seeing orders beyond the first large customer yet?","","Mike Splinter","On 20 nanometer orders, we're certainly seeing orders from more than one customer at this time. And maybe I can help you, our view is that by the end of '13 there'll be about 30,000 wafer starts capacity in the 20 nanometer range and we expect that growth rate upto over a 100,000 in 2014. So, I think we'll see acceleration as we approach the end of the year and then into 2014.","","Wes Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","And are you viewing 20 nanometers the same thing as the 16-14 nanometer the synthetic extension?","","Mike Splinter","Yeah. This is always a confusing thing is that everybody seems to be naming their own dimension. So we're kind of lumping all that kind of 20 to 16, 14 into one bucket so that we can obviously hide the specific name of the customer. It's going to be a big category and a big over the next few years the biggest part of the growth in wafers and in spending.","","Wes Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","This sounds a little tricky, but do you think given that would include the feel that extension would, do you think demand would be strong in the back half of 2014 than in the first half?","","Mike Splinter","I think it is probably bit too early for us to judge that right now I think right now our estimate really is that foundry spending will be up a little bit ahead of the overall 10% to 20% that we're thinking?","","Wes Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay and then just finally one thing that caught my attention was on the e-beam comment that you could leverage growth for that technology in new markets and I'm wondering if you could give us an idea of what new markets are you talking about moving into inspection or maybe even into (inaudible)?","","Mike Splinter","Yes again I really believe that we have the best e-beam technology, we haven\u2019t really capitalized on that as much as we could, but we have just introduced a new product and e-beam review. That\u2019s getting very strong poll and acceptance by customers. And definitely, I think we can leverage that into litho and we also can leverage that into e-beam inspection.","","Wes Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Alright, very helpful. Thank you.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Yes, thanks for taking my question. The first part of the question is for Mike, net interest income in about 20-nanometer and below, the size of the market could be about 100K, I am trying to better understand the thought process behind it, and let me get your view on the assumptions behind it, outside of Korea, I am sorry outside of Taiwan, Koreans are going to have rich production starting in December. And then at some point in \u201814 they are going to have puddle line, the same thing with global foundry. So, if the risk production for \u201814 is not going to happen until December, what gives you the confidence that 20 and below which going to have \u201814 in it could be as big as 100K unless you are making assumptions that 20 will dominate the 100K and I have a follow-up?","","Mike Splinter","Well, I think we have confidence that we get over 100K by the end of 2014, because the device makers need a refresh on technology. So, there will be a strong push to get that capability from the foundry suppliers. And whether we call it 20 or as I said 2016, \u201814 it will \u2013 the suppliers will \u2013 the foundry suppliers will meet demand, and we think there is a need for more than 100,000 wafers. And what we can see already from how the customers are lining up to buy product, it looks quite real to us.","","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","So, are you implying that the device-makers would, for the first time, would go from risk production to volume production in less than two quarters?","","Mike Splinter","Well, I think they have more than two quarters to do that actually.","","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","So, that means \u201814 especially for foundry could be pretty much back end loaded?","","Mike Splinter","I think \u201814 probably would be back end loaded, I agree, but certainly, 2016 is the major focus for most of our customers and most of them are planning pretty aggressive buys in 2014 for those nodes.","","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","And Gary for you, you highlighted your confidence in gaining market share in etch, what\u2019s the confidence there that gross margin there is not going to be sacrificed like what we are seeing in the process diagnostic?","","Gary Dickerson","Well, number one I wouldn\u2019t say the gross margin is being sacrificed in the process diagnostic space. That\u2019s actually one of our highest gross margin businesses in the whole company, very good gross margins, very profitable. And if I look out over the next few quarters that business is extremely profitable. In terms of the etch business, we have confidence in share based on what\u2019s happening with customers. We have strong poll in foundries for new applications and extremely strong poll in NAND technologies both for planer and especially as I said earlier for a 3D NAND. So, that is very strong. We know what the pricing is there. Again it is that one is at the lower end in terms of our gross margins today, but there is a lot of leverage as we grow that business. Also as I said, we have very strong technology around future inflections. We are working with all of the leading semiconductor companies in areas that have potential for extremely high growth. So, that\u2019s why we are optimistic on that business. Mike, you could also maybe give some color you have been in this for a while and maybe give a perspective on where we are today versus where we have been over the last 10 years.","","Mike Splinter","Well, I think on the opportunities for share gain Gary, I don\u2019t think we have ever had greater opportunity and how well we are positioned towards the real key inflections when you look across what needs to be done just in logic, we have to get to help our customers get to fit in production over the next 12 months. And I think we\u2019ve significant products there. We have to help reduce or improve the performance of interconnect and I think we\u2019ve great products there. Transistors are now being defined with metal gates. We see a big shift there as we move from gate first to gate last across the industry and then in 3D NAND, we got 3D NAND in time with really I think game-changing application. So as I said I don\u2019t think we have ever been in better position here.","","Todd Sloan","I will say again on etch that is one of lower gross margin product today. As we're growing that business with new customers, that's going to be a drag on our overall margins but the incremental profitability there is very, very good and we have tremendous traction around some of these major inflections and a very strong technology pipeline, good team. So, we have a lot of confidence that we're going to build this business into a strong contributor to profitable growth.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Terence Whalen with Citi.","","Terence Whalen - Citi","This question is question is on 3D NAND. Gary I think you said that the engagements with the customers are shifting fundamentally, occurring earlier and also developing more depth around the technology inflections. My question is, does this translate to better visibility or not in terms of actual slots? And also in terms of 3D NAND specifically, why would you have two customers up and running in terms of revenue? Thanks.","","Gary Dickerson","So in terms of visibility, one particular customer is leading the pack relative to the transition from planar to 3D NAND. They are very positive on the reliability and cost and moving forward very quickly. Visibility there relative to moving from development tool of record positions to production tool of record positions is very clear, that's happening. And as I said we\u2019re very positive on what's happening in that transition and maybe even it's little better than what we had expected. Relative to the other customers, the timing for the transition from planar to 3D NAND is little a behind the first customer I don't know that we want to comment right now on exactly when that transition would happen but definitely behind the first customer, we\u2019re working with those other customers on the technology development and we're also very optimistic in our opportunities as those customers make that transition.","","Terence Whalen - Citi","My other question is related to the China regional breakdown information you've shown for both revenue and orders. We saw a pretty significant increase in revenue sequentially in the July quarter and also a decent increase in orders. My question is, what is that reflective of? Is it reflective of display or is it actually reflective of some orders and shipments into China perhaps for an international customer thanks and 3D NAND. Thanks.","","Gary Dickerson","I think that was the China display orders. We got some big TV business in China.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank","I wanted to just understand better understand your thoughts on restructuring given in the ES business your targets for the next year. Do you have any plan of change in your thought process given the progress you've made so far?","","Mike Splinter","Well we've made significant cuts in OpEx there in the last year. I think it's on the order of about a $120 million in the run rate OpEx cuts and in the solar business. The web business is actually doing very well. We don't talk about that very much, but that business is exceeding our expectations and pretty profitable.","Relative to the solar businesses or any businesses within the company, we're not married to any particular business. We\u2019ve operating profit goals that we have for businesses, businesses that meet those goals. We're going to invest and grow businesses that don\u2019t meet that threshold. We will not continue in those businesses over the long-term.","","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank","Great, thank you. And then you had talked about $800 million of orders for your display business, can you share and then you also mentioned today that you see a path to above $1 billion of revenue and record margins in that segment. So, can you share your thoughts on how we should think about display spending in 2014 and also whether you can see double-digit growth in that segment in 2014? Thank you.","","Mike Splinter","I think we are very encouraged by the level of orders right now in this phase of the cycle. They are really showing our share gains in PVD, in particular. As you know, we have always been strong in CVD, but right now we see that TV investments going to continue. We have been pleasantly surprised by the growth in the size of TVs, but at Gen 8.5, this kind of 55 to 60 plus inch TVs are very, very cost effective now. We think in the marketplace we are going to see the prices come down and continue to see this very fast expansion in size of TVs. And then if you look in our display business, we have the foundation on the mobile business that corresponds to the rest of our mobility products. So, that really creates the floor on revenue in our display business. So, I think with the growth in PVD share, we are going to see significant performance next year. And I think Bob loves this business, because he just thinks that we are going to be able to get great leverage on the bottom line here as we amortize that infrastructure.","","Bob Halliday","Yes, I think this is good business model. I mean, these folks manage really tightly in downturns and really optimize the business in the upturn. So, I like the business.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company","Thanks for taking my question. A follow-up question on display, if I look at your booking year-to-date has been pretty up \u2013 it\u2019s a lot higher than your revenue year-to-date, why you are guiding down for the October quarter?","","Mike Splinter","Just lead time issue Edwin. I think you are going to see continued strong orders over the next few quarters. But as you know, this business is quite lumpy with long lead times. We are working those down, but it\u2019s still from the time our customers ordered till the time they startup their factories. So, oftentimes over a year or so, it\u2019s all about lead time versus the orders.","","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company","I see. Okay, great. And then a question for you Bob, if I look at your OpEx guidance for the coming quarter and I contrast that against what your longer term target right it seems like your OpEx guidance is really at the long-term OpEx target of $2.1 billion, right. I guess to my question or one is, is that any kind of one-time statement you are realizing this quarter or are we done with OpEx, and I guess the other point I want to figure out is how much more do you think you can spend in R&D as a percentage of total OpEx?","","Bob Halliday","Yes, I think we have made pretty good progress. There is three buckets I guess of OpEx is the cost of doing business that which is all the support functions and is the R&D investment which is what you choose to invest in. And we have a lot of good investment opportunities right now Gary talked about. The third which is the field a lot of that is pushing some of our growth with the technical marketing guys in the field, so, I think in the R&D and the technical marketing guys as investments and the rest is the cost of doing business. And the cost of doing business, I can sort of see over the next two years sustainably keep improving our performance in the area, and I can sort of see the roadmap.","So, I think on the R&D investments, those are choices we select. And I think if you think of that, those kind of investments, it\u2019s like a pipe. What you are seeing in the short-term right now is we are really optimizing the investments that were halfway down that pipeline of products. What we have done now is we have increased the diameter of the pipe by funding, but we have also increased the velocity going through the pipe. So, in terms of spending, I think the cost of doing business will keep improving that over the next two years. I think the velocity of stuff out of the pipeline in terms of R&D, I am pretty excited about once those things start to hit. And right now, we are optimizing things, we\u2019re half way down the pipe whether it's inspection or etch but we have some very some aggressive plans right now for stuff coming out of the pipe, so when those come out of pipe which will be over the next year to two, what you'll see is the red (ph) line will start to grow the OpEx spending as a percentage that goes. So right now we're spending on R&D a little bit higher than our revenue line, we\u2019re funding with the G&A stuff but as we get that pipe really flowing the R&D will probably stay more constant and G&A will get optimized and revenues the margins will go up.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.","","Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray","Two questions, how should we be thinking about 3D NAND orders sustainability in calendar '14 given that capital intensity is very high and the customers besides one customer are looking at second half '15 or into 2016. How should we think about this as one customer tries to debug the ire challenges as well as the retention challenges some things like that? And I have a follow up.","","Mike Splinter","Yeah. I don't want to talk for any specific customer relative to what their plans are. What I would say is that, what we\u2019re hearing is that, they are pretty positive in terms of the progress they've made on that particular device and I think it's pretty well known that first stage is ramping and certainly if that is successful, they are going to continue to be fairly aggressive.","","Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then for as a follow up then. Mike, given your commentary that 2014 WFE spend is going to be up 10% to 20% and Gary's commentary about the increasing SAM opportunities, how should be think about silicon system orders overall for calendar '14 in terms of looking at vis-a-vis calendar '13 and how should be looking at it's overall profitability? Thank you.","","Mike Splinter","Well, maybe I should let Bob answer this question but I would just say that with our share gains and with the mix of spending at least the way we think of it now with foundry growing a bit faster than the main and our NAND flash growing faster than the main these are two good things for Applied Materials. So we\u2019re not trying to forecast our full 2014 right now but I think the growth and the mix and the share gain are all heading in our direction.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.","","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","First, in terms of the process control opportunities you see ahead, you've talked a lot about the share gain opportunities. How do you see that TAM (ph) particularly on the foundry and logic side increasing as you go from 20 nanometers to the 16 and 14 nanometer FinFET notes?","","Mike Splinter","Well. I think that the TAM more than likely will go up as you go to those different technology notes. I think the key thing for us the really key thing that moves the needle for us is our layer qualification. That's one of the things that we watch very, very closely. And what we talked about was a significant increase in the layers when you look at the 28, 20 and also we're working very closely with leaders in FinFET technology. So that layer qualification for us went up something like 30% this year and that we believe is very positive for us. It gives us very positive momentum from a market share perspective","","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","And my follow up question maybe for Bob in terms of the operating model specifically with the AGS business. And I think that this is an opportunity you've mentioned in the past where you can improve the overall margins of that business segment. One, what kind of improvements have you made to-date and two what are some of the longer term I guess efforts or initiatives you want to put in place to get those margins higher in that segment?","","Gary Dickerson","Sure. I think the opportunity on AGS is a pretty good revenue opportunity which drops down a high percentage of that drops down. So if you look at that business we sell a lot of spare parts, our own tools. So I think we could probably hold better share in that business and that's a function of sourcing correct \u2013 optimizing programs with customers and internal alignment on how that you do that when you first design the tools and then also as the tools released. I look at that as a really good opportunity, because the drop from profit in that business is pretty good. It\u2019s also a really good cash flow business frankly, because the operating expenses once you set up the infrastructure are pretty low incremental cost. I like that business a lot. I think we got to implement some of things, which we are working on right now, again, good coordination internally. And we just keep chopping away at it, hacking away at it, or building one maybe that\u2019s the right word, because I think it\u2019s more of a building revenue thing on this side.","","Michael Sullivan","Thanks Patrick. And then Dustin, I know we have run past hour, but would you please poll Krish Sankar and see if he might still be back on the line?","","Operator","And the question line is open.","","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Hi, can you hear me?","","Mike Splinter","Yes.","","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, sorry about the earlier technical issue and congrats again to Gary and Mike. Two quick questions. One, Mike, you mentioned about DRAM capacity adds next year, I know they are just like one, two, three DRAM customers out there. Do you expect one or more than one customer to add capacity? And I had a quick follow up to Bob.","","Mike Splinter","We would expect one or two to add and the third one to optimize their overall capacity.","","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then a quick one for Bob, Bob you spoke about the increase in eval tools next quarter. I just wanted to figure out are these one year evals and how will it affect the expenses over the next year or so given that you won\u2019t be generating revenue from them, but still supporting them?","","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Most of it are approximately one year, still the somewhat of an incremental expense, but the leverage on these things is pretty high, because remember, when you put an eval tool into a fab, the customer mix just as big in economic commitment as we do. So, it is a really positive indicator that they are going to buy your tools in some volumes. So, we kind of like high leverage eval tools. The cost of these is not here, it\u2019s sort of in the marketing budget we talked about in terms of investing and most of these are in that forecast.","","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great.","","Michael Sullivan","Thanks Krish.","","Gary Dickerson","Thanks.","","Michael Sullivan","We would like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you. In a moment, we\u2019ll discuss the results for our fourth quarter and 2016 fiscal year which ended on October 30th. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements including Applied\u2019s current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions, profitability and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, and are not guarantees of future performance.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today\u2019s earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor\u2019s page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks Mike. I\u2019m very delighted to report that Applied Materials delivered record revenue and earnings in our fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding year. In fiscal 2016, we grew orders, revenue and earnings to the highest levels in the Company's history and made significant progress towards our longer term strategic and financial goals. Some of our major accomplishments this year include our highest semiconductor orders in revenues since the year 2000 and record performance in display and service where both groups exceeded all time highs for orders and revenue.","I want to thank all of our employees for their passion to create value for our customers and for making 2016 a great year for Applied. Looking ahead, I see tremendous capabilities, momentum and opportunities across the Company. This gives me increased confidence that we will again drive sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond.","In today's call, I'll start by explaining some of the key factors contributing to our record performance and describe our strategy for long-term sustainable growth. I'll then provide our market view and describe why Applied has an increasingly positive outlook. I'll conclude with brief updates on our major businesses. After that Bob will provide additional details about our results as well as historical perspective on our future outlook.","At Applied our strategy of inflection focused innovation leadership is delivering profitable growth; in both semiconductor display, large multiyear inflections are enabled by materials innovation. Applied has by far the broadest and deepest capabilities in materials engineering. It's our ability to combine these competencies technologies and products that really sets us apart and allows us to sustainably grow faster than the markets we serve. To fuel growth, we focused our organization investments to deliver highly differentiated solutions that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before.","At the same time, we've implemented a new operating system for the Company that's driving repeatable success and increasing our product hit rate. A key element of this is our product development engine. We've already trained more than 5,000 engineers, how to use these methods and as a result we now see inflection sooner develop solutions faster and generate higher residual value from our large installed base of tools.","Over the past few quarters, I talked about five major market drivers that are contributing to our record performance today and will fuel growth for years to come. These drivers are leading edge foundry in logic, 3D NAND, patterning, advance display in China. At our analyst event in September, we gave comprehensive updates on these five drivers. So, today I'll only cover two where we've new information to share.","Let me start with patterning, at the analyst meeting we said we expect our patterning opportunity to expand to around $3 billion by 2019, growing 2.3 times since 2012. In recent weeks new details about EUV adoption have been made public and this gives us increased confidence in these projections. Our model is consistent with others and assumes that EUV will primarily be used for cuts and vias in foundry and logic applications. That's about 20% of the total patterning market.","For the other 80%, we see customers expanding multi-patterning solutions and this significantly grows our addressable market. Pulling all this together, we believe that in the most aggressive case for EUV adoption, our 2019 patterning opportunity will still grow to around $3 billion as previously forecasted. In scenarios where EUV adoption rates are slower than the most optimistic case, our patterning growth could be significantly higher.","Looking beyond 2019, we see cuts and vias remaining the primary application for EUV, and our patterning opportunity continuing to expand.","Patterning is an area where Applied is making significant investments, and has room to grow. We have already gained around 15 points of market share since 2012. We see strong customer poll for new materials-enabled patterning processes where we have innovated new technologies and believe we can gain another 15 points of share by 2019.","My second update relates to display, we announced that our equipment has been selected for the world's first gen 10.5 LCD Tv Fab. The push gen 10.5 is driven by rapid growth in the market for a large format TVs, 60 inches and above. A gen 10.5 substrate is about 80% bigger than the current gen 0.85 standard allowing customers to optimize output for larger screens. In addition demand for our old lab manufacturing equipment is broadening with this strength in both TV and mobile we are increasing our estimate for 2017 display capital spending. We now believe customers will invest around $2 billion more than 2016.","In the past few weeks, we have also increased our forecast for wafer fab equipment. We now expect 2016 wafer fab equipment spending will be at least 5% higher than in 2015, driven by additional foundry capacity and incremental investment in 3D NAND. At the same time, our view of 2017 is strengthening. We believe spending will be higher this year with logic and foundry investment remaining at robust levels and growth in memory spending.","Looking further ahead, I am very excited about emerging trends and virtual and augmented reality, big data and artificial intelligent, and smart vehicles. These new drivers for semiconductor and display span consumer enterprise and industrial applications and layer on top up existing demand from mobility, PCs and other consumer electronics. Our discussions with leading companies in these areas make it clear that these new applications create huge demand for memory and required major advancers in silicon technology. These trends at to my view that demand for capital equipment is becoming less cyclical and normalized annual spending is increasing overtime.","I'll now talk about the progress we are making in each of major businesses. In semiconductor, we are seeing robust demand across the Board, and as we said in September, we expect 2016 to be a strong shared gain year for Applied. Growth in our leadership business is being driven by foundry and logic inflections and also by memory as Epitaxy, implants and rapid thermal processing are adopted in 3D NAND. In particular, we see strong growth in CMP while we have increased revenue around 60% since 2012 and metal CVD where we expect double digit share gain this year.","Our leadership businesses are in a really great position to grow. In 2016, we converted well over 90% of our development positions to volume production wins. We\u2019re also making significant market share gains in edge and CVD. Fiscal 2016 was our third consecutive year of growth in CVD and fourth consecutive year of growth in edge where revenues reached a 9-year high. Overall our combined edge and CVD revenues exceeded $2.7 billion for the year. I\u2019m very excited by our product pipeline line in edge and ALD. We\u2019re seeing rapid adoption of our innovative new solutions, including selective edge and Olympia ALD that together generated more than $230 million of revenue this year.","I\u2019m also pleased by the progress we\u2019re making in advanced packaging. We have some great new products and based on the positions we\u2019re winning, we expect to double our packaging revenues over the next 12 months. In inspection and process control, we also delivered our highest ever orders and revenue this year. In 2016, we believe that we will gain 20 point of e-beam inspection around 7 points of share in e-beam overall and secure the number one position in this market. E-beam is the fastest growing segment in inspection, and we\u2019re winning new applications that support sustainable share gain for years to come.","In service, our strategy is to deliver more values to customers with our advanced service products. Our service teams are more tightly a line with our products groups ever before they are reducing ramp times, improving device performance and yield and optimizing output and operating cost for customers. In the fourth quarter, we set new records for both orders and revenue, and when we look at year-over-year comparisons, we\u2019ve now grown our service business every single quarter for the past three years. Display is also setting records with two inflections driving growth.","The first is large format TVs driving investment in new gen 10 capacity. Large format TV units are expected to grow at 50 % to 20% annually over the next three year, compared to single digit growth rates for TV\u2019s overall. The second is OLED where investment is increasing as multiple customers start to ramp this technology and battle for leadership in next generation mobile screen. At our Analyst Meeting, we said that our market opportunity in display is expanding significantly up to 10 times in the case of OLED. We are focused on building our product portfolio to deliver the solutions our customers need to transition to new display products over the next few years. We have great traction with our new thin- film encapsulation and e-beam review products and have more significant new products that will be announced in 2017.","In Summary, I strongly believe this is Applied's time. We set new performance records in 2016 and we\u2019re seeing impact of the investment we\u2019ve made in our organization and product pipeline over the past several year. As we look ahead to 2017 and beyond, we see strengthen our markets as large multiyear inflection continue to evolve a new emerging demand drives layer on time of mobility and computing. Across the Company, we\u2019re focused on extending our innovation relations. Applied solutions are enabling customers to build new devices and structures that we will never possible before. This puts us in a unique position to drive sustainable growth and raise the ceiling on our financial performance.","Now, let me hand the call over to Bob, who\u2019ll provide more details about our results and outlook. Bob?","Bob Halliday","Thanks, Gary. In September, we raised the ceiling on our expectations for our markets and our company. Since then we've increased our 2016 WFE forecast to a range of $33.5 billion to $34 billion. Our internal projection for 2017 WEF is a $1 billion dollars higher than that and it assumes only modest DRAM investment, China spending and NAND penetration of hard drives. So our early view on 2018 in the longer term horizon is positive as well. So while our Analyst Day was just eight weeks ago I already feel more confident in our ability to hit our 2019 financial model.","After the Analyst Day, the slide that sparks most interest was the one comparing average WFE spending and the standard deviation around the average for two periods 2000 through 2009, and 2010 through 2016. What really caught everyone's attention was the one standard deviation fell from $8 billion in the earlier period to $2.07 billion. The WFE industry has evolved since 2010 and that preserves some discussion. I'll give you the major factors that lead me to believe it's a fundamentally more stable and attractive business.","First, the semiconductor industry we serve has become larger, more diversified and less volatile. Specifically semi-content was led by PCs, which have multiyear demand cycles time to enterprise upgrades. Now we've added mobility which has annual consumer replacement cycles and generates more semi-revenues than PCs. And today, we are layering on additional semi-demand drivers including big data, IoT, cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and self-driving cars.","Second, the cycles of the past were mainly driven by PC DRAM, which was the largest most competitive and most generic technology. Today, DRAM is near the bottom in spending. There are fuel producers and the design have been tailored the servers and mobile devices including multichip stacks, it's not longer one size fits all.","Third, NAND spending has surpassed DRAM and NAND continues to unlock growth potential as the gigabyte cost approaches hard drives.","Fourth, foundry capacity additions tend to be contract base and demand driven rather than supply driven, and foundry has gone from being the smallest category to the biggest today.","Fifth, our customers now add capacity on the more flexible basis building out lines and line extensions instead of entire mega fabs. Not only has the industry change, but Applied has changed in ways to give us larger and might more diverse revenues and profits.","Over the past few years, we have achieved relatively balanced market share across all of the semiconductor device types. Most of our businesses are now benefitting from 3D NAND and our success in NAND has been a springboard to our new patterning wins in DRAM. At the same time, we have greatly expanded our service business whose revenues are up by over 30% in just the past three years. By 2019, there is relatively stable business should deliver almost a quarter of our revenue and an even greater percentage of our operating profits and Applied is uniquely positioned as the equipment leader in display.","We're on track to triple our overall opportunity with new display products, and we're accelerating on display pipeline by leveraging our semiconductor IP including e-beam, identifying new technologies through Applied ventures and securing R&D co-funding. In both semi and display, we can point to specific inflections and winning products that will drive our growth through the model period and beyond. And in all of our markets, I believe we're demonstrating systemic improvements in our ability to outperform. The better allocation spending, more efficient execution and product development engine are now culturally ingrained.","Now, what's the significance of this greater stability, I'll mention just three things. First, our order variations now reflect seasonality more than cyclicality. We're focused on driving year-over-year revenue in earnings growth, and we plan to stop reporting quarterly orders as of 2016. To help you feel comfortable with this change, I'm telling you know that I expect our Q1 of fiscal '17 orders to be meaningfully higher in both semi and display. I also plan to detail our Q1 orders on the February call, so you can have a complete set of data for your calendar '16 models.","Second, this stability gives us unique opportunity to get closer to our customers and here's why. The technology roadmaps are getting harder, so customers increasingly want to work with the most capable suppliers, and we're the broadest and most capable. Today, our customers are asking us to engage earlier and ramp new enabling technologies much sooner and more aggressively, this costs money. But the most stable business environment gives us confidence that we can invest more in our customers' roadmaps and generate more attractive risk adjusted returns.","Number three, the stability helps us deliver higher, more predictable profits and increased cash flow. It's great for our financial stability. Eight weeks ago, we've showed you our 2019 financial model. Some of you realized that we plan to generate substantial free cash flow well beyond what's needed to achieve our share count objective. We regularly evaluate the best means of returning excess cash to shareholders, and we know some shareholders value dividend growth as much as buybacks. We're evaluating our options for this additional liquidity, and we're monitoring the tax policy environment for any changes that could influence our thinking about the mix.","Now, I'll shift gears and comment on our performance during Q4; I'll focus on our revenues and profits as compared to the same period last year. We grew company revenue by 39% year-over-year and more than doubled our non-GAAP earnings per share. We increased non-GAAP gross margin by 1.5 points year-over-year and our spending discipline helped us to increase non-GAAP operating profit by 82% year-over-year. The non-GAAP cash rate was a little lower than expected due a favorable geographic mix. At the segment level, we grew semiconductor systems revenue by 42% year-over-year and segment non-GAAP operating margin by 9.1 points. We increased service revenues by 13% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating profit by 1.9 points, and we grew display revenue by 92% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating profit by 10.9 points.","Moving to the balance sheet, we delivered strong operating cash flow of $797 million in Q4 or 24% of revenue. We grew total cash in investments to $4.68 billion after returning $279 million to shareholders through buyback and dividends. For the year, we distributed 106% of free cash flow to shareholders. At yearend about 14% of cash in investments were onshore. The onshore balance has increased to roughly 45%, reflecting the effects of intercompany transactions.","Now, I\u2019ll provide our guidance for the first quarter 2017. We expect our overall revenue to be close to the record levels set in Q4. Our expectation represents year-over-year growth of approximately 45%, plus or minus 3 points. Within this outlook, semiconductor systems revenue should be near the 15 year high achieved in Q4. This forecast represents year-over-year growth of about 55% plus or minus 3 points. Services revenue is seasonally lower in Q1, but we expected to be up by about 10% year-over-year plus or minus 2 points. And display revenue should be up by about 65% year-over-year plus or minus 10 points.","Our non-GAAP earnings per share should be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70. The midpoint of which would be up by 154% year-over-year. As a reminder Q1 of 2016 was a 14 week quarter. Since as the first quarter of a new year, I'll help you with your modeling question. In Q1 non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be up by about 0.1 from 43.7% in Q4 reflecting very positive mix. For the full year, we expect gross margin to reach approximately 44%, which will bring us to within 60 basis points and the midpoint of our 2019 model. Non-GAAP OpEx is likely to be $625 million in Q1 plus or minus $10 million. Our quarterly run rate in the balance of the year maybe approximately $635 million which will remain below the model. Our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to be around 11% which is after model. And we will continue to buy back shares to achieve the share count target in the model.","In summary, we delivered new levels of revenue and profitability in 2016, and demonstrated the benefits of the strategy we have been working to implement over the past several years, but this is just the beginning. The industry is bigger and more attractive. Our opportunity set is larger. Our customer relationships are stronger and our new product pipeline is better than ever. We raise the ceiling with our 2019 target financial model, and we are making excellent progress already. Our stronger performance is sustainable and we are confident in our ability to deliver increasingly predictable cash returns to our shareholders.","Now Mike, let's start the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have any additional question later, please call the operator and we will do our best to answer that later in the call. Operator let\u2019s please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.","C.J. Muse","If you look back your or at least what the implied guide for calendar 16 for Q4, you're growing roughly 24% plus, and if you think about mix, next year I\u2019m assuming, growing display, growing NAND. How should we think about your relative outperformance to the rest of the industry?","Gary Dickerson","Sure, in our fiscal year and our calendar year next year, we think in the semi, it\u2019s going to be healthier in general for the environment. We feel good about environment. We\u2019re going to gain shares. We don\u2019t want to exact numbers right now, but we\u2019re gain WFE shares in year in a number of place. And then in display, we see display revenues up significant amount next year. And then, we see the service business continue to grow. So we will outperform the market we're in, but additionally we think the markets are pretty good next year. Our outlook is WFE up. Our outlook is that spending on cap on display equipments is up and service again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Bob, you talked about the 2017 WFE being up about a $1 billion dollars, based on modest expectation for the DRAM, China and NAND. Can you dig a little bit deeper into those three items and give a little color as to what you're assuming the model?","Bob Halliday","Sure, part of what we were answering that was that we think its wended back into the '18 too. So, if you look at '17, we think, NAND is up next year. We think foundry strong and we think logic is pretty good. DRAM is up some next year, but what we don\u2019t see as high levels of absolute DRAM spending because this year is not too big. What we\u2019re modeling and we might be a little conservative, it's not a big change in China spending, we think that hits more in '18, if you just look at buildings and shelves and stuffs like that.","We are big believers China is going happen. So we think we\u2019ve wended our back into '18 based on our few things. We things China ramps fair mount amore in '18. We think DRAM probably is upside in '18, not to mention semis altered form memories we're starting to see early now. And thirdly, NAND might be end of next year probably going to get about 7,000 wafer starts, something about 1.4 million. And we think all of that eventually get, virtually all of that gets converted. So, we think there is still strong NAND spending in \u201918.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J. P Morgan.","Harlan Sur","What are the key takeaways from of the analyst meeting was the order trajectory right, so specifically book to bill as a leading indicator of the revenue and earnings power momentum, past four years you guys have had book to bill greater than one, and obviously clearly an indicator of the growth of the business. As you look at your customer and program pipeline for fiscal '17, combined with your view on growth in flat panel and WSE in which we're spending growth, is 2017 likely to be the fifth consecutive year of book to bill greater than one for the team?","Gary Dickerson","Well while we said earlier on the call was that we see our bookings continuing strong, but the relative books quarter-to-quarter in particular we\u2019re going to stop reporting booking after Q1. We're going to you in Q1, Q1 we see up meaningfully and what we mean by meaningfully is up more than strong double digits, okay from Q4. So people have been worried that peaked in Q3 bookings down some in Q4. We see a strong Q1 and we see a strong year overall.","So, we think the momentum is still with us, and our revenues are going to be up, and our shares are going to up next year. In terms of quarterly variability and orders, I'm not sure. In terms of book to bill next year, we don\u2019t have clarity on the second half. Here, it's too early first to tell. But we see a strong WFE year share up, strong spending on display. Frankly, it's more strong in both of those than we saw it eight weeks ago for instance period that large TVs are doing well, the gen 10 stuff, the profitability at the displays guys is good.","So, we see display is pretty down strong next year, we see breadthening demand for mobile display up to nine or ten people trying to make OLED displays, not the mobile. And then within WFE, we're getting a lot of pull from customers to increase production and shipments. So, we think overall as next year we think we're going to get very healthy bookings whether it's where it is relative to one I don\u2019t know right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company.","Tim Arcuri","Bob, I'm curious on China, how much you are putting in? I know that you think China is sort of generally more of a 2018 thing than a 2017 things, but I'm wondering if you can give us some numbers in terms of what is embedded in your WFE forecast in next for China versus what is was this year? Thanks.","Bob Halliday","Well, I'd tell you what\u2019s in -- I'll give you a sense of what's in the numbers and I'll give you my qualitative assessment on the numbers a little bit. We think it's down little bit next year, but the numbers there stays down over the next year, but we think it's flat. So, I think I'm probably conservative on that. So what buried in my numbers is down little bit, but we think that is probably upside that. Gary is shaking his head, but he definitely doesn\u2019t think it's down next year.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, I would say that Applied was strong in all regions including China. And as we've talked about before, it's one of the strongest regions in semi and display. Right now, it looks like '17 is going to be roughly the same as '16, but it's up a pretty significant amount from where we were a couple of years ago. 2018, we think could be meaningfully up above the 2017 forecast. So those were my thoughts.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup.","Atif Malik","Question for Gary, Gary thanks for the update on the patterning with the base and double case on EUV and then on the display side, can you just give us a little different update or preview on what's some of the new products that you are looking on, on the OLED side plan to achieve? Are these products meant to remove the supply chain bottlenecks? Or are they going to target some of the cost ownership or other technology challenges?","Gary Dickerson","Our strategy overall is inflection focused innovation and what we've talked about in display is an opportunity to triple our served market over the next few years. The team of display is really-really an outstanding team driving innovative new products, targeting major customer inflections and you can already see growth in display with thin-film encapsulation and e-beam, two products that we've introduced in the last couple of years that are really generating meaningful revenue for the display business.","And so, we're really continuing the same playbook, we're focused on in selections that are meaningful for our customers. We have very strong pull and investment from customers in these new products and high confidence that these new businesses will add meaningful revenue for our display business and increased confidence that we're going to hit or exceed the model that we showed for 2019. We will disclose more about the specific products in 2017, next year.","Michael Sullivan","And then I think Atif has asked two questions, even though I asked for one, and I wonder if you could comment on the EUV?","Gary Dickerson","We talked about patterning at our investor meeting in New York and we see patterning as a great opportunity. We forecasted about $3 billion TAM by 2019, and when we look at EUV adoption we agree with others that the view of EUV is going to be mostly focused on vias and cuts in logic. So when you look at the leading customer roadmaps, vias and cuts in logics is about 20% of the total patterning TAM, 80% of the TAM will continue to add multi-patterning and that gives us increased confidence in the $3 billion estimate that we had at our investor meeting.","Basically, if you take the most aggressive EUV assumption for adoption, something like 10 layers adopted at five nanometer logic for vias and cuts, you come up to the $3 billion estimate, of course if it's not in this most aggressive assumption then the TAM could be higher. And Applied is really in a great position to gain share, we talked about a $1 billion number in our model for 2019 for Applied, and we've great confidence in that number. We've already gained 15 points of share in patterning since 2012. We're forecasting at least 50% more between now and 2019, really great products in edge, in selective removal, CVD, ALD, CMP, really-really-really great new products and we've line of sight to the 2019 model with many application wins and increasing customer poll for these innovative new products.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.","Stephen Chin","So, I've a follow-up question on your 2017 view on foundry logic WFE, does your 2017 view assume will be much foundry logic customer reuse of 10 nanometer equipment for the 7 nanometer node? Or is it assumed limited equipment reused by foundry logic? Thanks.","Gary Dickerson","Sure, let me -- we've had a couple of questions and peak questions and let me give you some context on how we look at the business, and then I'll answer specific question, Stephen. We actually really believe three things.","One, that the industry is growing more-and-more attractively in which we compete, total spending is trending up, and volatility is trending down in both WFE and in capital spending for displays.","Secondly, Applied I think is trending up in terms of the breadth of our product offerings and reduced volatilities. We've the similar share across NAND, foundry, DRAM, and logic. We're gaining share. We've a deep product pipeline. So, I think the second thing is the trend is the industry is looking good. The trend is Applied is becoming more-and-more attractive and less volatile.","And third, those things combined produced very predictable cash flow, which we could talk about later on the call, gives us opportunity to return cash to investors. In terms of risk that there's some replacement reused in 10 and 7 in next year. I think it's pretty moderate frankly. I think 10 is not going to be a big node. I think people are going to rush to go to 7, but 10 nanometer devices are shipping next year, 7 the year after. So the ability to migrate equipment is somewhat limited.","The second thing is the comparison and everybody always gives us the 20 to 16 flash 14 migrations that would distinct in a couple ways. One you had the biggest consumers of computer chips in the world switch from one vendor to another in a node. And secondly, you have gone for the last planar of FinFET device to -- last planer to first FinFET, which really made the last device unattractive. So is it going to be reused sometime equipment from 10 to 7? Yes, so I don\u2019t think its next year and I think it's going to be much smoother than it was in '15?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America.","Krish Sankar","I'll make a two part question Bob. One as you mentioned the business is getting more seasonal versus cyclical, when you look at the order trend, you had dip in orders for semis in the October quarter. Is that the seasonality you are talking about on a go forward basis and along the same pattern you look in to calendar '17. Can you help us understand dig a little more deeper in how the WFE profile looks like first half versus second half for NAND, DRAM, foundry and logic?","Bob Halliday","Yes, I do believe that as we said on the call, the previous part of the call, I do think it's more seasonal than cyclical. We have a lot of data that shows that some friends even if you look as we said, the script we got asked the most questions about at the Analyst Day was this average WFE spending since 2010 is up to like 31.7 billion. I think it is with the volatility about 2.8 versus 2009, it was like 25.5 with a volatility of 8 billion. I'll give you more details on that. If you look at memory as a sum because virtually every customer makes DRAM and NAND, the average before 2010 one standard deviation, one sigma was 6 billion on an average spent of 10.7. Since 2010, its $3 billion standard deviation on an average spent of 12 when you put DRAM and NAND together.","The second thing is virtually every year there is 2012 I think it is, it\u2019s a pretty much 1 billion to 2 billion every year total memory spending. Now if you get loss in the weeds between DRAM and NAND, it's all different. But the companies manage their budget that way. They still got to put DRAM this year and NAND in that year, RAM fab this year the other fab next year. And then on foundry, foundry spending before 2010, it was $2 billion on an average, if the standard deviation was 2 billion FinEET was 1.5 billion on the spent of 12 brand, and the spend pre-2010 average 4.5. So the magnitude of these standard deviations the volatility is going down, really it's seasonally not cyclical.","In terms of to your specific question about I guess this was about next year, we are not exactly sure, I'll give us some data for us. We think our Q1 bookings were up. We think our year WFE is up. We think our share is up. Just because the data, we think year-over-year it\u2019s a chance that every quarter year-over-year is up. So I think in terms of the seasonality specifically asked on foundry. Historically spending on WFE and foundry, foundry is the one to tend to be a little more seasonal because it's Christmas and Chinese New Year. They historically are taking equipment more March through August, end of February through August. And then they might have another spur if they need more latter in the year.","This year it was a little different because one of the big foundry customers is trying to more level low themselves and get head start on 10 nanometer. So we have little bit different cycle in terms of spending because remember 10 NAND is shipping from next year. And then the other thing in May this year little different is, there is just sustained demand for 3D NAND. So we had started at the beginning of year, we have a pull at the end of the year. So the seasonal which is kind of more cyclicality is being mapped to be a technology transition, which is very helpful too. And again that\u2019s not so much cyclical, it\u2019s more of technology trend that\u2019s going to go in for years.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","My first question is regarding the Jan quarter orders outlook, on the prior call you had kind of indicated that orders would flattish in the Jan quarter from October. I just want to understand like what has improved and how do you see the orders can buy different segment evidence as switching?","Gary Dickerson","I\u2019m trying get up my borders bad habit, but I'll try to help a little bit. What we said last quarter to make, we a put a floor because we have spiked up a lot in every metric you can measure last few quarter, orders, revenue EPS. We want to give people a sense. We\u2019re going to continue strong that our share gains, our revenue growth our operating margin expansion was sustainable. So what we said last quarter was, hey, orders are not going to fall for cliff. The numbers are going to start with three in the next two quarters Q4, and Q1, and in fact they will start with the three and in fact the three was a little bit lot of -- we thought it will be little higher in Q4. And some of those one in the Q1, so we think we\u2019re up double digits in Q1. So, it\u2019s prior a little bit timing and the magnitude is quite little stronger because where we\u2019re getting pull is on some flash devices like that 3D NAND. So, it\u2019s strong and it\u2019s probably stronger even thought 2 months ago.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Romit Shah from Nomura Securities.","Romit Shah","It just seems that AI machine learning and self-driving car adoption coming along a lot of faster than we thought at the start of the year. And we know these applications are iterative and very compute intensive. And I\u2019m wondering, if this could be, all this could be an incremental driver next year for your memory and logic businesses?","Gary Dickerson","I don\u2019t about next year but I would say that we\u2019re definitely increasingly bullish about the longer term. We\u2019ve talked about five drivers in our model between now and 2019. This multiyear way, so we\u2019re very confident in those drivers, and we\u2019ve talked about that in the prepared remarks. But I would say definitely increasingly bullish relative to the longer term opportunity, as we\u2019re engaged with some of the leading technology companies, around cognitive computing, smart vehicles you saw, big announcement from Samsung this week with an $8 billion acquisition. There is incredible amount of money being spent. And when you look at these drivers, VR, AR, smart vehicles, cognitive computing, all of these different areas.","You need a higher performance computing and we had the CEO of one company that was here recently, and we were talking about logic devices, what are the size of those logic devices going to be? And basically he said, as big as I can build them, as big as I can fit it into radical field. And he was also talking about the amount of memory that's going to be needed for some of the future applications. And it\u2019s much, much bigger than I think any of us could imagine. So I would think, we are much more bullish about the longer term relative to the drivers for high performance computing and for memory. I'm also bullish about the innovation pipeline that we have within Applied Materials.","I really believe that the 500 million per year that we've moved in terms of innovation, we are already enabling people to design devices that they could not have dreamed of building a few years ago, and I strongly believe that the pipeline we have now the best is still coming in that pipeline. So I'm really bullish about the market. Bob talked about where we compete being better, more stable, upward trajectory, less volatile. Applied is in the best position we've ever been in to enable all of these great big inflections to happen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore","I wanted to ask about your sort of multiyear commentary when you said you are still optimistic even beyond 2017. Can you talk about NAND in that context and either still very high capital intensity period of planer to 3D conversions and 3D greenfield, you'll get to the point where you are going sort of more layer account increases which is less capital intensive. Shouldn't NAND turn into a headwind and at some point in the next couple of years? And how do you think about that in that multiyear context overall WFE?","Bob Halliday","Sure. Joe. Let me -- this is going to be historic day, I'm going to use phraseology on this in the next minute, it's never been used by a CFO and American Public Company before. All right so hold on. So I have a couple of slides in front of me that shows the demand for solid state disk drive market growth in both enterprise and PCs. So these numbers you can argue them a little bit but I think they are in the ballpark. So, 2015 there was about 12 petabytes of demand for solid state disk drives in enterprise. That goes up to almost a 120,000 petabytes in 2020, so it goes from 12,000 to 120,000, okay. And on the PC side in 2015 it's about 20,000 going to 140,000 petabytes in 2020. Let me give you another way to look at those. Our estimates that the penetration across all PCs including workstation, no parks in 2015 was 21.8% and was only 15% 2014, up to 31.6% of those have solid state disk drives going to 77.5% in 2020.","And if you go and look at the enterprise servers, this year it's about 20%, it was 14% of all in 2014 which is going to 26% in 2020. So, again the total petabytes, I'll use that word again, is going up over 100,000 petabytes from 2016 to 2020 in each PCs and enterprise. So the demand is there, they are expanding the addressable market for NAND. So other data I have seen is that for servers alone you might have to have 500,000 wafer starts of capacity and your average NAND effective 100,000 of cost about $5 billion or $6 billion, so that's about $25 billion to $30 billion, and upgrades are about another $25 billion to $30 billion. So, you could have $50 billion to $60 billion of spending and that's across caliber right now over the next sort of five years maybe, 2020 type data four or five years. So if you take it over four years, that's like you're going to be 50 billion net sales.","So it's over 10 billion a year, so we've upped this year's forecast, next year we're over I think 11 in change. And I'm not sure it doesn't stay at 10 billion and more for a few years to come because we kind of look at the end user demand for solid state disk drives penetrating hard disk drives by market. We're looking at capital intensity and we're getting feedback from customers. And in the short term, this shipping every day can build. So what's the point, I think the NAND build out on for while and I think people underestimating it because the other thing is they're going to convert to 2D to 3D because they're not going to sell the 2D, and that'll drive down to sell even more 3D and hit cost points at even with the hard disk drives even faster. So I think there's a bunch evasion to get a number that could be 10 billion for a while.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks Joe.","Bob Halliday","And I'd like to say that I was proud to use the word petabytes today.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel Nicolaus.","Patrick Ho","Bob maybe if you can just clarify again the growth that you're expecting in total display spending in 2017, is that incrementally because of the gen 10.5 build out that you're seeing or are you also anticipating a further increase in OLED spending next year?","Bob Halliday","I think we're seeing a few things, in actual spending, I think probably we're up -- we've slide on that. I think we're up probably more in TVs versus what we thought two months ago. We think that there's huge demand for OLED for mobile, the question is how much -- how fast can they ramp it? I mean I think its question of supply more than demand. I think TV, they can ramp the big TVs and they're going to ramp up pretty aggressively particularly in China, this gen 10.5 is ramping is going to be more to come after that.","So we're up to over 16.5 next year for display CapEx. I don't have the numbers from two months ago but to grow is in both. But I think the thing is bigger in two months for us is the TV because the TV sizes are coming bigger than we thought, the individual TV sizes; and the profitability is quite strong in the TV panel business, which is a leading indicator of spending, and then these big fabs. So I think they both are very healthy, but I think the increase is based probably more on the TV side.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham.","Edwin Mok","My question is on the DRAM side, Bob you sound a little more conservative on DRAM, but we're seeing here pricing improved and some talk about customer looking into moving to next node. Are you just being conservative or have you -- what are you doing for the customer and how you seeing signs that give you start moving onto your next node?","Bob Halliday","We can do DRAMs up next year, but we think most customers who make DRAM and NAND are setting a priority on NAND right now because they're seeing an expansion in their addressable market for NAND, number one. And number two; it's a competitive situation that they don't want to miss that growing market. In DRAM, their pricing is pretty good, so I think the capital goals will go to NAND.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jerome Ramel from BNP Paribas.","Jerome Ramel","I'd like to know what is your assumption in terms of in-store capacity with softer nodes for 10 nanometer for next year?","Gary Dickerson","Our line was quite for a moment. It sounded like you were talking about 10 nanometers and with the capacity at the end of the year or something, so we can quite sure.","Q - Jerome Ramel","Yes.","Gary Dickerson","Can you please just repeat thank you.","Jerome Ramel","Yes, can you share with us what is your assumption for the 10 nanometer node capacity that you have at the end of let's say Q4 2017 for the industry?","Bob Halliday","Sure, the chart look I am looking at, we put -- I'll give you what I have easily available, okay. The spending in '16 in foundry 59% is we think estimating '16 is for 10\/7, and about the same percentage next year because you are still seeing strength at some of the trailing edge stuff 28, and particularly 28 nano is pretty strong still in fact we think it might be up next year. And then in terms of the split between 10 and 7, the total capacity between 10 and 7 is around 70,000 to 80,000 wafer starts again at this year. But 110 to 130 to the next year, I think the vast majority that's 10 nanometer.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna.","Mehdi Hosseini","You sound really positive regarding the demand drivers and you are going to stop providing booking numbers on a quarterly basis, if you\u2019ll are so confident why not provide an annual revenue and earnings target, so there we can better track this multiyear cycle that you are going through?","Bob Halliday","We never have it in the industry and I am not going to start now. I mean, we don\u2019t give guidance out of year.","Mehdi Hosseini","But you stop providing booking so?","Bob Halliday","Here is all we gave you. We gave you a 2019 model. They gave you the WFE assumption, revenue assumption by product, share assumptions. We told you in the Analyst Day that our share gains were almost linear from now to 2019. And we told you that our service business was going to roll almost lineally by year. And we told you that display was going to be going up to that number too. So our growth in revenue from '15\/'16 and 19, we think is pretty straight-lined. Now, giving an absolute numbers a year in advance, we don\u2019t have that level precision.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from DA Davidson.","Tom Diffely","When you look to the next few years and all the growth coming from both the flat panel OLED as well as China. What impact does that have on your both cost structure and your market structure?","Bob Halliday","I am sorry, Tom, could you repeat it please?","Tom Diffely","Yes, when you look at growth coming specifically from the couple of large markets like OLED and China. What impact does ramping revenue on those particular markets due to your cost structured margin structure overtime?","Bob Halliday","I'll give a shot. In terms of -- okay, if you want to look at cost structures APPLIED, most of our sales are related to physical products resale and they share common factories, which are predominantly in Singapore and U.S. The material cost, product cost is similar and then Taiwan is a big source for our displays. So material cost structures and supply chains are worldwide, so where we sell them doesn\u2019t matter too much for us. In terms of differentiation and mix which sometimes drive gross margin, different device type customers use different mix of our hardware and products.","In terms of OLED, we look at the OLED display market for our existing products as being similar margin profiles to our TV markets and by regions summer. The opportunity for us in margin is the new products, we're going to be introducing in next couple of years in display, which we think of very highly differentiated and very attractive product which have upside for us. In terms of margins by region, it goes predominantly to mix of products. But historically, we provide a high level of service to customers in China and so we usually do well in terms of share there in particular.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, the incremental operating profit, if we look at China is pretty good for us. We have a very strong position nearly great relationships and then really great teams supporting customers both multinationals and the domestic companies and also the incremental profit for us in display is positive for the company overall.","Michael Sullivan","And then operator, I think we have time for just one more question please.","Operator","Certainly, our final question for today comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone.","Jagadish Iyer","Bob, I'm just trying to reconcile on the flash segment. We had a good spending this year, but why we're your orders essentially flat between fiscal 2015 fiscal 2016. I understand its fiscal year, but what does it mean for 2017. I mean fiscal 2017 given the spending that you are seeing for the flash? Thanks.","Bob Halliday","We had one particular customer in 2015 that gave us orders pretty far and advance because they want to lock in capacity deliveries from us. So, I think that was the aberration. I think the trend line is up, if you look at total WFE, it's up for just flash; and if you look at our sales are up and probably they are up next year too. So we're little bit in 2015 one particular customer and particular want to get in to their pipeline in terms of the queue for production.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks Jagdish for your question and Bob would like to summarize before we close the call.","Bob Halliday","Sure, it seems like a year ago but we only had Analyst Day about six weeks ago here little more in the New York, and I have to say even in the last eight to nine weeks, I increasingly believe that the industry we serve are becoming more and more attractive than growing, and more diverse and less volatile. Gary talked about some of the demand drivers for our customers whether it's autonomous cars, it's virtual reality, it's AI big data. You really feel that's been driving the Silicon Valley. You see it everywhere. We had some of the CEOs of these companies coming and talk to us and it's real, it's happening. Look at some of the highest performing stocks in the states this year, that's what driving them.","So one, the industries we serve and displays also that way were just kind of doubled in terms of spending and becoming more and more attractive and more demand drivers will predict the less volatile for us. Second Applied is performing better, I think we are more and more becoming more and more innovative and executing better in this compounding benefits from that. So, I think that's resulting in a broad range of opportunities. Our biggest promise is just picking and choosing among good opportunities at this point. So Applied is becoming more broader, more diverse and less volatile, and more predictably we're going to do better. Alright.","And then finally, those two things combined and potential with tax legislation that there is really good opportunity to return superior cash returns to investors including which we've said I think we said earlier today that we we're conservative in the financial moving a lot, and we showed eight weeks ago in terms of the cash and we kept a little conservatives within the cash and the model because we were wanted to be opportunistic, if the world tax slot changes that we could return even greater return to the investors.","So I think the industry is becoming more diverse and less volatile and more attract in terms of growth, more drivers. Applied is becoming that way and the leverage down to the cash line especially, if you get some tax legislation less attractive is pretty powerful combination for Applied.","Michael Sullivan","Great. Okay, thanks Bob. And we\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. So thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"2859":["Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) Q1 2015 Earnings Call February 11, 2015  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Michael Sullivan - Vice President of Investor Relations","Gary E.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you, Dustin. Today, we'll discuss the results for our first quarter, which ended on January 25. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements about Applied's performance, products, strategies, opportunities, announced business combination with Tokyo Electron and business and industry outlook. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied, and they should be interpreted in that light.","Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak as of February 11, 2015, and we assume no obligation to update them.","Today's call also includes non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary E. Dickerson","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Let me start by providing an assessment of our overall progress. First, our long-term strategy. We are driving profitable growth by enabling major technology inflections using our precision materials engineering leadership to gain share and grow faster than the markets we serve.","Major transitions in semiconductor and Display technology create great opportunities for Applied. We are making meaningful progress towards our long-term strategic goals, and this will be accelerated by our upcoming merger.","In the midterm, we have been focused on those opportunities that move the needle for customers and for Applied. We have strengthened our R&D and field teams, while increasing investment in product development. We've also created a pipeline of new, differentiated products that accelerate Applied's growth when customers move to new technology -- when customers move new technology into high-volume production. And we're managing the effect on margins as we ramp these new products.","In the short term, the forecasted levels of invested by our -- investment by our customers provide a solid foundation for the year ahead. While there are challenges inherent in our spending mix and some uncertainties about timing, we remain firmly on our trajectory of profitable growth.","At the same time, we are completing our preparations to merge with Tokyo Electron. The Applied and Tokyo Electron teams are very excited about the strategic opportunity this merger creates and share a strong commitment to work together to achieve our performance goals for the new company.","We believe we are making progress with regulators around the world on a coordinated proposal that would allow us to move forward with our business combination. We are working to secure the remaining approvals and complete the merger as soon as possible.","During this phase, we've been advised not to provide details or answer questions about ongoing discussions.","Turning to our market outlook. Industry growth is fueled by evolving trends in mobility, connectivity, video and wearable devices. This is accelerating innovations in mobile processors, solid-state storage and interactive displays.","Our customers are focused on winning share in these inflection and this is resulting in a period of sustained investment by semiconductor customers. We believe wafer fab equipment spending for calendar 2014 was approximately 15% higher than the previous year. And as we look ahead, we maintain our view that the market could grow another 5% or more in 2015.","In foundry, we expect investment to be maintained at the same healthy levels seen in 2014, with the potential to be slightly higher than last year. Our current view is that spending for advanced nodes will be heavily biased towards the second half of the year.","While we see some timing uncertainty with the ramp of this complex technology, the FinFET inflection is highly beneficial for Applied, expanding the opportunity for our leadership products in FE, metal deposition, implants, anneals and CMP.","In memory, supply remains tight with a healthy pricing environment and robust investment. In the past quarter, we booked our highest orders from memory customers in over 7 years. This includes our highest quarterly DRAM orders since 2010.","DRAM bit growth for 2015 is expected to be around 30% with mobile DRAM standing out as the most significant driver. While technology conversions are currently providing a large portion of the needed supply, increasing device complexity and additional process steps required at the smaller nodes are reducing effective factory output.","In addition, mobile DRAM devices are typically larger than PC DRAM and the combination of these factors is leading to new capacity additions this year.","The market for NAND memory is also expanding. Leading smartphone makers have doubled the average bits per box over the past 12 months and this, added to growth in solid-state drives is supporting NAND bit growth in the range of 40%. Although we believe the majority of NAND investments will still be focused on advanced planar capacity, we see 3D NAND spending for the year at approximately twice the 2014 level, with more customers starting to move to this technology.","The industry's transition to 3D NAND has been slower than forecast, however, it remains a positive inflection for Applied, expanding our served available market by 35% to 50%.","The outlook for Display also remains very healthy. Average TV sizes are growing faster than historic rates, and we are seeing a surge in unit sales, fueled by consumer spending on new 4K and OLED models. Demand for bigger, higher resolution, low-power screens for mobile applications is also a key factor behind Display growth.","In TV and mobile, supply is tight, and our customers are investing in new capacity and advanced technology. This quarter, our Display business delivered its highest revenue in the past 3 years.","As we have said before, major inflections like FinFET, 3D NAND and new displays represent unprecedented technology advances that are enabled by materials innovation.","We are still in the early stages of these inflections and as they play out over the next several years, they create great, long-term growth opportunities for Applied.","To fully capitalize on these transitions, we have aligned our structure and talent around key areas of value creation. We will continue to aggressively manage our product portfolio so we can quickly shift resources to areas that are truly enabling for customers and generate the best returns for us.","We are starting to see the impact of these changes. In 2013, we won 1.4 points of share in wafer fab equipment while delivering innovative and enabling new products to customers.","In 2014, we consolidated our new product positions and strengthened our product pipeline. We believe we gained share or held share in almost all our businesses. And based on our current view of customer spending, we expect to grow our overall wafer fab equipment share again in 2015.","We are making our largest gains in areas where the market is growing rapidly, including CVD and Etch. This past calendar year, we estimate that we won at least 3 points of share in CVD and 5 points of share in conductor etch. Etch is a business where we continue to build momentum. We have been focusing on key technology inflections in market segments, where we believe we have sustainable technology differentiation.","New wins in memory combined with our traction in foundry, helped us deliver our highest Etch quarterly revenues in orders since 2007. Our latest generation Etch system has one of the fastest adoption rates of any new Applied product in recent years. We shipped 3x as many chambers in the first quarter than we did in the prior quarter, and we expect to double shipment volumes again in Q2.","We also see great opportunities to grow our service business. We are bringing together capabilities from across the company to develop expanded service offerings that help customers ramp complex new device technologies faster and at lower cost.","At both leading and trailing nodes, wafer starts and fab utilization are at very high levels. We are winning new service contracts from a broad base of customers and growing faster than the market.","Over the past 2 quarters, our service business booked its highest orders for any 6-month period in our history.","In summary, while there are risks related to the timing of customer investments, our current view is that 2015 will be a solid market growth -- a year of solid market growth, driven by robust memory spending in the first half and foundries ramping FinFET production in the second half.","Applied Materials has a strong platform to gain share, driven by tremendous customer pull for enabling precision materials, engineering products and services. And across the organization, we remain highly focused on improving execution. We are driving alignment, speed and scale as we prepare to merge with Tokyo Electron and hit the ground running as we become one company.","Let me now hand the call over to Bob, who will provide further details on our performance and outlook.","Robert J. Halliday","Thanks, Gary. Gary gave us an update on the market environment and the status of technology inflections. I'll begin by translating how we expect those patterns to play out in our business during the current fiscal year.","First, you'll notice that memory spending is particularly strong in the first half of our year. In Q1, our memory orders top foundry and logic orders for the first time in 5 years, and we could see a similar mix in Q2.","Next, you will notice that while our foundry customers are intensely focused on ramping FinFETs, the order pattern is shaping up to the back half loaded, also for the first time in years. We expect this mix to put more revenue and margin in our fiscal second half.","Gary indicated the calendar 2015 WFE could be up by 5% or more. The greatest swing factor in our model is how much of the expected foundry spending is captured by the end of our fiscal year in October.","From where we sit today, we expect a very strong fiscal second half. The high mix of memory in Etch resulted in gross margins being below our expectations for the quarter. Specifically, Etch grew 90% sequentially, higher than our previous goal of 60%.","Gary spoke about our focus on portfolio management. Like we discussed, some of the results we're seeing in our efforts to generate profitable growth across our businesses. In AGS, we've strengthened the linkages to SSG and operations, invested in higher-value offerings and focused on delivering long-term service contracts that could help customers with uptime, yields and cost.","After 2 years of declining sales, AGS posted 9% growth in fiscal 2014. AGS delivered near-record orders in Q1 and is on track for continued revenue growth and margin expansion.","Our Display business was the first one to fully deploy our product development engine best practices and received internal funding to capture share in CVD, PVD and new products based on large area precision materials engineering.","In Q1, the Display group posted a second sequential quarter with operating margins above 25%. Display also had strong momentum, with new Gen 6 PVD products for advanced mobile displays and new CVD encapsulation systems for OLEDs.","In FSG, the increased investments we made beginning in the second half of 2012 are starting to pay off by giving us memory share gains during a period of renewed memory investment.","In calendar 2014, memory spending drove the growth of the Etch and CVD markets at a higher rate than overall WFE. We believe Applied's Etch and CVD businesses grew more than 50% combined in calendar 2014, which is 1.5x the rate of the Etch and CVD markets and over 2x the rate of our largest competitor in these areas.","Our latest Etch platform is generating traction in foundry, as well as memory. We have a task force in place to drive our Etch gross margins to higher levels as we mature our new chamber technology and increase our scale.","In foundry, our investment and advanced deposition techniques is enabling strong adoption of CVD cobalt for interconnects, and new Epi steps in emerging nodes.","In Logic, we have nearly doubled the number of D2R wins in the past 2 years, which is a good leading indicator of share gains in next-generation transistors. And finally, over the last 2 years, we have tripled our corporate technology groups funding of disruptive new products and markets for our longer-term growth.","In short, we are seeing strong early returns for our growth initiatives within FSG, Display and AGS that will allow us to grow revenues and profitability, particularly as our customers ramp new nodes into higher volumes.","Next, I'll summarize our first quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.3 billion were up 1% sequentially, with increases in FSG and EES, offsetting decreases in AGS and Display.","Although AGS orders were down from our Q4 record, they were the second highest ever and up 16% from Q1 of 2014. Net sales of $2.4 billion were near the high end of our expectations.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $552 million were near the low end of guidance. As a reminder, many of our groups had a holiday shutdown during the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 was at the midpoint of our guidance.","Operating cash flow of $60 million, reflecting high revenue from Display tools that were previously secured with cash in advance.","In Q1, we also had annual incentive compensation and withholding tax payments. Absent the timing of these items, operating cash flow remains strong.","Now I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. FSG orders of $1.4 billion were up 7%, with increases in memory, offsetting decreases in foundry and Logic. FSG net sales of $1.4 billion were slightly above the midpoint of our expectations.","FSG non-GAAP operating margin decreased slightly to 24.2%. AGS orders of $690 million were down 8% and remained at near-record levels. AGS net sales of $583 million were in line with our expectations and AGS non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1.7 points to 26.4%, reflecting favorable product mix.","Display orders declined to $107 million, and we expect the booking pattern to remain lumpy. Display net sales of $275 million were up 45% as customers began to ramp the new TV capacity booked over the last 6 to 9 months.","Display non-GAAP operating margin was 26.5%. EES orders grew slightly to $50 million and net sales of $55 million were below our expectations. EES both posted a small non-GAAP operating loss, and we continue to monitor the solar market closely.","Now I'll provide our second quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to up a couple of points sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect FSG net sales to be up by about 4% to 8%. AGS net sales should be up by about 5% to 10%. We expect Display net sales to be approximately $160 million, and EES net sales should be approximately $75 million. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately flat. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $570 million, plus or minus $10 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.30.","Now let me turn the call back over to Mike for questions.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you, Bob. [Operator Instructions] Dustin, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Bob, can you give us the specific SSG order breakout by memory, foundry? And then maybe within memory, can you give us DRAM and NAND?","Robert J. Halliday","Sure. Let me take it out. Yes, in Q1, foundry was a little under 500. Memory total was about 700, a little over, and Logic and other was about 200.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Bob, I just wanted to ask about margins. You talked about the second half being stronger. It sounds like fiscal second half revenue is going to be up versus fiscal first half, but the margins in the fiscal first half have been a little bit under pressure. Can you speak to why that's been the case? And will the margin pressure lift during the fiscal back half the year? Of course, this is on a standalone basis X the merger, obviously. But will that margin pressure lift during the fiscal back half of the year?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, it should. The biggest thing that's going on is mix for us within SSG. So SSG we're doing very well and gaining share in Etch, particularly in memory. So if you look at memory, I think over 50%, 52% of orders in the first couple of quarters are memory-related, which is a high point for us. And a lot of that drive is Etch and CVD. Etch, we're shipping new tools. Our C3 chamber is doing really well. So that's dragging margin a little bit and what we usually see as we see foundry picking up around a little stronger, a little sooner and the mix of tools there is a little better for us and the margins. So the mix is hurting us a little bit. We had some of this in the first -- early part of last year, but foundry picked up a little early last year. So it should go better in the second half but that's what's going on.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, Tim, one thing I'd say is that, I think, the good news is that we're getting great traction with some of our new products, including products in Etch and CVD, and some of the fastest ramp rates that we've ever seen for new products. But the start-up costs there are also higher and then over time, we can work those back down.","Operator","Our next question comes from that line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First, Gary or Bob, if I look at foundry spending over the last few years, it's always been front half loaded, which kind of makes sense given end consumer products release in the second half. What is different this time around that foundry is actually back half loaded?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes. Well, that's a question we talked a lot about, too. I'll tell you my opinion. Typically, it's first half loaded and last year, it was even a little earlier than previous years, in my opinion, because a leading foundry had the Apple business and they wanted to ramp very effectively. So things like our Epi tools, they took a little earlier even to make sure they're working well and they had a good ramp. This year, it's not clear how many -- when the cutover to FinFET devices are. So all the customers are saying they're going to ramp FinFET, spend a lot of money, but it looks like the ramp of that is a little later and part of that is also impacted by what is the relative rate of reuse of tools, too. So it was probably a little bit early last year and it seems a little bit later than the average this year.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, got it. All right. And then as a follow-up, on the conductor etch side, you guys mentioned significant wins last year. I'm kind of curious, when you quantify wins, is it by revenue shift or is it by units share? And also, which specific segments? Was it more on the DRAM NAND side or was it more on the foundry side?","Robert J. Halliday","It was revenue dollars as measured by Dataquest, and it will be in memory. We did pretty well in DRAM and NAND. And we're pretty optimistic we'll do well again in calendar '15.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, we also have traction in foundry. But as Bob said, the majority of the share gains right now were in memory. If you look over the last couple of years, in Etch and conductor etch, we talked about 5 points of conductor etch share gain this year. We had 6 points of share gain last year in 2013. So we have really significant momentum. Certainly, memory is where we see the largest revenue now, but we also have traction outside of memory that provides an opportunity for growth going forward. And the other thing as we talked about, the Etch and CVD revenues combined increase greater than 50% in 2014. So if you look at the growth rates of those markets, in both of those areas, we're significantly outgrowing the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I appreciate your comments on the transaction. Having said that, a lot of people are sort of stumped as to why the transaction is taking so long. And I realize that you guys are limited in what you can say. But I'm kind of hopeful that you can provide us some additional color. And I guess just what gives you confidence that this process isn't going to continue to drag on beyond the first half the year? That's my first question.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, I think the reason it's complicated is because we have a very complicated business. If you look between us and Tokyo Electron, many, many different segments, many different products. And so I think that's a higher degree of complexity than you normally see in this type of situation. What we said earlier was that we're making progress with regulators. And we're going to close the merger as soon as we can. We really can't talk any -- say anything more at this point beyond that.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess my other comment is just on mix. You mentioned that memory is really strong here in the first half. Are you guys -- I guess how should we think about memory in the second half? Is there concern that we may see a sharp fall off and maybe offset some of the growth that you're expecting in foundry?","Robert J. Halliday","Well, we all have our opinions. I think you have to look at the fiscal halves and the calendar halves. As you know, our fiscal half is -- we end our fiscal year in October 31. My belief is that the second half foundry is stronger than typical, as I said, before. We think memory is stronger in the first half although I think there's a little upside to the memory outlook quite frankly. So I don't think memory is going to follow off if you look at pricing. I'll give you another data point. Utilization across all the fabs is running pretty darn high right now. So that I think that the forecast is pretty good, just timing and mix issues really.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My first question is regarding the foundry investment this year. I just wanted to make sure I understand the linearity of it a little bit better. You mentioned that's stronger in the second half. Just given the timing of the end consumer devices and the ramp associated with it, is it fair to think like the strength would be more stronger in the July quarter than the October quarter?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, I'll try and take that one. Right now, we think that the July and October quarters are pretty strong. We think right now that -- they're pretty close actually. I'm looking at the data. July might be a little stronger than October, but they're pretty close.","Gary E. Dickerson","One other thing I would say on the foundry business is that this is a huge competitive battle for our customers. So I would expect there's going to be more technology buys also than we would normally see. There's certainly the race to the first generation FinFET but there's also, in parallel, a tremendous pull from customers as they drive to second generation FinFET from a technology perspective. So that's another thing that we see very strong pull from customers that could play out. And we're talking about second half of our fiscal year. So it could play out a little bit more in the second half of our fiscal year.","Farhan Ahmad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then one question on the market share. You mentioned that AMAT gained share in WFE this year. But when I look at your revenues, they're up 12% year-on-year like just for the calendar year and I'm kind of using the Jan ending revenues for the last 12 months. They're up 12% year-on-year and you mentioned that WFE was up 15%. So I just wanted to understand like if WFE is up 15% and your revenues are up 12% then how are you gaining share?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, let me see if I can help that one. I think on the -- so we gained share in '13 and that's in the Dataquest, I think about 1.4, whatever it was. On WFE, I think we held share in calendar '14 on WFE. I don't think we gained. I think we gained or held share at every single product group in which we competed, but some of our large share product groups didn't outgrow the WFE. So on WFE, I think we're flat. Across all other product groups, we gained or held except one we lost.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, let me just -- on the last question, one final point. We also had a strong November, December. So that will help you understand it, too.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Bob, if I look at your outlook for SSG, up 48%. Is that in line with your peers given your mix is a little bit more foundry-centric, but the nonsemi markets are, like you said, a bit lumpy. So can you provide a bit more color on what what's happening in the Display market near term in its seasonality? And then on the EES, is that being impacted by oil prices being lower? And then I have a follow-up.","Robert J. Halliday","So the first question was the foundry spending mix, is this what you're asking, Atif?","Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, what's going on with the nonsemi markets and Display and EES? Can you give a little bit more color?","Robert J. Halliday","Sure. Nonesemi, I'll do solar first. On solar, we're managing that pretty darn well and the market, the end-used market for solar panels and solar cells is pretty good. But there still is an overhang of excess capacity out there that's being eaten up. So it's sort of a neutral market, it's treading water. And so it's just quarter-to-quarter variations on small numbers. In the Display market, our position has been very strong in Display. We've gained share, we've come up with new products, execution has been a very good and that market is made up of 2 primary customer types, Display equipment we sell for TVs and Display equipment we sell for smaller form factors like iPhone -- cell phones and pads, iPad-type things. So if you look at it, this year looks like bookings will be a little bit more swinging towards the smaller form factors. And so what we're doing is the build out of TVs which are helping revenues. So we've got really big bookings last year if you remember that was shipping those. This year, we think the bookings on TVs will be a little less, but the bigger -- the smaller form factors will be greater. So that's the transition that's going on there.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then you had $63 million in adjustments in your backlog on FX. Can you talk about the headwinds from here on FX in your exposure?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, that's a good question, too. So as you know, that yen is down significantly and euro softened up. So no. The yen is the bigger impact for us. Now as a practical matter, the way we sell, most of our costs are in dollar-denominated and our revenues are fundamentally dollar-denominated. Now when we priced in Japan, we are somewhat competitive to Japanese competitors, but we largely price in dollars and translate that into yen and largely hedge the impact. So we can somewhat differ the impact. So I'd say that the yen to Applied alone is not a big impact. It's a little bit more impactful to Tokyo Electron who bills in yen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know you talked about a stronger second half driven by foundry and continued memory and within that, a strong July quarter. So just to clarify, you guys are seeing foundry and memory being strong contributors in July? And if foundry is indeed starting to become stronger in July, is it more than just one customer? Is a little bit more broad-based than that?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, we see that the foundry is picking up in the second half. So the mix of spending by half. Foundry is more heavily weighted to our -- to the calendar second half and our fiscal second half. Memory is more weighted to the calendar first half and to our fiscal first half. So that's the mix. If you ask me, I think there's a little bit of upside to what we think on memory in the second half, particularly DRAM. In terms of absolute dollars, I think because the mix is heavier on memory in the first half, the dollar is probably a little bigger in the first half. And then the other wildcard is 3D NAND could be an opportunity later in the year.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then you typically have a step-up in OpEx in Q2, as you just guided to. How should we expect that to trend in Q3 and Q4, especially as the team continues to invest heavily on growth opportunities?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes. Last quarter, I talked about our spending is up a little bit this year. I thought we might even get up closer to $570 million, $575 million. We're trying to manage that tightly. We had the benefit of a shutdown this quarter. We guided to $570 million, plus or minus, $10 million in Q2. Q3 I think and Q4 were sort of in the same range, up a few million, in the $570 million is my guess.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of questions and this is probably beating a dead horse. But just on the foundry demand, I'm really just trying to reconcile what I heard from TSMC which is that they raised CapEx by around 24% and Samsung, which said that foundry CapEx would be up year-over-year. With your view that foundry spending should be kind of flat or maybe up in 2015, is there a way to reconcile that? Are you hearing -- you're seeing a good visibility into this but are you hearing maybe something a little different than maybe what the companies are indicating? And then I have a follow-up.","Robert J. Halliday","I think global foundry is probably down year-on-year is my guess, and UMC is up a little bit or flat. And then the other issue -- so I think the other thing is that calendar fiscal we sort of are a little bit conservative just because our fiscal year ends in October. So it could be slipping to November, December, too, which makes us a little worried. But overall, we're seeing it's up a little bit overall, foundry.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And then just on the other side, back to the currency question. It seems like you should get maybe a little bit of gross margin uplift from some of your foreign production. But yet, you're modeling gross margin kind of flattish. And I am wondering why you're not getting a little bit of uplift maybe from the foreign exchange or currency discrepancy?","Robert J. Halliday","Oh, in terms of our...","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Or manufacturing and selling in dollars?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, we don't do heavy manufacturing overseas. Most of what our product costs is materials. The majority -- vast majority of our material cost is dollar-denominated. So we haven't got a lot of benefit there. We're trying to get some more benefit but the vast majority of our product costs is dollars.","Operator","Our next question comes from that line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Gary, maybe just, first, from an industry perspective. Given some of the uncertainty and the timing of this foundry FinFET ramp. Do you believe it's weighted more towards the uncertainty in terms of the customer allocation of the capacity to the foundries or the yield challenges that the industry is facing right now?","Gary E. Dickerson","Well, Patrick, that's a very good question. Certainly, this is the -- a major competitive battle for our customers and everybody is focused on -- as I said before, not just first generation but also second generation FinFET. So for us, when we -- I think one of the other callers, maybe it was Wes, I talked about announcements from customers, TSMC and Samsung being pretty bullish on CapEx. I think for us, the uncertainty, as you said, is around allocation. Where are those dollars going to go? They're going to go to one of those different companies and so there's still some uncertainty around that. I think that for all of these companies, this is a huge bet. This is the biggest change in terms of the transistor technology that we've seen in a very, very long time. So all of these companies are extremely focused. They're investing a lot also in technology so they can shorten their cycle between first generation and second generation and all of that is very good to us because, as we've said before, our total available market increases a significant amount and we're very leveraged around the transistor. Our businesses like Epi and PVD are extremely strong, implants, a number of different areas. So for us, we're in a very good position no matter who that business goes to because the TAM for us is so much larger. But when we talk about the uncertainty, it's really what I just discussed.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. Maybe for Bob. Just kind of following up on some of the uncertainty with the foundry ramp. How are you managing the supply chain as well as the inventory given the uncertainties out there? How are you going to -- I guess, with the pulls and pushes on the levers on that front?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, that's a good question, Patrick. We actually think our demand on the supply chain is going to be pretty high for 2 reasons. One, our sales of spare parts are pretty strong, as you can see in our AGS business, and with fab utilization running pretty high. We think the spare parts that we ship a lot of will be pretty high, so we'll buy those from suppliers. And the second thing is if we get this steep way up in this second half, we'll get a lot of pull. So overall, demand on suppliers is going to be pretty high. Some of those tools and inventory we have brought in now to mitigate the risk of the ramp, so you see our inventory is up a little bit. And then the third thing we're going to take a look at is we're spending a lot of time handholding, working closely with suppliers to make sure that ramp goes okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC.","Shawn Yuan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Shawn Yuan for Mahesh. First, you mentioned WFE up 5% or more this year. This is relatively lower than some of the peers are commenting and it's certainly lower than -- I think people are thinking about 5% to 10% -- up 5% to 10% range. So are you guys seeing anything differently from your peers? And then do you think in the long-term model, you guys are thinking about 30 17 [ph] in WFE [indiscernible] 17. And do you think in this year or next, we may see maybe 1 or 2 quarter WFE run rate when they reach that level?","Robert J. Halliday","No, I think we're pretty close on the WFE. We're sort of around the $34 billion number. I think everybody else is pretty close to that.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, I think what we said was 5% or more. I think LAM was 0% to 13%, if I remember correctly. So we're really in the same range.","Shawn Yuan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then another comment you made in the prepared remark is that 3D NAND spending will be about twice of 2014 level. And some of your customers in their earnings indicate that they're planning to reuse some tools for 3D NAND development. I'm just wondering, can you talk about your assumptions on your 3D NAND spending for 2015?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, that's a good question. So 3D NAND is really, for us, really major opportunity from a growth perspective. It is very focused on Etch and deposition and not so much on litho. So the feature sizes are actually increasing as they go from planar to 3D NAND, but there is a lot of spending on Etch and deposition systems. And the process is very different than the planar NAND. So it is true that there's reuse but for us, in our business, there's a huge opportunity for TAM growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","So just a longer-term question here. Curious what you think the current spending patterns are in China? And if you expect them to go up materially over the next couple for years. And then what your percentage of that market is on a relative basis.","Gary E. Dickerson","So we -- thanks for the question. We don't really see a significant change in the CapEx spending in China. Actually, our position there is very, very strong. The leading foundry in China, we have a great relationship, our share there is very high. In general, foundry is an area where we have high share at all customers. But in China, we have a very, very good position, very good relationship. So if that spending would ramp, that would be a good thing for us. But we really don't see a big change there in the next year or 2.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe switching gears to the Display business. If the manufacturers were to switch to OLED TVs, does that materially impact the equipment market size?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, OLED is -- basically, if you look at the number of deposition steps and the number of steps that we participate in, if you compare amorphous silicon to OLED, it's about 2x the total available market opportunity for us. So certainly, OLED ramping would be very good for our Display business. Overall -- there was a question earlier on Display. That group has really done an incredible job. They are gaining share in the market. And when we look at our model for the company, Display really is pretty much on model versus what we had discussed a couple of years ago. Growing share, really focused on how we help customers make these technology transitions from amorphous silicon to LTPS, metal oxide. And OLED really is the best opportunity for us when that technology ramps.","Operator","Our next question comes from that line of Edwin Mok with Needham.","Yeuk-Fai Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So just quickly follow up on gross margin. I think you guys guided for flattish this quarter. And I noticed you have some pretty strong DRAM order, I mean, DRAM is very concentrated in the space. Now does those big orders have any effect on gross margin for this quarter? And also, does the timing of the Chinese New Year maybe have an effect on timing of the shipments, which impact gross margin?","Robert J. Halliday","Sure. The biggest single swing for us within the SSG business is what tool types we ship. So Etch is -- we're gaining share and Etch, particularly in memory, we're getting more D2R positions, making progress in foundry and places like that. We get a lot of sales in Etch, high aspect ratio Etch and also all types of Etch steps and depositions steps seen in NAND and DRAM. So it's that tool mix that's different for us in memory versus foundry. Foundry, we tend to be very high shares, strong positions in tools like Epi, PVD, implants, things like that. But it's the tool mix between the 2 that's the biggest driver.","Yeuk-Fai Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then on your commentary about Etch plus CVD growing by 50% just last year, right? And I think someone asked you about what happened to your other business and you mentioned that you held share with some of the market may have shrinked a little bit. I'm trying to dive in a little bit into that. Is it just because its type of spending that caused that, some of those other product market -- or product market has shrunk? Or is that something else going on or is it just customer investing in other areas? Can you give us some color on that?","Robert J. Halliday","Sure. We held overall WFE share. We gain an Etch CVD. We lost some in wafer defect and inspection. Frankly, that will come out in a month or 2. So we'll share that with you. Some of the others we held shared or gained share but the TAMs didn't grow as fast as Etch and CVD. So we're getting share in Etch and CVD, holding very high share in some other strong markets. But a couple of the other markets, like implant didn't grow quite as fast as some of the other markets. So it's a mix within the businesses as much as anything.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes. One of the things relative to the overall market, the overall wafer inspection business actually grew less than we had thought it would in 2014 and slower than the overall market growth. So that was a negative. Optical wafer inspection, as Bob said, we lost some share due to the customer mix in 2014. E-beam, where we have technology leadership, we actually gained share in e-beam review, about 15 points of share, we think, in e-beam review. We gained share in CD metrology and we think that e-beam inspection is also an opportunity for us. So in '15, what we think is that the mix will be more favorable for us and really, the area that is growing the fastest in e-beam technology, we have very, very strong position with some new products and we look at that as a growth opportunity for us in 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from that line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You and your competitors in the past have talked about, I guess, over the next few years FinFET and 3D NAND are the bigger incremental opportunities than more like in DRAM and advanced packaging. Yet, most of the upside in recent quarters have been coming from DRAM. So do you think this is just a timing issue because FinFET and 3D NAND is being pushed out? Or do you think the capital intensity for DRAM is higher than you previously thought?","Gary E. Dickerson","Well, I think DRAM is certainly up and we talked about what the drivers are for the DRAM business. But the timing for 3D NAND is later than what some people had expected. I think everyone is seeing very strong pull for 3D NAND. There's compelling pull from customers around the performance of the 3D NAND technology. And when you look at bit scaling over the longer term, that is the direction for every single one of our customers. There's a huge focus there and we -- although it's later than what we had expected, we start -- we see the second half of this year switch over in 3D NAND being more significant. And FinFET is also a great opportunity. It is the #1 competitive battleground for all of the foundry customers. And we certainly see that all of the customers will move to that technology. And we look at that being more heavily weighted toward the second half of this year and into 2016.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then my follow-up question is, given the slower ramp of FinFET, how would you characterize the industry investment and capacity of 28-nanometers and 20-nanometers relative to what you think, let's say, 6 months ago?","Robert J. Halliday","Well, we think this year is heavily weighted towards FinFET versus 28. In terms of 20, some of the tools sets are the same for 20 and FinFET. So it's a little hard to make a clear delineation of that, but we think it's more mostly FinFET, 16- to 14-nanometer ramping, but some of the tools you could use between 20 and 16 or 14. So I think it's just heavily weighted towards FinFET. The issue is I think it's a little later in the year than last year. Last year was a little early than normal. This year is a later than normal, I'd say.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, 28 was the majority of the spending. 28-nanometer is the majority of spending in 2014. If you look at 2015 spending, what we're projecting, it's by far very heavily weighted to 14- and 16-nanometer technology.","Operator","Our next question comes from that line of Srini Sundar [ph] with Summitt [indiscernible].","Unknown Analyst","My first question is what gives you any confidence that the merger will go through? And based on the prior approvals, what were the main points that you have to win to get the approval, assume that I have not gotten a memo that you cannot talk on the merger.","Gary E. Dickerson","Well, thanks for the question. The -- as we said before, we really can't give you any more color than what we had discussed before. What we have said is that we are making progress with regulators. We believe that this is the right strategy for our companies to come together. We think there are -- it's a great strategic opportunity. All of the people involved are very excited. But unfortunately, we really can't say anything more than that.","Unknown Analyst","Sure. No problem. Second thing is on the -- what are the basic differences between the first generation FinFET to second generation FinFET? And how would you guys be advantaged by going to the next generation FinFET?","Gary E. Dickerson","Well, the FinFET technology is really very heavily weighted, if you look at Epi for instance. The number of Epi steps continue to grow and that's just a tremendous opportunity for us. NDP steps also are -- that's a great TAM for us and FinFET. We're also seeing actually a next-generation FinFET technologies, more opportunities in areas like implant. The customers are very focused on trying to drive down the cost of multiple patterning but the number of steps are certainly increasing. We have some technologies we talked about, selective material removal being an area that we see very high growth. And that's another area that we believe is going to be a big focus for our customers certainly as they go to second generation FinFETs. So our strength is really around the transistor and that's what FinFET is all about and so that leverages many areas where we have technology leadership.","Operator","The last question comes from that line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG International.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Gary, I want to better understand your assumption for 3D NAND. When I talk to your customers, they all argue that when 3D NAND is still in commercialized, the CapEx for that is actually going to go down because the density per wafer is going to go up dramatically. So how can I reconcile your growth expectations with what your company -- with what your customers are saying? Especially when we think about CapEx per wafer compared to bits of NAND manufacturer per wafer? And I have a follow-up.","Gary E. Dickerson","Okay. Thanks for the question. As I said earlier, when you look at -- I think we've shown also in Investor Day and there's been at least 2 customers that have publicly talked about CapEx spending and the breakdown of CapEx spending for planar versus 3D NAND. The big change is that for the litho area, the CapEx spending is going to be lower. The Etch deposition and even Epi for us, we're seeing growth in 3D NAND. So the shift in the CapEx spending is going to be very significant in planar to 3D NAND. But the areas I just talked about are areas where we have very good position as customers are ramping these new technologies and we see very strong pull as they go to the first and second generation FinFET technologies.","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, I think related to that is -- it's the tool mix, it's more Etch and deposition versus litho. The second thing is because of that and you have a different tool set, the level of reuse is less. So if you look from a reuse model, which they've been pursuing pretty effectively to basically a pseudo-Greenfield model with a different device type, the tool mix is much more favorable for ourselves and other Etch and deposition companies.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got it. And then one follow-up. Based on the funding commission, it seems like the merger agreement is going to expire March 24. And given how FX is favoring Tokyo Electron, wouldn't they be more enticed to maybe change the details of the agreement because exchange rate is going to their favor?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, we really can't -- unfortunately, as I've talked about before, I think both companies strongly believe in the strategy. I think if anything, as we work together, we're more -- there's even a stronger belief that this combination will create value for customers and be just really a great opportunity. The working relationships are tremendous. And as I said before, we're making progress. We can't unfortunately, give any more color on the merger.","Michael Sullivan","Well, thanks, Mehdi, for your question. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon.

Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. As this is our fiscal year end call, I'd like to start by outlining the progress we are making towards our longer-term strategic and performance goals. I will then provide our market outlook and describe how this translates to opportunities and priorities for our business groups. Later in the call, Bob will give you additional color on our financial results and talk about how we are optimizing the company's performance and shareholder returns.","Applied Materials' strategy is built upon our leadership in materials engineering. Our foundational capabilities are the broadest and deepest in the industry. We have more tools in our toolbox to help our customers address their most critical technical challenges. Across the company, we are driving profitable growth by targeting major technology inflections and introducing new, differentiated, enabling products and services, for our customers. As a result, we are winning market share, growing our service business and expanding our available opportunities.","In fiscal 2015, we grew revenues 6% year-on-year and delivered our highest operating profits in four years. And while it's too early to talk about specifics for the calendar year, we are confident that we have made sustainable share gains in both wafer fab equipment and display.","Investments we have been making in R&D and field technical capabilities are yielding results. This year, we released breakthrough new product platforms to address rapidly growing opportunities in Etch, atomic layer deposition, and selective materials removal. At the same time, we have made the company more agile and efficient by optimizing the organization, business processes and product portfolios. These changes allow us to fuel our growth programs while maintaining our operating expenses at approximately the same run rate we had in 2012.","At the start of the year, industry forecasts expected 2015 wafer fab equipment to be up 5% to 10% year-on-year. Our latest estimate is that wafer fab equipment spending will be more or less flat relative to 2014. As the year progressed, the biggest change was foundry spending. We anticipate that calendar 2015 will represent the lowest spending levels by these customers in the past four years.","While Applied has our most favorable share positions at the foundries, we have introduced new products to strengthen our position in memory and continue to get stronger in this market. In the past two years, we've increased our share of total DRAM wafer fab equipment spending by about 5 points. We also expect to increase our share of total NAND spending by approximately 5 points in the transition from planar to second generation 3D NAND.","Overall, 2015 is a year of very strong memory investments with the highest level of spending by these customers in in seven years. As we look ahead, we expect DRAM bit demand to be in the 25% to 30% range, and investment levels in 2016 to be down significantly. In NAND, we believe next year's demand bit growth will be around 35% to 40%, and 2016 investments will be up year-on-year. We expect around 80% of spending to be focused on 3D NAND, as all the major memory customers ramp this technology into volume production.","In foundry, we anticipate investment levels will be slightly higher in 2016 with the bulk of spending in the second half of the year. We believe more than 50% of this spending will be focused on ramping 10-nanometer technology. In logic, we expect investment levels to be reasonably stable year-on-year. Overall, we currently see 2016 wafer fab equipment spending being approximately flat with some potential upside.","Having provided this backdrop, I will now outline the progress and priorities for each of our major businesses. In semiconductor equipment, we delivered our highest annual revenue in eight years, as major changes in device technology continue to expand our opportunities and provide a catalyst for market share gains. We have very strong momentum in our largest growth businesses, Etch and CVD, and still have significant room to grow.","In fiscal 2015, our Etch revenues exceeded $1.1 billion, an eight-year record, and we generated our highest CVD revenues in four years. Combined, our Etch and CVD revenues are up significantly year-on-year, and we continue to see very strong customer pull for our new products.","At the start of 2015, we targeted 25 new applications as part of our growth plan. By the end of our fourth quarter, we have won 49 new applications.","In our transistor and interconnect businesses, where we maintain strong leadership positions, we secured new applications wins at 10-nanometer that will enable us to increase our share of the available market as customers build out this node. At 10-nanometer, customers are making significant changes to interconnect technology to improve device performance and power consumption. We will be officially releasing new products to address advanced interconnect applications early in the New Year.","In addition, we are benefiting from new epi, thermal and implant steps and memory that expand our market. We also have a significant opportunity to grow in CMP, as the number of CMP steps doubles in the planar to 3D NAND inflection. This quarter we shipped the one hundredth unit of our latest generation CMP tool, the LK Prime. The success of this product helped our CMP group post its highest annual revenues since 2011.","In Process, Diagnostics, and Control, we recently released UVision 7, a new version of our brightfield inspection tool. This is another area where we see strong pull from customers and believe we're on track for share gains in brightfield this year. We have also been investing in a new E-Beam inspection platform, and this quarter, we posted our first revenue from both foundry and memory customers.","In service, 2015 revenues represent an all-time record for the company. Our team and AGS has done a remarkable job to place this business on a trajectory of profitable growth. Over the past two years, we have aligned our service strategy to enable our customer's success, while making significant enhancements to the organization, processes and operations that together, are enabling us to deliver and capture more value with our service products. We believe that our growth momentum in service is sustainable, and our fourth quarter orders represented another all-time record.","In display, 2015 was a third consecutive year of growth. As the display industry introduces new technologies for both TV and mobile applications, customers' manufacturing processes are becoming more complex and our market opportunity is expanding. As we look ahead to 2016 and beyond, one of the key battlegrounds will be for OLED leadership. As this inflection plays out, Applied is in a great position to benefit with new, enabling products, including our thin-film encapsulation system.","To summarize, in fiscal 2015, Applied Materials delivered solid growth and moved the ball forward towards our long-term strategic and financial goals. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees around the world for their tremendous contributions over the past 12 months. As we look ahead, we feel very good about our strategy, our customer positions, and our product pipeline. Across the company, we remain laser focused on delivering, delivering the enabling products our customers need to be successful, and delivering attractive returns for our shareholders. To achieve our goals, we are aggressively driving our growth programs, making the company more efficient and effective and carefully managing expenses.","Now, let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our results, performance and priorities. Bob?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Gary. And thank you all for joining us today. I will start by outlining the progress we made in 2015. We remain focused on investing in growth opportunities, increasing profitability, and delivering attractive cash returns to shareholders.","First, growth: For the year, our total orders grew by 5% to the highest level in 15 years when excluding solar. We grew our revenues by 6%. As compared to 2013, our revenues were up 29%. Our silicon systems orders and revenues were the highest since 2007. Revenues grew by 3% in 2015, building on a 25% gain in 2014. 2015 has been a very strong year for memory spending, and Applied made significant progress. Our strong position in 3D NAND gave us further growth in Etch and CVD. Combined, these businesses were up 23% for the year and have doubled since 2013. Gary mentioned that our Etch revenues exceeded $1.1 billion for the year, and they were up 140% versus 2013.","Our transistor and interconnect product lines maintained their leadership positions in 2015, and we expect the strength of these businesses to become more evident when foundry spending resumes later in our fiscal year. Applied Global Services revenues grew 15% in the year, with continued momentum in comprehensive service contracts as well as 200 millimeter equipment demand. And display revenues grew 27%, reflecting the success of new products such as thin-film encapsulation and PVD for mobile displays that are expanding our addressable market.","Next, profitability: On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin declined 1.2 points in 2015, or about 0.7 points when, excluding the non-run rate items that we reported in 2014. Operating margin remained at 19.6% for the year, as revenue growth and spending discipline offset the gross margin decline. We made further progress in our tax structure and achieved a full year tax rate of 19.3%, which was down by 13 points over the last five years. Earnings per share of $1.19 were our highest in four years, and the highest in eight years, when excluding solar.","Now cash returns: Total shareholder returns from buybacks and dividends for the year grew to $1.8 billion, which was nearly 200% of free cash flow. In Q3 and Q4, we deployed 44% of our three-year, $3 billion buyback authorization. We used $1.3 billion to repurchase 76 million shares, reducing our ending share count by 6% during the period. We also completed a $1.8 billion debt offering in September in an attractive interest rate environment. The offering was very well received and provides low cost capital to support increased financial flexibility for investments and capital returns. We also added $800 million of short-term debt to facilitate the efficient return of capital from one of our offshore entities. This debt is expected to be repaid within the current quarter.","Next, I'll make a few comments about the fourth quarter. Our overall results were at the midpoint of guidance. Revenues declined 5% sequentially, but grew 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin of 42.2% was modestly above our expectations, and operating expenses were $11 million below the midpoint of guidance. We used $700 million to repurchase 44 million shares of our stock at an average price of $15.78.","Turning to the segments; silicon systems orders were up 8% over year. Orders declined sequentially, following an all-time group record in Q3, and backlog remains strong at $1.7 billion. AGS orders of $761 million were up 2% year-over-year, and set another all-time quarterly record. Revenues were below the midpoint of our expectation, as 200 millimeter equipment sales were slightly lower than expected. Display orders were up 50% year-over-year, as expected. Display operating margins declined to 10%, reflecting a high mix of mobile products along with investments in new products that should significantly increase our addressable market and revenues. EES orders and revenues remained weak, and we continue to reduce our exposure to solar.","Now, let me talk about our priorities for the year ahead. As Gary discussed, we expect 2016 to be another year of healthy demand across silicon systems, services and display. In silicon systems, our early expectations are that demand should be higher in the second half of our fiscal year, particularly within foundry. Throughout the company, we are focused on making further progress toward our longer-term financial model.","On the revenue line, our outlook for overall demand, market share and served market expansion is positive. Gross margin improvement is a top priority for the company. We expect improvements in our second half, driven by three factors. First, we expect a more favorable mix, including higher foundry demand in silicon systems, and stronger TV demand in display. Second, we have line of sight to cost reductions for fast ramping new products. Third, we are making progress on our materials cost reduction.","For our operating expenses, we are performing better than our model. Our focus is to maintain spending discipline and to fund growth initiatives using identified savings and portfolio rationalization. For the tax rate, we expect to make incremental progress towards the model. And we will continue to be opportunistic with the stock buyback program to reduce the share count.","Now, I will provide the business outlook for our first quarter, which includes 14 weeks of operations. As compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect our overall sales to be down 2% to 9% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect silicon systems sales to be down 7% to 13%. AGS sales should be roughly flat. We expect display sales to be up 5% to 15% and EES sales should be approximately $50 million.","Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately flat. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million plus or minus $10 million. This includes two weeks of scheduled holiday shutdown, partially offset by the extra week in the quarter.","Given we recently raised debt, we expect our quarterly interest expense to increase to approximately $38 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.27.","In summary, Applied delivered another year of growth in orders, revenues and profitability. The investments we've made are resulting in share gains and a strong pipeline of new products aimed at key market inflections with strong customer pull. We are increasing our profitability and providing attractive cash returns to our shareholders.","Now, let me turn the call over to Mike for questions.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Kyle, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess, first question on the gross margin, it came in a little better I think, and guided flattish. Would love to hear your thoughts on what the magnitude would look, like in terms of the uplift as we head into more favorable mix, et cetera, in the back half of fiscal and calendar of 2016.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, I'd be happy to do it. Let me give you a little more color on the mix issue because we've talked about a lot. If you go look at the WFE mix for the last several years, for the three-year average from 2012 to 2014, foundry spending was about \u2013 almost 44% of the WFE mix. If you go look at DRAM, it was about 14.5% and NAND was about 17.7%. If you go look at this year, foundry was about 34.5%, DRAM was up to 25.1% and NAND was about 23.5%. We think foundry goes up as a percentage of the mix next year and NAND goes up.","Now, foundry is our highest percentage of WFE and NAND, which used to trail is approaching at the 3D inflection our share for foundry. So there's two stronger relative spending areas we see next year are foundry and especially NAND around V-NAND, where we say it's over 80% of the NAND spending next year. So if you trail it down, we see gross margin and revenue opportunities for us, share opportunities and gross margin improvement opportunities.","Now, we see those more in the second half because we think foundry is heavier in the second half, particularly around the 10-nanometer inflection. We think NAND is strong, but a little stronger in the second half. DRAM could go 50-50 split and logic could be pretty even. So if you look at the quarters in here, and I'm going to get to your specific question, C.J., but to give you context, I thought this would be helpful. We're assuming that our Q2 revenues and gross margins will be similar to Q1 with pickup in the second half. And in the second half, we see a booster for our revenues and our gross margins. And the gross margins, the opportunity for the company to improve are \u2013 we could go up quarter-on-quarter, half-on-half, we could go up \u2013 there's a lot of mix issues there, but the opportunity is a couple of points, half-on-half.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Very helpful. And I guess as a quick follow-up, you talked about NAND spending being up, led 80% by 3D, could you walk through what your expectations are for Greenfield versus upgrades in calendar 2016? Thank you.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So we see total V-NAND this year to be 150 ending this year. We see total ending next year to be about 350 to 400. That's a combination of adds and converts. Over 80% of the spend is on NAND. And then in terms total brand new adds, it depends on the customer converts. The total is going to get to 350, 400, we think, by the end of the year.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess first question is really a longer-term question about China as a new entrant into the memory industry. I mean, it's something we've seen over the years be so important to the semicap industry, whether it was Japan, Inc., or Korea, Inc., or Taiwan, Inc., and now it seems like China, Inc., is determined to become a player in the memory industry, in particular the DRAM industry, I guess, to start. So I guess, how big of an opportunity do you think it could be, how soon do you think it could impact your P&L? Obviously, I would think that the commentary you made about 2016 would include any early opportunities you see from China, but more really over the next couple of years.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, thanks for the question. Clearly, a lot of activity in China, as you've said, we have a very strong position in China. Applied just celebrated 30 years in China. We've got a great team and great capability there, very strong customer relationships and very strong share positions with Chinese companies and the multinational companies that are in China. There are a number of projects that people are talking about. There's certainly going to be some incremental wafer fab equipment spending in 2016. I don't know that we want to give a specific number right now. But I would say there are a lot of projects that are in the pipeline. And that could be from a strategic investment standpoint additive for wafer fab equipment. And our share there, Bob talked about our share in foundry. Our share in China is very, very, very strong. And again, 30 years we've built a very strong team there.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thanks. And I guess as a quick follow-up, if I could just ask, obviously there's some consolidation that's been announced in the industry. Would love your quick thoughts on whatever opportunities or threats you perceive as it relates to that consolidation. Thank you.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Again, thanks for the question. We like our strategy. As I've talked about on the call and also Bob's talked about, we have a very strong position in transistor and interconnect when foundry ramps, and Bob talked about that being in the second half of calendar 2016. We have strong customer pull for Etch, deposition and inspection. Very, very strong customer pull. We're growing the service business, significant opportunity to grow our display CAM, two, three X above where we're at right now, great alignment and pull from customers for our R&D pipeline. So, we're very focused on our opportunities. Bottom line, we're winning on selections, we have a good position to grow as our customers move to next generation technologies in semi and display.","Regarding Applied M&A, really nothing has changed relative to our strategy. We're very selective in the opportunities that we look for. There are really three criteria that are the same that we talked about before: financial return, strategic alignment, leadership in whatever segments the company is participating in. So those are the things that we look for. The hurdle for us is very high. Obviously we can't talk about anything that we're specifically looking at from an M&A standpoint. But, again, bottom line, we're winning in selection and our strategy is positioning us really well to create value for customers and grow the business.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much. Good luck.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Intel has publicly said that this year's CapEx is an anomaly and that they'll spend more next year. So I'm just trying to reconcile that with your outlook for logic being flat in 2016.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we think, overall, Logic is up somewhat. It's on the up, a little bit up, frankly. And that we don't have classified in Logic Intel's initiative in memory, right? So, that's in their memory bucket. And then the third issue is there's some other cats and dogs or smaller opportunities down below the Intel level, so it's not all Intel. So some of those aren't growing as much as Intel.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Then another clarification I had, Bob, was just on the 14-week quarter, just so we can model April properly, is there much of an impact to revenues in either January or what you would perceive in the April period?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, it's really more of an OpEx management issue and we're kind of mitigating that with two weeks of shutdown to offset the full extra week of OpEx expense.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, and if I could just one for Gary. Gary, as you mentioned, fiscal 2015 was a good year. You grew your revenues. You had record profits and you guys made a lot of progress lowering the share count, OpEx, and the tax rate. The share price, though, is down about 30% over the last 12 months. And I realize that the merger accounts for a lot of the weakness. But just wondering from this standpoint, what the management thinks they can do to improve shareholder value from here.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, as I said before, if you look at our business, break it down into different pieces, foundry is down a significant amount relative to the mix, and if you look at our position in transistor and interconnect when foundry ramps, that is a real strength and really a unique strength for Applied Materials, epi, PVD, implant, CMP, RTP, all of those areas are very strong leadership positions for Applied. The incremental profitability, as that CapEx increases, there's a lot of drop-through to the bottom line.","So the mix this year of memory versus foundry, is different than what we've seen over the last few years. So when foundry comes back, we're in a better position than any company, really, relative to the incremental profitability. The other thing on the foundry is that, at 10-nanometer different than 16-nanometer, there are big changes in terms of the device architecture. Interconnect is growing a significant amount, and our share and number of steps will grow as those devices ramp. So that's one that's a big driver for us when the mix comes back. We've talked about the products that we've introduced, the really tremendous momentum we have in Etch, the CVD, ALD, these areas that are growing for us at a very high rate.","And I still think we're in the early innings relative to the pull that we have from customers. You're going to continue to see growth in those areas as we go forward. And as Bob talked about, our memory position has increased significantly. So as the customers are ramping those 3D NAND technologies, that puts us in a good position. We're growing the service business and we believe it's sustainable growth in service. And as our customers move to new technologies and displays, that's another area where they're adding steps, depositions, materials engineering steps that give us a great opportunity. So you put all those things together, again we're winning in inflection and we really have a great opportunity to grow in all of our different business segments as customers transition to these new technologies.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. I guess first question really is for Gary. So Gary, given the merger that we saw announced, there was a lot of bold moves to sort of shake things up in the industry, I guess, most of what you've done so far is to consolidate markets that you're already in. But if you look sort of to those markets, there's not a whole lot you can do that would really move the needle. So I guess I wanted to ask you about your willingness to sort of look outside of your traditional front end wafer fab equipment markets, maybe into the back end, maybe into some non-semi stuff. Sort of how do you think about the strategic way where you can grow the earnings to $2 or more? It seems like you might have to look outside of your traditional front end WFE markets. Thanks.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Tim, many thanks for the questions. So, again, if you look at our businesses, if you get to a mix of foundry and memory that's more similar to what we've seen in the past. As I said before, our transistor and interconnect business is very, very, very strong. And we see growth in terms of the number of steps, as our customers are transitioning to these next-generation devices. If you look at Etch and deposition, we've grown maybe $1 billion over the last two years or three years. We still think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to grow there going forward. A significant opportunity. One of the things I talked about this last year is that we had a goal of 25 applications wins. We actually won 49 new applications. And that gives us a great tailwind going forward in terms of those areas.","So that's $10 billion market opportunity where our share momentum is strong, we have great products, we're winning applications, critical applications with customers in those areas. So big opportunity for us to grow. Service has grown about $500 million over the last two years. And in display, what we've talked about is the opportunity to triple our TAM. And we could be somewhere around $1 billion in display this year. And there are changes in technology that will happen in display that are also great opportunities for us. So you put all those things together and you have a more normalized mix in terms of memory foundry, mobile, TV, and you have a market around 33.5 billion in wafer fab equipment. We have a lot of momentum to hit the model that we had talked about before.","Now, relative to the areas that you talked about, Tim, all I can say here is that we have the same criteria that we had before, the financial returns, strategic alignment, leadership in whatever businesses that we're looking at, but we really can't comment in a public forum like this on anything that we're looking at. The other thing I would say, though, is we have a very high bar for M&A, but I also believe you miss the 100% of the shots you don't take. We have a great team at Applied Materials, and I think if we find the right opportunity, I have tremendous confidence that we can execute on that opportunity.","Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, see if I can be responsive to your question, Tim, and the investors. There's kind of three ways we move the needle here, there's inorganic stuff, there's organic stuff, and then there's capital returns to investors and how we do that. So if you look at the inorganic stuff, Gary's right, we look at everything, and we're aggressively looking at everything and we're very open-minded to it, so we've closed no doors.","On the organic stuff, I frankly think the results are even better than they even appear. If you look in display and AGS, we're growing them more rapidly than they had in years. If you look at the semi business, if you look by vertical, our highest share is foundry where we've maintained that, we've gained five points of share in the last couple of years in DRAM, five points of share in the transition from 2D NAND to 3D NAND, and we gained three to five points we think in Logic. Okay? So in all the verticals, we're doing well. You say, \"well, I don't see it enough in the P&L.\" Well, foundry's down nine points this year and DRAM's up nine points. I don't think anyone projects that's going to be a sustainable future.","So as we gain share in virtually every vertical, and the mix normalizes, that revenue growth opportunity looks pretty good in the semi business. And in the Etch business, where we're gained, up over $1.1 billion, we start to, in later years, get a lot more service business out of that too because that's a very attractive business.","So within in the organic markets, when you look at performance within vertical, performance by product, performance in terms of revenue growth and also in AGS and display, pretty darn good. No one predicted nine months ago, a year ago, that foundry was going to be down this year and be nine points down as a percentage of CapEx. And nobody predicts it's going to stay that way. We managed to grow revenues, orders, and profit in that environment. And I don't think you go to a cocktail party, anybody says historically Applied is a DRAM company versus a foundry company. But we're growing our DRAM share five points, okay?","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it, Bob. Thank you for that. I guess it was a quick follow-up. Gary, you just talked about $1 billion in revenue. Do you mean you could do $1 billion in display revenue next fiscal year, for fiscal 2016, is that what you mean?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If you were consolidating in display, the display upgrades, it's been in the service business, so that had been segmented out of display, and we're going to consolidate also the web business into display. So you put all those things together, and you get closer to $1 billion. Again, we had segmented out the upgrade business there, which is different than what we've done with some of our other segments. So put all those things together and that's how you get closer to the $1 billion. And what I would say, if you look at \u2013 we can't talk about specifically what customers are doing, but there's some big changes in the display market that could be really great opportunities for us over the next two years to three years to grow that business even further.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, if you look at the revenue growth in display, it's pretty impressive. You know, they were 473 in 2012, 538, 615, 739, 780 and we think next year is a strong year also. And then also we bundled the display upgrades into AGS. So when you gross up the display business, it is probably next year pretty close to $1 billion, all in, including some services, too, I guess. So it's growing pretty well.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. One is for Gary or Bob. You guys highlighted how the last four years was great for foundry spending and now it's moderated this year. If you look at the last four years, it's like smartphone growth is very strong. I'm just kind of curious what makes you think that this year is not the new norm for foundry spending? And along the path, do you think there's going to be any reuse for 10-nanometer foundries? And then I have a follow-up.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll start, you can finish? So if you go look at 2015 a couple of things happened. The biggest thing was if you go look at this, you got to look at the node and the previous node and the next node when you consider spending and reuse. So if you go look, I don't think anyone thought that 20-nanometer was a super device. A lot of customers, and you guys know this, looked forward to the introduction of FinFETs and the FinFET device at 16-nanometer\/14-nanometer was a more powerful device for them in terms of processor and power. Right? So not too many customers did 20-nanometer tape-outs. You know that, right?","What we're seeing is that 16-nanometer\/14-nanometer, by the time they're done, is going to be a big node for tape-outs. So what you had is a fair amount of the equipment at 20-nanometer can move to 16-nanometer\/14-nanometer. So it is the height of the opportunity for reuse because there weren't a lot of tape-outs at 20-nanometer.","Now, when you go to 10-nanometer \u2013 now, the one thing that helped you at 20-nanometer for the one particular customer that went big with 20-nanometer. They buy a fair amount of equipment at the first part of this two node buyout, 20-nanometer\/16-nanometer, so the 10-7, because a lot of the equipment is necessary for interconnect and they buy at the front end, it was two node buying pattern. Now that's very good for Applied, frankly.","So as you look at the transition from 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer versus 16-nanometer to 10-nanometer, the plus, you kind of had them both, is the big spend on interconnect and a little bit of the front end. We benefit from that. What you had as a minus, two minuses kind of at the 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer node, a lot of people moved their demand from 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer and there wasn't a lot of backfill. So 16-nanometer projects to be a big long node, so a lot of that capacity is going to stay there and not move to 10-nanometer. So you're going to get a fair amount of buying at the 10-nanometer node. So we think 10-nanometer is a pretty big spending node for us and I think the customers say that too.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And many new steps, also.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And many new steps. If you look at the interconnect stuff, it's up high percentage and that's a very good sweet spot for us. 10-nanometer will be big because you've got a node before you at 16-nanometer\/14-nanometer, that's a powerful node, so not going to going move everything to 10-nanometer, they're going to keep a lot at 16-nanometer\/14-nanometer. They're still growing. And then 10-nanometer will be good because you've got the FinFET and you've got the new interconnect. You didn't have the new FinFET at 20-nanometer.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I'm kind of curious, and I understand the thought process on the M&A side, I'm just curious more on the organic development side. If I look at your some of the products there that investing or trying to gain traction, for example, offset a dielectric Etch there, there's not been a whole lot of traction. And also the E-Beam products where it looks like Hermes has already won that battle and it might be a niche market. I'm kind of curious, what are the thought process in the organic product developments? Are you guys looking to hit singles from this or do you expect this to be a big home run, driving like $500 million or $1 billion revenue stream?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would say in Etch with Sym3, we went from something like 10 chambers to close to 500 chambers, 450 chambers in five quarters. We've never seen a ramp like that at Applied Materials and you very rarely see that kind of adoption anywhere in the industry. And I was traveling actually most of the last six weeks with pretty much all of our major customers. The pull is really phenomenal. I talked about the 49 application wins in Etch and CVD. We have tremendous, tremendous pull from customers and we're winning critical applications also. This is not just non-critical applications. Some of the most critical applications, the design of our technology is outperforming the competition. So we look at that \u2013 the Etch business, $6 billion market, it's a great opportunity for us.","Relative to your question on dielectric Etch, again, you have a $6 billion market, we certainly have gained share, but our position going forward on new applications is also very, very strong. And the pull from customers is tremendous. So our focus has been really on conductor Etch. We wanted to go where we had the best opportunities, where we could create the most value for the customers. We continue to focus on areas that are the best fit for our differentiated technology and customer high value problems. And I can tell you, there's still a lot of room there for us to grow in the Etch business. So tremendous growth over the last few years, but still phenomenal pull and momentum and opportunity for us going forward.","In E-Beam inspection, I wouldn't say the game is anywhere close to over. Our PDC business, the majority of our revenue in PDC comes from E-Beam products. We have very strong position in E Beam review. We've gained some share in CD SEM, CD metrology also. And really the focus there is around the most critical imaging applications. We have world class electron optics, and the team is bringing that technology leadership now into E-Beam inspection and we have a great opportunity going forward. So I wouldn't say \u2013 again, I've been in this kind of a business for a long, long time. I don't think this game is anywhere close to over. We have a great opportunity there.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. Gary, you mentioned that the foundry is stronger in the second half. I was wondering if you can provide us some comments on the linearity of next year for your overall silicon business. Is it stronger in the first half or second half, and how does it compare to the second half calendar this year?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So if you go look, Farhan, this is Bob. So in 2015, WFE for the industry, we think for the total WFE was probably like 48%-52% something like that. I personally think next year WFE is all of that and maybe a little more back-end loaded because in 2015 you had foundry back-end loaded more and you get that again next year. But I think the memory is not \u2013 it's pretty good memory year by the next year but not as strong in the front end as it was this year, okay? So I think 48%-52%, it's that or more than that next year in terms of back-end load. That's for the industry.","Now for Applied Materials, we always tend to be back-end loaded just because the way we run quarters and December calendar year-end. So this year, I think, we were like 57% in the second calendar half, 43%-57%. I don't want to give an exact number, but I don't know why it would be any different than that. Because I think the industry is somewhere where we're strong, foundry and V-NAND is more second half, so I think you're talking those type of numbers.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't want to give hard numbers, but it's similar to this year.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, overall, it should be very similar for the overall business in terms of the linearity?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, it might even be a little more second half next year, but pretty similar.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And then in terms of your capital returns, you obviously raised some debt recently. How are you thinking about the $3 billion buyback now? Do you still think it will take up to two years or do you think it will be much faster than that? Just at the rate at which you're going, it seems like you could be almost done within like a year. And second, in terms of your dividend, how are you thinking about it?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we did $625 million in the first quarter, which wasn't a full quarter. We did $700 million on the buyback in the second quarter, that's $1,325 million. And then we have a matrix that tracks the volume by the price. So my guess is that Q3 is a good size buyback, maybe not quite as big as the \u2013 next quarter, I think, might be a good size number, somewhere between the first two quarters we did, is my guess. But it depends on the stock price, right? In terms of, we originally said we'd get done three years, then two years, it may be shorter than two years but I don't want to predict it right now, because it's based on stock prices at any given point.","Oh, and the dividend is the other question. We addressed \u2013 the dividend is a board decision. We had that meeting in like February\/March with the board every year. The board's always been very supportive of all forms of cash returns to investors. In fact, if you look at Applied over the last one year, three year, five year, I think even 10 years, we've returned about 100% of free cash flow to investors. So the board will talk to us about a dividend versus buyback versus other things in February\/March. And I think they'll be open-minded on everything. But no decisions were made.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. That's all I had.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question. On the Lam-KLA deal, one of the revenue synergy opportunities that they talked about as a rationale for the deal, and they put the synergies at about $600 million within five years, is on the integration rights. And the integration in situ or standalone of the process tools and the process control tools. Obviously, the Applied team has got somewhat similar capabilities on both sides. How do you see the opportunity for more process control integration with your process tools? And if they're right, then should you be looking at a similar opportunity? It would be great to get your thoughts here.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, yeah. Thanks for the question. So on, just, I want to clarify, you're talking about integrated process control, is that the question?","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, integrated process control, whether it's in situ or standalone.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Great. Yeah. Thanks. So if you look at integrated process control, the adoption has been very limited over time. There are a few examples, CMP is one. Another one that has some adoption is ASML's YieldStar product. It's not a new concept. We have a very good understanding of these opportunities, but we really can't comment on our strategy and either company's long-term road map. But I would say that we have a very, very good understanding of this particular area.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the AGS revenues, up 15% in fiscal year 2015. Solid performance, the team has been focusing on its services and monetizing its manufacturing IP and knowhow. Within the framework for a flat WFE spending year next year, do you expect your AGS business to outgrow the industry and outgrow your overall SSG business in fiscal year 2016 as well?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We think AGS has a very good opportunity to grow their revenue line next year, and I think they're in very good shape to hit the model we put up for 2018. In terms of whether they outgrow the semi business or not, and a lot of variables in terms of WFE spending. But I think they're going to have a strong year. They had a really great year this year.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yep. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Hi, Gary, Bob. Just a follow-up question about DRAM WFE in 2016 being down significantly. Do you think DRAM as a percentage of WFE goes back to 14% of total WFE, compared to 25%? Is that kind of the way to think about your definition of being down significantly?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't want to give a hard number. We think it's down, but not down that far.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for sharing that. And then just a follow-up question on market share. It sounds like you're Etch and deposition market share did quite well this year. Now that Lam and KLA are combining, is this typically a time that Applied will take even more market share in Etch, deposition, and maybe even in inspection as those companies look to integrate?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, what I would say in Etch, deposition and inspection, we have, as I said earlier, incredible pull from customers in Etch and deposition. Especially as they're moving to new device technologies. There's a lot of new materials that are going to be implemented where we have a very strong position. I talked about the number of applications wins earlier. So we already have very strong pull from customers, with the enabling technologies, the new platforms that we have implemented in those areas. Also very, very strong pull from customers on inspection. Deeper technologies engagements than we've ever had before, as our customers are moving to these new device structures. And really a great opportunity, really great opportunity. Strong pull from customers.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. Bob, I'm assuming flat WFE next year, AGS sales up. How should we think about OpEx dollars in terms of absolute dollars into next year?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","For the whole company?","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we'll be year \u2013 fiscal year \u2013 fiscal, yeah, we'd like to be down a little bit, or flat to down a little bit.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then as a follow-up, I believe there was a $13 million small negative adjustment in the backlog, can you talk about what \u2013 where that was? Was it in silicon? And which end market?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, we had a backlog adjustment earlier in the year in foundry, as you remember, and then I think we had some FX. Hold on. I'm looking it up.","$13 million was \u2013 yeah, there's a cancellation. There's a bunch of small ones, really. There's no big pattern. Currency adjust was $27 million. That's buried in there too. So those $27 million was foreign exchange, $24 million in SSG, $3 million in solar. So a lot of it was foreign exchange movement too.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And one last one. On the services side, is it possible to provide some kind of percentage for 200 millimeter refurbished equipment? Is it more like 10%, 20% of your services sales or higher?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'm sorry. I missed \u2013 I didn't hear the whole question.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","The 200 millimeter refurbished equipment sales as a percentage of overall services sales?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we don't break that out. What we've said is that it was strong year for 200 millimeter tool sales, up a fair amount from last year. And we think it'll be pretty strong next year too. There's couple of big demand drivers there. One is, you don't quite realize it, but your average cellphone's got a lot of sensors in there, so a lot of those sensors are made of 200 millimeter devices. The second is, the whole automobile and sensors business is growing quite a bit. So both of those look like they'll be pretty good next year too.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks. And I think, Kyle, we have time for just about one more question, please.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Pacific Crest. Your line is open.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your comments on inspection, where you said you're seeing very strong customer pull. Was that more related to just the new UVision platform or were you referring to E-Beam inspection? And if it was E-Beam related, I'm wondering if you can give us an idea of how much of a revenue contribution that could be in 2016?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so in UVision we have a good position in foundry and logic. Also we had a recent multiple tool order in memory for the UVision 7, so we're making progress there in that part of the business. On the E-Beam area, again, as I said before, we have really very strong electron optics. We've got a strong position in E-Beam review and putting all that together, we think it's a great opportunity for us. We're not ready to quantify the exact number in terms of the potential there, but it is a fast growing part of the market and with the technology and the team we have, we think that it's a good opportunity going forward.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, that that helps. And then as a follow-up, I was wondering, on the last call you said you were ramping down some businesses and you plan to cut anything really sustainably below 20% OP margin and I was just wondering if there were any significant cuts this quarter that you could talk about.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, it's hard to talk about those in advance. We consistently screen all the businesses. The one that consistently we're ramping down is the solar business, frankly, because the market is bad. Right? But other than that we don't have much we would talk about right now.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Thank you, Wes. And we'd like to thank, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. I\u2019m Mike Sullivan, Head of Investor Relations at Applied Materials. We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied\u2019s current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied\u2019s most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s estimates, projections and assumptions as of August 16, 2018, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them.","Today\u2019s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today\u2019s earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our Web site at appliedmaterials.com.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks Mike. I\u2019m pleased to report that our revenue for the quarter was up 19% compared to the same period last year and the second highest in the Company's history. Fiscal 2018 remains on track to be another record setting year for Applied Materials, and we expect each of our major businesses to deliver strong double-digit growth.","In today's call, I\u2019ll start by providing our perspective on the market environment and our business performance. Then I\u2019ll lay out our views on the industry's future growth drivers and describe how we\u2019re evolving our strategy to take full advantage of the tremendous opportunities ahead. In aggregate, we see ongoing strength in our markets. Customers are making rational investments in new capacity resulting in well balanced supply demand dynamics. At the same time, they are aggressively pursuing their development roadmaps with healthy spending on next generation technologies. Demand for wafer fab equipment is on track to be an all-time record in 2018, and our view of 2019 remains positive, our thesis that spending in 2018 plus 2019 combined will exceed $100 billion remains firmly intact. The details within our 2018 forecast are consistent with the view we shared during our last call with the exception of a recent downward revision to our foundry outlook.","As foundry customers optimize existing capacity, they\u2019ve trimmed their capital spending plans for the year. They are still pushing forward with leading-edge developments, prioritizing current investment towards long lead time equipment, which is a positive leading indicator for 2019. NAND bit demand is expected to grow at about 40% this year with bit supply growing slightly faster. As a result, we see spending levels flat to modestly down from last year's record levels.","DRAM investments are strong, up approximately 50% year-over-year as customers invest in capacity and technology to meet growing demand for high-performance DRAM for data centers. Capital investments by the leading cloud service providers continues to strengthen, up about 85% year to date compared to 2017. And in line with our prior view we also expect, logic investments to be higher this year.","Stepping back and looking at the broader context, 2018 shows how the industry has fundamentally changed over the past five years. More diverse demand drivers spanning consumer and enterprise markets combined with very disciplined investment has reduced cyclicality. We\u2019re not seeing the large fluctuations in wafer fab equipment spending that we did in the past. Over the same time period, we've also driven significant changes within Applied that have resulted in a larger, less volatile and more resilient business. In semiconductor, we've gained 7 points of market share in memory since 2013, while maintaining our traditionally strong position in logic foundry. As a result, we are now very well balanced across market segments.","We\u2019ve built the strong portfolio of products that addressed major technology inflections. For example, by developing tools for next generation multi patterning, we have grown our patterning business in DRAM, logic and foundry from about $100 million in 2013 to more than $1 billion this year. We expect our patterning opportunity to grow by another billion dollars as EUV and new materials enabled patterning steps are adopted over the next five years.","In display, we have scaled the business from about $600 million in 2012 to approximately $2.5 billion this year. In both TV and mobile, customers are investing in new technologies and that plays directly to Applied\u2019s strengths. We expect display to remain a powerful growth driver for the Company over the long-term.","In Service, we have grown revenue at 15% compound annual growth rate since 2014. As we look ahead we\u2019re confident that we can sustain at least that pace of growth, driven by our growing install base, customers placing a larger portion of tools under long-term service agreements and new advanced service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield and optimize operating costs. When look at the Company as a whole, about 40% of our revenue today comes from sources other than new semiconductor equipment sales. Combined, our services, spares, upgrades, consulting, software and display and flexible technology businesses, will generate more than $7 billion of revenue this year. This ramp and diversity gives us confidence in our ability to sustain strong performance under a variety of market conditions and provide a great platform for future growth.","I strongly believe that the most exciting days for the industry and Applied are ahead of us. Over the next decade, AI and Big Data will transform almost every sector of the economy and be a major growth driver for electronics and semi conductors. AI is already driving a significant increase in hardware research and investment from a broad range of companies, because it requires new computing at the edge and in the cloud, lower cost, lower power chips and abundant storage.","In these early innings of AI, the industry is focused on addressing two major technology inflections; first, the development of new computing architectures customized for specific training or inference workloads; and second, overcoming the deceleration of Moore's Law scaling. This is driving new types of innovation across the ecosystem. We believe that future improvements in chip performance, power, area and costs needed to enable the AI era will be driven by a combination of five factors; new chip architectures; new structures within the chip, including 3D; new materials; new ways to shrink chip geometries, including EUV lithography and self-aligned patterning; and new ways to connect chips together, using advanced packaging techniques. All five of these approaches will require major advances in materials engineering and create huge opportunities for applied.","The AI Big Data era is a catalyst for applied to play a bigger and broader role than ever before. Our first priority is to be the most valuable partner for our customers. The introduction of more novel materials, combined with new structures to improve performance and costs, means that integration challenges in the chip manufacturing process are increasingly complex. Our broad portfolio of technology and our ability to understand the interaction between materials creation, materials removal and materials modification is tremendously valuable. As a result, we are seeing customers engaging Applied in earlier and deeper collaborations to develop unique solutions, focused on device performance and yield.","One example of how we\u2019re doing this is integrated material solutions, where we can combine multiple processes together, typically within a single system. We launched our first integrated material system in June, but this is just the start. We have a very robust pipeline of integrated products, several of which we expect to come to market in 2019. We\u2019re also expanding our engagements within the AI ecosystem and finding new ways to create value with our technology. For example, we recently announced collaboration with ARM to develop a neuromorphic switch that can enable new approaches to AI computing. This program is part of DARPA's electronics resurgence initiative to develop new computing materials, designs and architectures.","In July, we hosted the industry's first AI Design Forum with over 700 attendees spanning system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community. The common message from participants was that the ecosystem needs to work together in new ways to bring AI technologies to market faster and at lower cost. Applied has highly differentiated technologies and capabilities to accelerate new materials and systems like our Maydan Technology Center that enables rapid testing of new concepts and designs.","To further accelerate materials innovation and our ability to connect across the ecosystem, we\u2019re expanding capacity and capabilities. In addition, we\u2019re applying AI and Big Data methods within our own research and development teams. We\u2019re partnering with leading AI companies and making infrastructure investments to significantly increase learning rates.","Before I turn the call over to Dan, I\u2019ll quickly summarize. Industry fundamentals remain strong, with customers making disciplined investments in capacity and new technologies, Applied's performance remain strong. 2018 will be another record year for all of our major businesses, and our outlook for 2019 is positive and we see a very bright future ahead. We\u2019re expanding engagements with current and new customers to position the Company to play a larger and more valuable role in the AI, Big Data era.","Now, Dan will give his perspective on our performance and outlook.","Dan Durn","Thanks, Gary. In Q3, Applied delivered revenue and non-GAAP earnings that were both within 2% of the all-time records we set last quarter. On a year-over-year basis we generated strong revenue growth, and increased non-GAAP EPS by 40%, even as our memory customers made capacity adjustments during the period.","We continue to see the wafer fab equipment market and Applied Materials being sustainably larger and less cyclical today than in the past and as Gary outlined, our outlook for 2019 and the longer term remains very positive. Given the adjustments in memory markets along with recent foundry CapEx reductions, I want to offer you a little help this quarter with how we see demand profiling from 2018 into 2019. My philosophy is to tell you what I see today based on our market analysis and customer engagements. I can't guarantee what happens in the economy in policy circles or in our markets, but I\u2019m happy to be transparent with you and let you make your own judgment about the external factors.","Our fiscal Q4 business outlook calls for semiconductor systems revenue to decline by about 4% year-over-year with non-GAAP earnings to increase by about 3% year-over-year at the midpoint to $0.96. From what I can see today, semiconductor systems revenue will be flat to slightly higher sequentially in Q1. Non-GAAP earnings will be slightly higher sequentially in Q1 as well, even when you include $0.05 headwind from an increase in our tax rate that takes effect in fiscal 2019. Our current outlook in the Q2 and the balance of fiscal 2019 is for continued growth.","Returning to the bigger picture Gary described. You may notice how resilient the industry and the Company have become, particularly given the supply and demand adjustments now taking place in memory. Some of us remember the steep cyclicality of the past, but here's the news. We expect trough non-GAAP quarterly earnings of $0.96 in Q4. To put this into perspective, $0.96 also happens to be the average of our full-year earnings in the six years from 2010 through 2015. We can now generate the same level of earnings in a single quarter. This comparison demonstrates the benefits of Applied's breadth and growth. In semi, while our memory systems revenue declined by 19% sequentially in Q3, our overall systems business was down by half that amount. This demonstrates the benefits of our balanced revenue share across device types.","Applied\u2019s display business has grown nearly $2 billion as compared to 2012, and the best indication of Applied\u2019s resilience is our services business. This quarter, AGS posted its 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. In fact, Applied has the industry's largest install base of more than 40,000 systems, and we\u2019re shipping over 2,000 new 300 millimeter systems this year alone. This year's record shipments will further expand our services opportunity next year.","In fact, due to the increasing trust our customers are placing in our services products, we are now generating about half of our services revenue from long-term agreements. I am sometimes asked to quantify the total proportion of our semi-related business that comes from servicing the install base. The answer is 32%. That\u2019s AGS excluding display services plus 300 millimeter upgrades in refurbishments, which are reported as part of our semiconductor systems group segment. So Applied generates more install base revenue than any other company in our industry.","Now let\u2019s summarize our third quarter results. We generated operating income of $1.3 billion, which was up 22% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP EPS was $1.20 which was $0.03 above the midpoint benefiting from higher revenue, as well as lower tax rate and share count.","Turning to the segments, our semiconductor systems group delivered revenue that was slightly above the midpoint of our expectations. Our services revenue was up 21% year-over-year, which was slightly lower than the midpoint of our Q3 expectations, but well above our long-term growth target. AGS posted another all-time record in both revenue and operating income. Our display group delivered revenue that was slightly above the midpoint and also set new records in both revenue and operating income.","Turning to the balance sheet. Gary talked about the many initiatives we\u2019re driving to accelerate innovation. We invested $133 million in capital improvements that were primarily aimed at expanding our capabilities in both R&D and manufacturing to support our customers. This quarter, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders. We paid out the first $0.20 dividend and we used $1.25 billion to repurchase 25 million shares of our stock. Over the last 12 months alone, we've repurchased 92 million shares, or 9% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of that period. And we still have about $5 billion remaining in buyback authorization.","Now I\u2019ll share our business outlook for Q4. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4.15 billion. Within the outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to decline by about 4% year-over-year. This forecast includes the impact of recent foundry CapEx reductions. Our services revenue should increase by about 15% year-over-year, and our display revenue should grow by about 2% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP gross margin should be around 45.4% and our non-gap operating expenses should be in the range of $765 million plus or minus $10 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.92 to $1.","Now that you have our financial expectations for the full 2018 fiscal year and our positive view of 2019, I'd like to give you an interim update on our 2020 financial model, in the context of the new opportunities Gary has been describing. Q3 was a very busy quarter for us and I was delighted to see more than 160 of you at our investor breakfast at Semicon West. At the AI Design Forum, Gary shared the stage with Nvidia, IBM and many of the world's top experts and startups. Two weeks later, Gary joined Nvidia, Intel and others at the DARPA ERI Summit, showing how we can use materials engineering to accelerate AI, even as Moore's Law slows. DARPA awarded millions of dollars to Applied, Arm and our research partners to explore new material for neuromorphic computing. These are early indications of the work we are now going to drive growth for our Company and our customers.","So based on the current view of our markets, our evolving strategy and our financial performance, we are confident that we will exceed our goal of earning $5.08 per share in our 2020 fiscal year. Specifically, we expect semi-systems revenue to be more than $11.6 billion in fiscal 2020. We believe $50 billion in the new normal for this industry. And that WFE will keep pace with the revenue growth of the industry. We also expect services plus display revenue of more than $8 billion. Within the mix, we see services revenue being above our prior expectations, fully offsetting display revenue, which we expect to be in 2020 but still below our original target.","We continue to expect gross margin of 47% and operating margin of 29.6% our non GAAP tax rate should be slightly higher than the prior expectations of 10% due to the new tax rules. Additionally, our share count is already below $1 billion versus the original goal of $1.024 billion. And we\u2019ll continue to return excess cash to our investors.","Now I turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Dan. And now to help us reach as many of you as, we can please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please just call the operator, we\u2019ll do our best to answer it later in the call. Let\u2019s please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","C.J. Muse","I guess for my question, can you talk to just adjustments that you saw both memory and foundry recently. And then as you think about calendar \u201919, can you discuss the puts and takes in terms of how you\u2019re seeing each of the end markets, whether foundry, logic, DRAM, NAND. And as part of that if you could include your thoughts around clean room availability and timing of investments through the calendar year? Thank you.","Dan Durn","Given the announcements in the last month, we\u2019re now seeing some movements in foundry capital spending. That's reflected in the guidance we just provided for fiscal Q4. All other assumptions from last quarter still holds true. To give you more color on what we're seeing in foundry, we continue to see growth in trailing node geometries. The split between leading edge and trailing node geometries historically was 80-20 then it became 60-40. Today, it\u2019s more like 50-50. And specifically, in 2018, we see trailing node spend up and leading edge node spend down. And on the leading edge, we\u2019re seeing a prioritization towards spend to very long lead time items, which we believe is a good indicator of our business going into 2019 and beyond. In 2019, we expect both leading and trailing node geometries to be healthy.","When we look at 2018 and 2019, just to provide the broader context; 2017 was an all-time record; 2018 is likely to be the new record being up over '17; and we\u2019re seeing strength across all device types. Gary, in his prepared comments said 2018 plus 2019 combined will exceed $100 billion. And I think it\u2019s too early to make a point estimate on either year. But based on customer conversations we\u2019re having, 2019 will be above $50 billion and still healthy across all device types. And so we're really seeing a strong end market and how things profile into 2019.","Gary Dickerson","And I think C.J. I might add a comment something about capacity at the fab level for some of it. So I think [multiple speakers] view hasn\u2019t really changed.","Dan Durn","Yes, so the best I can get to from a capacity standpoint is we\u2019re tracking 32, 300 mm factories around the globe that still have to be facilitized. The average size of those 31 fabs is about 72,000 wafer starts per month and it represents about 200 billion of potential floor space for WFE equipment. So in terms of ability to deploy capacity in a fairly rapid fashion, I think the infrastructure and the build is out there. I think it\u2019s just a matter of letting the demand led environment lead our customers\u2019 investment profile to maintain rational supply demand dynamics and strong pricing in their markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Atif Malik","Dan, thank you for updating us on the $5 2020 target model. I have a question on the display segment. It looks like you guys are on track to do 30% year-over-year growth for fiscal '18. On the last earnings call, you guys talked about the decline of 15% to 20% for fiscal '19. I was curious if anything has changed to that outlook in the mobile or the DE markets? Thank you.","Dan Durn","So our display forecast is really unchanged similar to what we communicated previously. As you said, '18 is going to be around $2.5 billion, up more than 30% from the previous year and up from $600 million in 2012, so tremendous growth overall in display. And we still see 2019 down in the 15% range and 2020 to be higher than 2018. In terms of mix, 2018-2019 is more weighted towards TV and one thing I\u2019d remind everybody for large-screen TVs, if you compare Gen 10.5 to Gen 8.5 you get eight TVs versus three. So our view on the TV market is similar to what we previously communicated. And overall again we see 2020 up over 2018 continue to see display as a great growth driver for the company. Future technology inflections are more capital-intensive and we have a pipeline of new capabilities that create a strong opportunity for future growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu of Newstreet Research. Your line is now open.","Pierre Ferragu","I\u2019d like to come back very rapidly on C.J.\u2019s question and really make a difference between memory and logic. So if I understood you correctly than what you're saying is that in memory what you saw three months ago and that led you to tell us you could reasonably expect sequential growth between Q3 and Q4 in semiconductor system, that outlook didn\u2019t change which meant that the low points in memory was Q3 and things should be improving from there based on your visibility today. And then the new thing is only logic and the push back to put out you mentioned about logic. And then on the back of that, my question would be how much confidence do you have in Q4 numbers is also baking in low points in logic, which means that we would have gone through in just a couple of quarters a pull back in memory and a pull back in logic and with therefore limited reason so they\u2019re negative surprise down the line?","Gary Dickerson","A couple of comments, on the memory side, everything that is out in the market today from an information standpoint it was reflected in our guide and that's playing out as we thought, so there's no incremental news or information. And the delta between what we thought -- how we thought Q4 was going to profile three months ago versus what we\u2019re guiding to today is a foundry driven dynamic. So you used the word logic we differentiate between logic and foundry. And so I just want to be clear that our view is coming out of the foundry market. And it was versus our expectations on how Q4 was going to profile. So that is the big delta between what we thought three months ago. And as we roll the clock forward, the spending in foundry today is being driven by very long lead time items, which we see as a lead indicator for our business where the lead times are much shorter as capacity comes online to meet customer demand. So I think the set up around 2019 for us as a result of that in the foundry market looks good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Steven Chin","Gary, earlier you mentioned some comments on the NAND market specifically what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the demand growth of about 40% and supply growth little bit more in that. Just wondering if you could give us a little more color on how you see the NAND WFE profile going to the back end of this year and maybe into 2019, just based on some of those comments. And I guess the implication would be there might be some pricing pressure in the NAND market of the demand continues to play out. And if so would you expect that NAND WFE to see some slow down towards the back end of the year, because of pricing or do you think investments in upgrades to the 96 layers or above if that will continue and hence continue to keep NAND WFE strong?","Dan Durn","So I guess here is the comment that I would make on the NAND market. We signaled a quarter ago that we\u2019re going to see some back half weakness I think that\u2019s playing out as we expected. In Gary prepared comments, he talked about the NAND market being down year-over-year versus 2017, we see that playing out. And as we look at the health of the market, if we take a step back and just look at the macro drivers driving semiconductor demand today, those macro drivers are impact and playing out as expected, things like artificial intelligence and data economy are going to drive structurally larger semiconductor industry demand as the demand for those devices to fuel those trends increases over time.","As we take a look at customer profitability, it's better today than it's ever been. And they're investing a lot of money. But as a percentage of their profitability, it\u2019s down substantially since 2012. In the memory market over that time period, CapEx as a percentage of the EBITDA is down 40%. And the customers are doing a better job of modulating supply and making demand lead investments. There will always be adjustments from a supply-demand standpoint to keep those markets in balance. And I think our customers have done a good job to strike the right balance in the environment that we\u2019re in. And as we look forward into 2019, I\u2019ll come back to an earlier comment on one of the earlier questions. We see a healthy dynamic across all four device types into 2019.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Guys similar to your U.S. peers, you\u2019re calling your October quarter as the bottom, a little bit different than U.S. peers. They\u2019re a little bit emphatic about growth into their December quarter your January quarter. And I am just curious is that a function of your being over-indexed for foundry or not as indexed to 5 nano-meter on the process equipment side, i.e. if you were to look at your domestic peers and compare the apples-to apples-business. Would you be more confident that your January semi equipment business would be up sequentially?","Dan Durn","So I think there is a couple things that play, John. And thanks for question. The first thing I would say is it's hard for me to know exactly what the assumptions were in each of the competitors\u2019 and peers\u2019 forecasts. So it's hard to make a direct comparison of what we see differently than others. What I would say is as our guide reflects everything we see our footprint is broader than our peers. We\u2019re exposed to more of those end markets and device types. And the guidance we have reflects our view of the world and the conversations we\u2019re having with our customers.","From a foundry specific standpoint, we emphasize the fact that spending on the leading edge today is prioritizing some very long lead time items for capacity that will come online in the next year, 18 months which is a nice set up for shorter lead time tools, which creates a nice opportunity for us going into 2019. So it\u2019s hard to be very specific on a comparative basis of how we\u2019re profiling differently than others. All we can try to do is be transparent with what we see developing in the market and how our conversations with customers are profiling.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","Can you guys just help us understand the dynamics around the foundry push-outs? If I look at SEMICON coverage universe, some of the big complex as we see guys, Qualcomm, AMD, Xilinx, Qualcomm, so on, 7 nanometer tape out looks actually quite significant that\u2019s going to start to around beginning of next year. So if you could just help us understand the rationale for your views on what you think in terms of why the push-out of investments here into second half of this year? And maybe just also address the breath of the foundry push-out. Is it primarily one customer or is it multiple customers?","Dan Durn","As we take a look at the foundry segment, what we can reflect in our guide is what gets communicated from our customer base. And the customers have done a very good job in the foundry space, managing a supply statement commensurate with where they see demand coming from. As you now, tape outs come and capacity gets put in place. And so there's a pretty close synchronization in that market as the business materialize, capacity gets deployed to meet that demand statement. So we feel pretty good that what's in the market today from a capacity standpoint is able to absorb the demand that's coming into the foundry space.","The second part of your question, over the past month, we\u2019ve been reading about public comments on adjustment in the foundry spending reflects conversations we have with the customer base. You\u2019re now seeing that reflected in our guidance going forward. The adjustment we\u2019re seeing is primarily from what you've been reading about, but not exclusively one customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.","Romit Shah","I guess two part from me, and I mean you made the comment, Gary, in your prepared remarks that the business is seeing less fluctuations. But you three months ago said that July was going to be the bottom and October would grow and now you\u2019re guiding October revenues down about 10%. So how was it that the business is more aligned and less cyclical than what we\u2019ve seen [Technical Difficulty]? And I guess as a second part to that DRAM spending, I understand the strong, but all indications are that DRAM price is going to be down in Q4. So what gives you confidence that this isn\u2019t the next -- DRAM is not the next year to drop? Thank you.","Gary Dickerson","When we contemplated our July guidance and how October was going to profile, it was conditioned on set of conversations and a set of knowledge that was in the market. Subsequent to that, there was an adjustment in spend profiles in the foundry space, so new information became available and our guidance reflects all of the information that's out there today. When I take a step back and we talk about resilience and we talk about less cyclicality, let's talk about the overall markets and then specifically apply it to Applied Materials. 2017 in the WFE space was an all-time record year. 2018 is going to be up over \u201817 with strength across all device types in an environment where we\u2019re talking about re-profiling of both, memory and foundry spend. And so I think that's a pretty strong statement from an end market standpoint that the industry is evolving in ways that I think will accrue benefits to us going forward.","When we take a step back and look at Applied specifically in an environment characterized by those same pressures re-profiling memory and foundry spend. We talked about EPS in my prepared comments a single quarter is now larger than what this company used to do in a full year just a short time ago. And I think that's a pretty strong statement that our business is more resilient and less cyclical than we've seen in the past. So we feel pretty good about that context in those statements. And Romit, what was the second part of your question?","Romit Shah","I was curious about DRAM, DRAM spending has been strong, but it looks like in Q4 DRAM prices could be down. And given that we saw earlier in the year weakness in NAND that preclude a decline in NAND spend. And I guess I'm [Technical Difficulty]\u2026","Gary Dickerson","So I guess the best way I would address that Romit is there can always be changes in markets what we\u2019re giving perspective on today is what we're seeing in the market. The supply demand balance has been reasonably [Technical Difficulty] from DRAM standpoint, it\u2019s led to pricing stability. It's something the customers monitor very granularly. And they\u2019ve been very disciplined, from an investment standpoint, making demand led investments. Taking a step back [Technical Difficulty] I think the longer term demand drivers around silicon, DRAM, NAND, logic, foundry, all device types, are still there. And so if there are short-term disruptions, I don't think it takes -- it changes our long-term view of how these markets evolve. And so we view the market still is healthy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri of UBS Securities. Your line is now open.","Tim Arcuri","Dan, I wanted to ask a question about SSG share. So even if I assume like $51 billion this year, which it sounds like it\u2019s probably going to be at least that, if not higher. Other guys are saying $52 billion or $53 billion. It still looks like based upon your guidance for the fiscal Q1 that you\u2019re still going to lose a little bit of WFE share this year after losing a little bit last year as well. Now maybe that $51 billion number is too high or something. But even if I look at the 2020 model, your comments on that, you said SSG is going to still be about $11.6 billion or higher, which is in line with your model. But your old model was at $45 billion WFE. And now it seems like you're saying that $50 billion is the new normal. So it seems like the share assumption has come down a bit, so I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s your read into all that? Thanks.","Gary Dickerson","So I think -- so last year, the share wasn\u2019t down. I think if you go back to the previous six years, the share was up or flat, mostly up in all of the previous six years. So if you take an overall look at the Company over the last few years. One of the big things that we've driven is a much better balance across all device types. So if go back to 2013, we had only greater than 20% share in foundry, less than 15% share in NAND, DRAM and logic. Since 2013, we\u2019ve grown the memory revenue 5x and 7% share growth and almost 2x growth in revenue and logic. So again, tremendous balance across all the device types versus really just being more foundry focus. And what I would say going forward that certain Dan reiterated that we would exceed the model for 2020.","And if I look at the Company, how we\u2019re positioned, we\u2019re in a great position for next technology nodes, a very strong pipeline of new products across many markets and compelling integrated material solutions, and we talked about some of that over the last two months. And in the new products in material solutions we\u2019ll introduce some significant new capabilities in the next 12 months and beyond. And also, if you look from a macro perspective, I was the speaker at the AI Design Forum and the DARPA conferences and some of the themes that came out of that were around AI, Big Data being a major opportunity, at the same time, Moore's Law's challenged. So at those conferences and you see many people talking about the future being about materials, new structures, 3D driving future innovation, enabling AI, Big Data, power performance area and cost, future logic, memory, patterning packaging. And at one of those conferences, I gave examples of new capabilities, including three orders of magnitude improvement leakage current that provides lower power performance. And there\u2019s again a very large value in time-to-market.","So when you think about going from materials to systems, there's tremendous value in accelerating that whole process going from materials, to single process test, to integrated materials, to structures, to devices, to packages, to systems. And I really deeply feel Applied\u2019s never been in a better position to use our breath to enable these new capabilities. So bottom line from a position standpoint, we've never been in a better position. We have a very strong pipeline of new products integrated material solutions, and Applied really to the foundation of accelerating these AI, Big Data industry inflections.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Toshiya Hari","Gary, I was hoping to get an update on how you view your near and medium term opportunity in China. Obviously, there's lots going on from a political\/trade perspective. I think some of your customers are making some progress on the technology front. I think one of your NAND customers had a pretty big presence at the Flash Memory Summit last week. So just curious what you're seeing today, and if you've seen any pull-ins from your customers in China? Thank you.","Gary Dickerson","Our current forecast for China is in line with our prior assumptions. 2018 is going to be a great year for Applied. We\u2019ll grow faster than the market. And based on our mitigation plans, we don't see any meaningful impact from tariffs that have imposed that I know people are wondering about. So overall, strong position in China. Regarding the geopolitical situation, certainly, we believe in fair trade and that successful resolution -- the current situation is important the overall ecosystem. And we believe that\u2019s the likely ultimate outcome. Relative to Applied, we will continue to monitor the impact of any future developments to Applied supply chain customers and take any actions that are needed to mitigate impact to Applied and our customers.","Relative to technology positions, I think nothing has really changed versus what we thought before. China will continue to incrementally invest. This year, the domestic business is more heavily weighted to foundry logic than memory. Similar to 2017 was more foundry logic. 2019 we see more weighted towards foundry logic. But China will definitely continue to incrementally invest. We don't see any hockey-stick relative to future investment. And we still believe it\u2019s going to take a long time for their technology to mature to get anywhere close to leading-edge. But again, incrementally, we still see China as a very positive market for Applied.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Patrick Ho","Gary, in the past Analyst Days, which by the way we have an update on when you think this year the Analyst Day you will be where and when. You\u2019ve talked about capital intensity trends, particularly for the NAND industry and how that\u2019s positively impacted Applied Materials as the industry moves to 96 layers and above. Can you give us a little bit of an update on Applied\u2019s position both in its core edge and disposition businesses but also in other areas like CMP and process control where you gained share in the past and you\u2019re looking to gain more share?","Gary Dickerson","So I think it was 2000 -- maybe it was 2013, we talked about the 2D -- the 3D NAND inflection and the business moving from LIFO intensive to edge and deposition intensive. And as I talked about earlier, we\u2019ve grown our memory revenue from 2013 about 5x, we\u2019ve increased share 7%. We\u2019re optimistic that the scaling is going to continue for 3D NAND. And we have some really tremendously enabling capabilities, the edge business for us is continuing to grow. Our conductor edge share is in a leadership position. We have new capabilities that we\u2019re bringing to market in NAND. So we're very optimistic on edge. We\u2019re optimistic in terms of deposition. CMP steps are growing in 3D NAND. So again overall I\u2019m very optimistic about the market and our position.","Michael Sullivan","And guys maybe I'll give an update on the Analyst Day. So we're looking at New York probably for the next one. I\u2019ve got a venue that\u2019s on hold. What we haven\u2019t finalized is the date. And I\u2019ve really got two choices that we\u2019re thinking about. One is we squeeze it in before the end of the year. What I\u2019m thinking about is if we do that, we\u2019re going to give a long term outlook that sounds a lot like what we did at SEMICON and AI Design Forum. The other choice is to save the meeting for next year. If we do that, what we\u2019ll be able to do is give you some updates on some of the products that we've been alluding to and also some of the initiatives that Gary has been describing, which might be a benefit. So if you ask me from where we sit here, I am leaning to next year and what we need to do is make a final determination and then send you a calendar notice. So I promise to do that, Patrick. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Joseph Moore","I have a question on the three-year outlook. We expect that the WFE number for FY\u201920 was $45 billion it\u2019s not $50 billion. What\u2019s the rationale for the change, what\u2019s changed since you gave the $45 billion number? And then can you talk a little bit about you maintaining the gross margin guidance with some mix shift with display lower and services higher. What\u2019s the impact of that mix shift? Thank you.","Dan Durn","As we take a step back and just look at where we sit relative to what was communicated at the last Analyst Day just in terms of what the new normal is. 2017 was high 40s from a WFE standpoint. We talk about \u201918 and \u201819 combined exceeding $100 billion. And so I think there is visibility on three nice proof points that get us to an industry that's larger than what was originally contemplated when we first went out with our long-term model. So we feel pretty good about $50 billion being the new norm in the industry going forward. And the second part of your question?","Joseph Moore","Just the gross margin impact of mix shift with the services, foundry and display\u2026","Dan Durn","So the gross margins of our business, while we don't disclose what they are, in order our semi business, our display business and our service business. And you rightfully point out as display is falling short of the target that was originally contemplated by 2020. That shortfall gets made up by our services business, creates a natural headwind in the business. And the management team is working hard on a number of fronts to drive gross margins in our execution to deliver on our shareholder commitments. And so it's just a lot of hard work that underpins the journey we've been on. And the Company has made great progress on this in the last four or five years where our gross margins are up 500 basis points. So we feel good about the journey ahead.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from West Twigg of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","West Twigg","I wanted to ask about cobalt adoption. You\u2019ve detailed it a couple of months ago, just wondering if you could comment on the traction you\u2019re seeing. And are customers successfully integrating it, or do you see any yield risk. And I think you said there was around $500 million opportunity of 7-nanometer. How far into that opportunity do you think you will get in 2019 based on the current customer activity?","Dan Durn","So we see cobalt continuing to be adopted over the next three, four years. Just for reference, one layer of cobalt adds about $70 million incremental business. So from where we\u2019re at right now, we continue to see adoption. It\u2019s probably in $250 million $300 million range over the next few years in terms of incremental business.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks Wes. Operator, I think we got time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Your line is now open.","Edwin Mok","On the prepared remarks, you guys talk about patterning, you guys have growing a patterning business and potentially adding $1 billion over the next five years. And you when we talk to investors, some of them are worried that you might actually reduce the patterning TAM. So is this possible, can you guys slide maybe some examples of why you think your patterning business didn\u2019t grow? Is it driven by share gain, new process, new architecture, et cetera?","Dan Durn","We have a number of strong products in the patterning market, the Sym3 and Selectra, the CMP business is also growing as more patterning steps are adopted. We have new deposition capabilities. So our overall market as you talked about grew a billion dollars over the last two years. We have a lot of confidence and line of sight to additional billion dollars over the next two years. So if you look at the market overall, about 50% is memory. Certainly, our share is growing a significant amount. You have trailing geometries about 25%. 25% is leading foundry and logic. And we see in the foundry logic significant traction. If we look at our share of patterning in 5-nanometer and our overall TAM 5 versus 7 goes up something like 25%, our positional share in 5 will also go up, especially in patterning.","So as multi-patterning gets further adopted and EUV steps are adopted, all of that is incrementally positive for Applied. EUV steps are replacing positions that Applied really isn\u2019t present today; so both of those areas, the growth in EUV, the growth in multi-patterning are positive for applied. And the other thing I would say relative to patterning. There are really to major areas of focus; one is shrinking features; but the other one is placing features in the right position. And if you look from an overall industry perspective, this pattern placement or alignment is a big challenge for customers. So we have a very good position as some of these new processes are adopted and certainly we have good line of sight to the future technology node. So for applied EUV is positive, our positions are positive and we have good line of sight to that additional growth.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks Edwin for your question. And Dan, would you like to add anything in closing.","Dan Durn","Thanks Mike. To me it comes down to three things. First, our markets and in particular company what we continue to see going forward, our business is going to be sustainably larger. It's more diverse, less volatile, less cyclical than it's been in the past. Couple of proof points we look at. In my intro talked about how we can now do the same level of earnings in a single quarter that we used to do in a full year a short while ago.","Something else to think about; even with the adjustments and spend that our customers have made this year, the lowest quarter of EPS in 2018 will be higher than any quarter in 2017, which was an all-time record for the Company; second, 2019, we see continued strength. The more we talk to both customers and others in the tech ecosystem, the more we believe. We\u2019re on the beginning of a powerful new wave. Applied Materials is on the critical path. Those trends depend on what Applied does best. Third, 2020 financial model, on track to exceed the targets we have out there. What it also says behind the scenes, we\u2019re building a pipeline, strong pipeline of new products, new innovations, new opportunities that set us up extremely well in the years beyond. As Gary said, we\u2019ve never been better positioned as a company than we are today.","Lastly, Citigroup conference is coming up in a few weeks. Look forward to seeing many of you there. And just let us know if you have any questions. We want to be helpful we\u2019re here to help, just let us know. ","With that, Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, great. Thanks Dan. And we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m Mike Sullivan, Head of Investor Relations at Applied Materials. We appreciate you joining us for our second quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied\u2019s current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions, and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied\u2019s most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s estimates, projections and assumptions as of May 17, 2018, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them.","Today\u2019s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today\u2019s earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. On Tuesday morning, July 10th, Applied Materials is sponsoring technology briefing during SEMICON West in San Francisco. Please save the date and stay tuned for additional details.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike. Applied\u2019s performance in the second fiscal quarter was another all-time record for the Company, with revenue up 29% from the same period last year. I\u2019d like to congratulate and thank our employees around the world for these outstanding results. Across the Company, we have tremendous momentum. Applied has broad exposure to major technology trends and is playing a larger more valuable role in the electronics ecosystem. All three of our major business segments semiconductor display and service remain on track to deliver strong double-digit growth in fiscal 2018.","In today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll provide our perspective on how the major trends driving our markets are evolving. I\u2019ll outline our strategy and how we are translating our broad portfolio of products and capabilities into sustainable growth for Applied, then Dan will provide more details about our financial performance and outlook.","During this past quarter, there have been some puts and takes in our customers\u2019 near-term investment plans. Smartphone sales have been below expectations, particularly for high-end models, and in response, both semiconductor and display suppliers have made adjustments to their capacity planning. We view the current investment levels as rational and disciplined, particularly in the memory market. We therefore believe a healthy balance of supply and demand will be maintained.","Smartphones remain a key long-term driver of both technology and capacity. In many ways, smartphones are the ultimate edge device. And as handset makers add more functions and features to their products, we see the content per box continuing to grow. For example, recent forecast from our customers indicate that average yearly growth in mobility content over the next three years will be around 35% for NAND and 20% for DRAM. In contrast to the weakness in smartphone unit sales we have seen in the first part of this year, there is evidence that emerging drivers of industry growth are picking up pace. The Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence will disrupt and transform virtually every industry and area of the economy over the next decade.","While we are only at the very beginning of the buildout of the AI, big data era, we are already starting to see the positive impact on our markets. In just the past six months, cloud service providers have increased their capital investments significantly. Looking at the financial reports from the top seven cloud service providers, we see their CapEx up around 40% this year versus previous expectations of about 30%. Also, data center real estate investments made by those companies in 2017 were up more than 250% compared to 2016, which we view as a positive leading indicator of growth.","Data centers are already becoming a much larger consumer of silicon. For example, the market for server DRAM is currently growing about 75% faster than mobile DRAM, which means it could become the largest segment of the DRAM market in the next three to five years. In addition, the architecture war for AI leadership is heating up with a steady stream of new, high-performance computing hardware coming to market. At both the server and chip level, we see a major shift from general-purpose computing to new hardware architectures that are customized for specific computing tasks or workloads. This significant technology inflection is fueling new investments in hardware design and new silicon devices, which in turn are driving significant innovation throughout the ecosystem.","I\u2019ll now translate these end market trends into an outlook for Applied\u2019s served markets. As I mentioned, we are seeing extremely disciplined investment by our memory customers, which we believe bodes well for healthy market dynamics. In line with our previous forecast, NAND bit demand is expected to grow at about 40% this year. While we have reduced our expectations for NAND investments in 2018, we still see spending being similar to last year\u2019s high levels.","Our outlook for DRAM investments has strengthened as customers invest in capacity and technology to meet growing demand for high-performance DRAM used in data centers. We expect this year\u2019s combined investments by foundry and logic customers to be similar to 2017, and we anticipate the spending will be split relatively evenly between leading-edge and trailing geometries to serve growing IoT and automotive applications. We also continue to see a steady ramp of spending in China by both multinational and domestic manufacturers, in line with our prior assumptions.","Taking all of these factors into account, we maintain our view that combined wafer fab equipment investments in 2018 and 2019 could be around $100 billion. In display, investments in large substrate Gen 10.5 TV capacity remain strong. Adoption of OLED screens in mobile and the ramp of manufacturing capacity are slower than previously expected, primarily due to weakness in high-end smartphone sales. We view OLED as a compelling technology and the leading handset makers are committed to making the transition over time. Compared to LCD, OLED offers significant performance and power advantages, as well as lower cost and high volume production. In addition, next generation flexible OLED will enable new form factors such as curved and ultimately foldable screens.","Applied Materials\u2019 vision is to make possible the technology shaping the future. And we have aligned our investments, organization and operating systems to realize this vision. In many ways, it is the breadth of our capabilities and product portfolio that sets us apart. We have the broadest exposure to industry trends and our business is well-balanced across a variety of markets and market segments. In addition, as the industry roadmaps become increasingly challenging, material solutions are more critical to deliver the needed improvements in power, performance area and costs for next generation devices.","Our ability to address these complex challenges with innovative approaches to materials creation, materials removal and materials modification is becoming increasingly valuable. We also have unique technologies like e-beam to measure, understand and inspect new materials and structures. We are using our breadth to help customers accelerate their roadmaps. Shortening the time it takes to bring new devices to market is incredibly valuable, resulting in strong customer pool for material solutions that go beyond traditional unit process tools. We are excited about our pipeline and will share more insights into these capabilities later this year.","In semiconductor, the strength of our technology portfolio has enabled us to outperform the market for six consecutive years. Based on our expanding opportunities and the traction of our new products, we expect to grow faster than the market again this year. With our R&D priorities aligned to our customers\u2019 evolving requirements, it is clear that advancing the industry roadmap is going to require a combination of new device architectures including 3D structures and advanced packaging, new materials, and new ways to shrink chip geometries that address both resolution and placement.","There is significant innovation taking place in all three of these areas, and that creates great opportunities for Applied. Even in shrink, our opportunity is growing, regardless of the pace of EUV lithography adoption. The reasons for this include self aligned multi-patterning techniques SADP and SAQP which are needed in conjunction with EUV lithography to drive the resolution roadmap and new materials enabled patterning approaches which are being developed as the primary solution for placement errors. Placement errors or the vertical alignment between the layers of a device can have a significant impact on device performance and reliability.","Beyond equipment, we continue to invest in new service products and organizational capabilities to create value for our customers. Our service business delivered all-time record performance this quarter with revenues up 30% relative to the same period last year. Over the longer term, we are confident that we can sustain annual service growth of at least 15%, driven by a growing installed base, a larger portion of those tools under long-term service agreements, and new service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize operating costs.","In display, since 2012, we\u2019ve grown revenues at an average rate of 25% per year and in 2018, we remain on track to grow by more than 30%. Based on recent revisions to timing of customers\u2019 OLED plans, our early view of 2019 is that our revenue will be lower than this year, although still nicely up from 2017. Overall, we maintain a positive outlook for the business as unique, long-term growth driver for Applied.","Before I turn the call over to Dan, I\u2019ll quickly summarize. While we\u2019ve seen some recent changes in customers\u2019 near-term investment plans, our markets remain strong and healthy with long-term demand drivers firmly in place. We maintain our view that wafer fab equipment spending for 2018 and 2019 combined could be $100 billion. Applied is outperforming our served markets. And in fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver strong double-digit growth in semi, display and services. As we look ahead, we see emerging technology trends that play to Applied\u2019s breadth. And we are excited about our expanding role, bringing new devices to market.","Now, Dan will give his perspective on our performance and outlook.","Dan Durn","Thanks, Gary.","In Q2, Applied set new performance records across a variety of operating and financial metrics. Our manufacturing and operations teams shipped a record number of 300 millimeter systems while hitting key goals for quality and on-time delivery. Company revenue was an all-time high, up 29% year-over-year. Our semi equipment and services businesses both set revenue records, and we exceeded our outlook in display. We maintained strong gross margins even as our service, and display businesses outgrew semi.","We grew non-GAAP operating profit by 40% year-over-year to $1.38 billion a new record. And we continue to become more efficient. We reduced our non-GAAP OpEx to sales ratio to 16.6%, the lowest in our history. And we did this by growing, not cutting. In fact, we are investing more in R&D than at any time in our history, to support our customers with new materials and innovative solutions. This makes Applied a uniquely valuable partner in driving the roadmap for continued high performance, low power and low cost. We will continue to invest with discipline and be laser focused on improving our execution and financial results.","I believe Applied\u2019s strong performance is also attributable to better industry dynamics. We see growing evidence that our markets are larger and less variable. We expect strong semiconductor equipment spending in 2018 and 2019, despite weakness in the high-end segment of the smartphone market, which is still the single biggest driver of semiconductor revenue. In the past, weakness within the largest end-product category might have caused a significant correction, particularly in memory. But Applied\u2019s results and outlook remains strong.","This outcome reinforces our belief in three positive factors. One, there are more demand drivers than ever before. Today the PC market is growing. Smartphones comes with wide range of price points to suite more consumers around the world and the new data economy is just beginning to take shape. Gary mentioned the strength in data center leading indicator for us. I personally believe, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence are business-critical, not consumer discretionary. Second capital intensity is higher. And third, our customers are healthy and adding capacity in a disciplined manner to meet demand where it is needed the most. In fact, while high-end smartphone units were weaker than expected, lower NAND pricing is creating additional demand for solid-state drives. In a world where data grows exponentially, it will take many years for our customers to convert the storage market from magnetic technology to semiconductors.","In this environment, Applied\u2019s breadth is a unique advantage. In semiconductor systems, Gary described how we are combining our technologies to help customers in new ways. You\u2019ll see more evidence of this in the months ahead. Applied is strong across memory, foundry and logic. And we are growing in memory where our leadership products are being used to improve performance and reduce power consumption. Technologies like high-k\/metal gate were pioneered in the logic market and are now being adopted in DRAM. Many of our new multi-patterning wins are also in DRAM.","Today, we are also growing our semi business beyond the opportunity set of the most advanced logic and memory nodes. Our 200 millimeter systems and our trailing node 300 millimeter systems served many hundreds of end customers in diverse industries such as automotive and industrial. Our 200 millimeter systems revenue should be up over 20% this year. In fact, we are now building brand-new systems to keep up with demand for the billions of sensors and other low-cost devices needed in the Internet of Things, advanced automotive applications, and Industry 4.0. These systems shipments are also helping us diversifying service, which gives us growth, consistent revenue and excellent cash flow. And Applied has a unique opportunity in display. As Gary discussed, while the transition to OLED smartphones will take some additional time, our overall display business is diverse and remains very strong.","As a company, we\u2019ve never had such a broad set of growth drivers, and we have more in the pipeline. As a result, our fiscal year revenue could be up by more than 20% in 2018 and our non-GAAP EPS could be up over 40%. We are well on track to our goal of achieving over $5 in non-GAAP EPS by 2020.","In short, we have strong conviction in our markets, our strategy, our technology pipeline, and our opportunity to deliver growth over the long run, even when equity markets are volatile in the short run.","Consistent with our convection, we used $2.5 billion during the quarter to repurchase 44 million shares of our stock or about 4% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the period. Over the past four quarters, our buybacks were equivalent to 7% of the shares outstanding. At the same time, we\u2019ve maintained a very strong balance sheet. We plan to increase our CapEx by about $400 million this year. The majority of the increase will be used to expand our R&D capabilities and manufacturing capacity.","Now, a comment on our financial execution in Q2. We delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in both revenue and non-GAAP EPS, which was $1.22 or $1.19 minus the benefit of a lower tax rate share count. On a year-over-year non-GAAP basis, we increased gross margin by 40 basis points, increased operating margin by 240 basis points, and grew EPS by 54%.","Turning to the segments. We delivered record revenue and operating profit in both semi equipment and services. We grew semi equipment revenue by 25% year-over-year. Services revenue was up 30% and above our expectation, driven by strong spare parts demand along with new long-term service agreements and renewals. In display, we grew revenue by 53% year-over-year and grew non-GAAP operating margin by 620 basis points year-over-year. We expect display revenue to be higher in our second half. Thanks to our balanced exposure to inflections in both the TV and mobile markets.","Now, I\u2019ll share our business outlook for Q3 as compared to the same period last year. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $4.33 billion to $4.53 billion. The midpoint would be up by about 18% year-over-year. We expect semiconductor systems revenue to grow about 7%. Our services revenue should increase by about 23%. Our display revenue should grow by about 75%. Our non-GAAP gross margins should be around 46.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $770 million, plus or minus $10 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.17, plus or minus $0.04. The midpoint of the range is up nearly 36%.","Finally, I will add some additional color to help you with your models for the full fiscal year in which overall company revenue could be up around 22%. The following four metrics are likely to be approximately flat sequentially from Q3 to Q4, services revenue, display revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP OpEx; and our semiconductor systems revenue is likely to be up sequentially in Q4.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Dan.","Now, to help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please poll the operator and we\u2019ll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let\u2019s please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, question for me is considering the weakness you are seeing in the high-end smartphone side, as your outlook for total WFE low double-digit growth in calendar \u201818 changed, could you discuss that? And then, how should we think about the $100 billion combined WFE outlook that you provided? Is that guide or just more reflective of your view that spending will remain sustainable -- strong into next year?","Dan Durn","I think, it\u2019s a reflection of our conviction in our end markets and sustainably strong. We feel really good about the end markets, like Gary said $100 billion in 2018 and 2019, and we are seeing strength across all device types. The markets are more balanced today than they\u2019ve probably ever been. 2017, was a very strong year. 2018 will be up over \u201817, and we see the fundamentals into \u201819 being strong. So, we still feel good about the markets, the performance and the outlook into 2019.","Operator","Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citigroup.","Atif Malik","Can you talk about the mix of LCD versus OLED displays in the reported quarter? And with expectations for display being down in 2019, are you expecting the TV market to be down, or is it more OLED?","Gary Dickerson","So, let me give some color on display overall. Display is a really good adjacent market for Applied. We averaged 25% growth, annual growth between 2012 and 2017. And we are still on track to greater than 30% revenue growth in 2018. Based on the customer plans our view of 2019 is for revenue to be down around 15% or 20%. When we look at mobile and TV, in \u201818, we see investment balance between mobile and TV; \u201819, more weighted towards TV. And in TV, the adoption of larger screens is driving the market. If you look at a Gen 10.5 factory versus a Gen 8.5 factory, you can produce eight 65-inch televisions versus three 65-inch televisions. So, it\u2019s really compelling value proposition there. We are still tracking 13 Gen 10.5 projects. There is a long lead time for these factories. And customers are still on track with these investments.","In OLED it is slower than we previously expected. We are still tracking 23 fabs that timing has extended out from around 2021 to 2023. But the transitioned OLED display is still compelling and leading handset makers are still committed to make the transition. If you look at rigid OLED, you have better performance, better form factor, lower cost, entitlement, and high volume manufacturing, and the ability to go to flexible OLED for curved and eventually foldable screens. So, we have had great performance in growth in display over the last few years. With future technology inflections, our pipeline of new capabilities, we continue to see display as a really good growth opportunity for Applied.","Operator","Our next question is from Pierre Ferragu with Newstreet Research.","Pierre Ferragu","Gary, you mentioned in your prepared remarks how the industry has become disciplined in the way it\u2019s managing its investments. And I think maybe you could elaborate on that and tell us what happened in the first quarter of the year. So, demand in smartphones came in weaker than expected. We are like in a weak smartphone environment; that\u2019s fairly new. So, my question is this new discipline, does that mean that your clients have been able to adapt their plans very rapidly and adapted plans already? Although that actually means that the unit growth of smartphone as a driver for the industry as a whole is now so small and lost into other drivers like content increase and other markets like data center, and this is that actually -- that\u2019s not a moving part that really affects investment plans in today\u2019s world?","Dan Durn","So, if we take a look at the memory markets as an illustration of the point around discipline, we take a look at the demand. End-market demand is strong. The macro drivers, we keep talking about artificial intelligence, data economy or real, they are playing out and it\u2019s driving demand for silicon. We see that demand in the memory market. Customers are incredibly healthy. They are investing a lot, but they\u2019re also making a lot. In fact, WFE as a percent of EBITDA is down 50% from 2012 to today. And the environment is characterized by demand led investments. The market is showing incredible discipline.","In DRAM 2017, supply bit growth was about 20%. Demand bit growth in 2017 was slightly more than that. In 2018, we expect supply and demand in the DRAM market to be balanced at about 20% growth each. In NAND, it\u2019s a similar story. In 2017, supply bit growth was about 30% to 35%. In 2017, demand bit growth was about 35% to 40%. In 2018, again, we see a balanced market from a supply-demand perspective, both at about 40%. When we look at what\u2019s happening in China, we are seeing modest and disciplined growth in China. China is emerging as a spender, their strategic intent is clear and the financial resources they have are clear. And based on our dialogue, we think the expectations with those customers are realistic. They are being pragmatic. Capacity additions to date are modest. And when we take all of this into account, we have confidence in this region in the long run.","So, across multiple markets, multiple geographies, we are seeing a very disciplined environment play out. And as we take a step back from that environment, 2017 was a great year in WFE. 2018 will be up over 2017. As Gary said, could be $100 billion between \u201818 and \u201819. So, we are seeing strength across all device types, customers are healthy, and they are acting in a disciplined manner.","Operator","Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for the commentary on memory. So, you see a balanced supply demand outlook for DRAM. I think, industry capacity entering this year was about 1.1 million wafer starts per month but as you guys know, the DRAM suppliers are losing effective capacity like every time they do a technology migration I think something to the tune of like 15% capacity loss. And then bit per wafer is also going down every time they do technology migration. So, given what you\u2019re seeing, what you think we end the year as it relates to total DRAM capacity? Thank you. ","Dan Durn","Thanks for the question. If we go back to 2016, it was 1.1 million wafer starts per month and probably a handful of years before that it was 1.1 million wafer starts per month. In 2017, because of exactly the dynamic you talked about, which is we\u2019re getting big growth out of shrinks and the shrinks are happening at a less frequent interval, we saw more capacity adds in the DRAM market. So, it rounded to 1.2 million wafer starts per month, exiting 2017. I think, it\u2019s too early to call where we end up in 2018, but we definitely see customers struggling to drive bit growth from shrinks alone, factory output when you shrink because the process is more complex, goes down and Greenfield adds are being just added to keep the supply demand and balance driving about a 20% bit supply growth in line with bit demand growth. So, too early to call it but it still looks like a healthy market, acting with discipline.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. One thing I would like to add is that in DRAM, we\u2019re going to see very strong growth in revenue in 2018, much faster than what we project for the market. The devices are changing to become more logic like in the periphery, similar to 28-nanometer foundry steps. We\u2019re also gaining and patterning the wins where we never had positions. So, especially in DRAM, we see very strong growth for Applied in 2018 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you our next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.","Romit Shah","If I heard you correctly, Dan, you guys are reiterating your 2020 target, but at the same time you\u2019re lowering your outlook for display. I mean, relative to what the street is forecasting, it looks like it\u2019s about $600 million swing in display revenue guidance relative to forecast. So, can you help us reconcile reiteration of that 2020 target versus the lower guidance for display? Thank you. ","Dan Durn","So, look, the business is performing extremely well. Q2 was a record quarter; 2018 is going to be a record year for the company. We\u2019ve got more pipeline opportunities, new products that are to be introduced, we\u2019re going to be announcing them in the near term. The business is performing well and we\u2019re driving good performance. We are well on our track to hitting over $5 of EPS by 2020. How that profiles across the business? We\u2019re not going to update the long-term model on this call; we\u2019ll do that at our analyst day later this fall. But at the core is a business that\u2019s performing well with a lot of conviction around hitting that long-term target of $5 of EPS, over $5 of EPS by 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","I wanted to follow up on this $100 billion over this year and in next year. And it sounded that base line for this year that you guys are talking about is like in the low 50s because you\u2019re saying up double digits off of like a $47 billion number. So, that would imply that it\u2019s down like 5 billion to $6 billion next year. I know that that\u2019s not guidance and you could just easily probably raise it to 105 or something like that. But I\u2019m a little surprised that the number is not a bit higher because of what\u2019s happening in China. So, I guess my question is, A, like, what\u2019s going to decline next year if that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to imply? And B, can you talk about the ramp in China, now we are shipping into three projects in China? And Gary, how you think that those ramp through this year and next year?","Dan Durn","So, a couple of things. First of all, thanks for the question. I don\u2019t think that we are providing specific guide on 2018 and 2019. It\u2019s an indication of strength and follow through. And at the core of that, we feel really good about the end markets. Like Gary said, $100 billion \u201818 and \u201819, we see strengths across all device types. It\u2019s too early to tell today exactly how 2018 profiles first half, second half, full year and how 2019 profiles. But, we\u2019ve got a lot of convection and confidence heading into 2019. There is a number of reasons at the core of it. We are talking about macro trends, they are real, they are having a real impact. Demand for silicon is up. Second, capital intensity is up across the board, and that\u2019s all device types. Markets are balanced. We are seeing strength across all four device types.","We take a step back, NAND has gotten a lot of publicity of late. When we end 2018, we are going to see something very similar in the NAND market to 2017, which was an all-time high, taking a step back from the near-term noise. This is an incredibly strong market. Customers, again, for customers continue to be healthy; they are profitable; they are behaving in a disciplined manner. And again, we are seeing the right kind of signals out of China that indicate long-term stability health and being a meaningful driver of growth going forward. So, too early to call exactly how it profiles, but we\u2019ve got a lot of strength and conviction about how the outlook and fundamentals look into 2018.","Gary Dickerson","Tim, I can give maybe a little bit more color also on China. So, 2018 is going to be a great year for Applied in China. We have very strong position in semi, service, display, and we anticipate that we are going to grow faster than the market there. \u201818 is pretty balanced between domestic and global companies from a revenue perspective. Domestic China is higher on foundry logic; global is higher on memory. But overall, we are going to have a great year there in 2018. As Dan said, we believe the investments are rational and will continue. And this is long-term, a great growth opportunity for Applied.","Operator","Our next question is from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","My first question is regarding the comment that you had on 2018, 2019 WFE at $100 billion plus. If I look at the trends for last several years, \u201814, \u201815 WFE combined was $70 billion; \u201816 \u201817 was 90; \u201818, \u201819, you are saying 100. What do you think like going forward 2021? Should we expect the continued growth in WFE as well and maybe like \u201818 to \u201819 could be down but \u201820 \u201821 should be up from there?","Gary Dickerson","If we go back to 2000 when 300 millimeter wafers were introduced, the industry peaked at a capital intensity or WFE intensity of about 17% of overall industry revenues. And as you work to 300 millimeter systems into the mix, it drove a whole host of efficiencies. That wasn\u2019t more -- just more output per factory; it\u2019s the way the factories were run, factory automation systems. There was a whole host of efficiencies that were driven into the industry. And then, in about maybe 2011, I think it was the industry bottomed at about 7% of WFE intensity. And it\u2019s been on the -- 13% -- 2013 and it\u2019s been on the rise ever since then.","But, if we take a look at it today, 2017, it was about 12%. I think, there\u2019s arguments to say that it could go higher based on a lot of complexity we see across the device types and capital intensity increasing. But, if you just keep it at 12% and you think about where the overall semiconductor industry has the potential to grow to, even modest growth rates to 2025 mean that it could be a $650 billion, $700 billion, $750 billion industry. And if you apply your 12% ratio to that aggregate industry revenue, you get to WFE numbers that are significantly north of where we are today. So, we believe in the long-term trends that we\u2019re seeing. We believe that semiconductors are on the critical path of enabling those trends. We believe that the industry is getting more complex and hence more capital-intensive. And we think that we\u2019ve got more opportunities in front of us than we have in the rear view mirror. So we feel good about where this has the potential to go. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I think, historically, you guys have been very good at guiding the services business. I think for the past two quarters, you\u2019ve come in significantly above your guide. I\u2019m just wondering, has anything changed in the business from a fundamental standpoint? And how should we think about sustainability of growth into the back half of the year and into 2019?","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Toshiya. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing any fundamental changes in the business. We think that this is a great business for us. We feel good about where it\u2019s headed. It\u2019s a form of less volatile revenue growth. It\u2019s more stable driver of cash flow over time. And the management team that is operating this business in a very disciplined and focused way. We\u2019ve seen growth above our long-term advertise growth rate of compounded 15% per year between now and 2020. At the analyst day, we\u2019ll revise that long-term forecast. But the team is executing well. And growth is really a function of three things in this business. Our installed base, we\u2019ve got the largest installed base in the industry; complexity is going up; service opportunity on a 300 millimeter tool is 4x that of a 200 millimeter tool. So, the opportunity continues to grow over time as we continue to grow and ramp our semiconductor equipment business. And then, the team has done a great job of driving service agreements with our customers. This is about the performance, performance of the machine, output, yield capabilities. It drives better outcomes for our customers, better outcomes for us. And that partnership is reflected in the numbers that we\u2019re driving. So, nothing fundamentally is changed. We\u2019ve seen high utilizations probably driving higher parts uptake than we\u2019ve seen maybe historically at lower levels of utilization throughout the industry. But, it\u2019s just a disciplined focused management team, driving hard at producing good results.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Just curious, when I look at your Q3 outlook, it sounds semis would be down sequentially, which is somewhat different than the up sequential sort of guidance that we saw from some of your peers. I know, these things don\u2019t always line up exactly. But, I just wanted to hear your views on why there would be that kind of difference in terms of sequential growth rates in the semiconductor business?","Gary Dickerson","Absolutely. And I agree, this stuff doesn\u2019t line up perfectly, different companies would profile differently. When we take a step back, 2017 was a great year for WFE, 48 billion. In 2018, it\u2019s going to be up over \u201817. We\u2019re going to show strong double-digit growth in each of our respective businesses. First half in \u201818 is strong. And with inventory rebalance that we\u2019re seeing from smartphones, we\u2019re going to see a sequential dip in the Q3. But from our guidance into Q4, you can see that it recovers nicely into Q4. Fundamentals, we\u2019ve talked about it on the call. Fundamentals in the 2019 look good for us. 2018 and 2019, as a combined two-year period are going to be over a $100 billion. It\u2019s going to be a good year. And so, we like the fundamentals and we like where the business is going. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much to read into any one quarter over this period of performance.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.","Krish Sankar","I had a question on display, a two-part question. One is, is it a margin differential between selling to LCD and OLED customers within display? And if display revenue is down 15% next year, if all of the segments are similar, how should op margins look like?","Gary Dickerson","We don\u2019t see any really any difference in the margins between the OLED and TV customers. And then, operating margins, Dan, do you want to cover that one?","Dan Durn","The team is doing a good job driving the operating margins. We\u2019ve talked about the long-term trajectory to the high 20s. And on our analyst day, we will update that long term forecast, but the is doing a good job driving the operating margins.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel.","Patrick Ho","Gary, maybe specifically for you. You talked about DRAM and the higher capital intensity trends that you\u2019re seeing there for equipment overall; there\u2019s more patterning tests and even new materials being used. Can you maybe go a little more in color in terms of where that\u2019s benefitted your leadership segment as well as where you believe Applied has gained share in the DRAM segment?","Gary Dickerson","So, DRAM, as I said earlier is really going to grow a significant amount for us in 2018. And we could, if you look at the 2013 versus \u201818 have revenue growth around 5X in terms of our DRAM revenue. So, really a significant growth. And as I mentioned before on the call, in the past, we\u2019ve really had strength in one segment, which was foundry that was over 20%. All the other segments were 15% or lower. We\u2019ve increased our share of DRAM, a huge amount. And one thing that\u2019s happening from a device standpoint, they want faster input output to the chip. In the periphery area, you\u2019re starting to see more logic like steps. And as you said, Patrick that benefits all of our products that we normally sell into logic, FE [ph ]PVD implant, thermal, CMP, all of those areas are now seeing demand in DRAM and especially if there\u2019s Greenfield activity taking place that puts us in a great position relative to our overall share of the DRAM spending. We are also making gains in patterning in DRAM. New wins where we never had position really strong gains with Sym3. So, those are the areas where we are seeing the fastest growth.","Operator","And our next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok","My question is actually on the trading at [ph] foundry logic, I think you guys mentioned 200 millimeters, up 20% this year. And I think historically that has not been really a big part of the business that we have heard more and more from equipment companies that that has become a really meaningful part of that business. So, what changed in the trading actually that is driving this growth or become a bigger piece? Customer historically buy old tools or buy older design tool, our customers like adopting the latest and greatest hardware in the trading [ph] as 200 millimeter now?","Dan Durn","So, the changing buying patterns we have seen in customers has really been unfolding over the better part of the decade. If you would go back a decade ago, you would\u2019ve seen 90% of the WFE in the foundry space on the leading edge, 10% on the trailing edge. Over time, that\u2019s evolved to 80-20, 60-40 and this year we see it evolving to 50:50. And I think at the core of that is that more diversified spending is proliferation of edge devices as part of the Internet of Things, requires a different power performance envelope. And you see our estimates, call it for 28 nanometer peak capacity and initially we called peak capacity at 28 nanometers 330,000 wafer starts a month, then it was 400,000, then it was 450,000 and now it\u2019s 500,000 wafer starts a month. So, you can see those peak capacities beginning to expand as edge devices proliferate and you need sensors and intelligence, on-board intelligence in those devices.","And so, we think it\u2019s really healthy to see this industry diversify geographically from a technology node perspective. We think it\u2019s healthy from a long-term industry perspective as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sidney Ho","A few months ago in an investor conference, Dan, you talked about the next downturn could be a WFE going to $40 billion, and that you can achieve EPS better than 2017. Can you walk us through that thought process behind that comment. And what would be the biggest risk to those assumptions?","Dan Durn","Sure. Thanks, Sidney. So, as you know from the prepared comments and the Q&A, certainly $40 billion WFE is not our view, but of course we plan for a wide variety of scenarios. So, if we walk through a scenario, say that\u2019s 40 billion WFE. Let\u2019s say our businesses is diverse. Services is more stable. It\u2019s growing well. And from Gary\u2019s comment, display will be down into 2019. And a 24% market share for lack of a better number, so 24% share in our equipment business, display down, services growing, you get revenue somewhere around $16 billion. And let\u2019s say, we keep OpEx in that difficult environment, we keep OpEx the same as this year, just probably a conservative assumption, but peg it to this year. Operating profit based on that revenue flow-through is something around 26.5%. And so, 2019 EPS in that scenario is nicely higher than where we were in 2017. So, while we model a lot of scenarios, it\u2019s not our current view. But, that\u2019s what a downside scenario could potentially look like.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Wong with Wells Fargo. ","David Wong","Looking at how the percent of your sales into China has been rapidly growing. I think, it was 25% in the most recent quarter. Do you have any view on what your sales growth into China might be in fiscal \u201819 and fiscal \u201820?","Gary Dickerson","Thanks for the question. China is definitely a very strong region for us if we look at our share in semi, display, service, it\u2019s one of the strongest regions. And as I said earlier, \u201818 is going to see significant growth for applied. We do see continued increasing investment in China as we move forward. We don\u2019t have any specific forecast on what that what that will look like, but we have been seeing increasing revenue from China and growth there over two years. We anticipate that to go forward. Now, we don\u2019t expect to see a hockey stick. If you look at the technology needed to participate in the leading-edge, there are still some gaps there. But, one of the things that we are also seeing is that the trailing geometries are growing, Dan just talked about that relative to demand. And certainly, that\u2019s an area where China is making a lot of investments. So, again, we see increased revenue there, increased demand going forward, and overall a great position for Applied.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Dan, I see you had the largest incremental increase in inventory is the largest sequential increase for a number of years. Could you please help us understand what is driving this increase and the mix between finished goods and components?","Dan Durn","Thanks, Mehdi. I think, the inventory increase is a function of two things. We\u2019ve got a growing business. And we think that business is going to continue to grow going forward. But probably most importantly is, as we have consciously brought up our inventory levels in support of our fast-growing services business in the different geographies that we\u2019re experiencing that growth to make sure we get the right kind of customer responsiveness and the right kind of customer satisfaction from a service business that\u2019s becoming increasingly important in and of itself but increasingly important with our customers. And so, it\u2019s a conscious effort to increase service levels in a way that supports that rapid growth.","Gary Dickerson","Operator, I think we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","It sounds like your view of WFE overall hasn\u2019t changed that much but you said NAND a little bit maybe lower than you thought, still up for the year and DRAM a little higher. I guess, what form has that lower NAND taken? Is that sort of existing projects that you have planned -- that you had seen and planned that you see are being deferred? Is it someone just saying we\u2019re going to spend the same amount of money but we\u2019re going to spend it on DRAM instead of NAND or is it just that the -- the year is just playing out a little bit differently than you thought and nothing is sort of identifiable change. So, what\u2019s the scenario that led to NAND being a little bit lower?","Dan Durn","Look, so, I don\u2019t think you can attribute it to any one single factor. And I think it gets back to what we were saying about disciplined behavior in the market with our customers to make sure we\u2019re constantly balancing supply-demand so that customers remain healthy and we can just continue with the demand-led investment environment. And so we think it\u2019s just customers responding in a very rational, disciplined way that reflects the reality of the current market. And look, we\u2019re very close with all of our customers. You hear our views on where we think this is headed in the 2019. So, we feel very, very good about where we sit and actually think the near-term behavior bodes well for the long-term health of the memory market as well as WFE in general.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.","Craig Ellis","Yes. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for all of the insight on the industry dynamics. I did want to however turn to a different issue and focus on a free cash -- or excuse me, a cash flow item. Share buyback was a 2.5 billion a quarter, so about 28% of the authorization that have been expanded three months ago. Dan, I was hoping you could just give us some sense for the way you\u2019re looking at executing on that program as we go forward, whether or it\u2019s going to be more opportunistic or if there\u2019s some calendar or periodic element to the way you would execute on the balance of the program?","Dan Durn","So, you can see the actions we\u2019ve taken. We\u2019ve got a view, our markets are strong. Our position within those respective markets is probably better today than it\u2019s ever been. Company is executing well and we\u2019re generating a lot of cash. We\u2019ve got a long-term track record of returning that cash to shareholders, and that\u2019s going to -- that will continue. In June, we pay our first $0.20 dividend. We repurchased 2.5 billion shares in the quarter, like you point out. And we\u2019re going to continue to be opportunistic in the market. While I won\u2019t commit 2.5 billion every quarter, we\u2019re going to continue to be opportunistic. When we don\u2019t feel like trading price of our stock reflects the intrinsic value of the company, we\u2019ll be in the market over time to return that cash to shareholders. And I think that general framing, that mindset, that outlook just reflects the strong confidence we have, confidence in our industry, in the business and our execution. And we\u2019re going to continue to look at dividend levels periodically over time, and as we grow our business, continue to maintain a strong track record of returning cash to shareholders. But, opportunistic approach going forward, like we\u2019ve always done.","Gary Dickerson","Dan, anything else you want to add before we go ahead and close up the call today?","Dan Durn","Yes, thanks, Mike. So, maybe a couple of quick thoughts that we can wrap up with. I think, I want to reiterate, Q2 is a record quarter. 2018 is going to be another record year for this Company. Company is executing well. We\u2019re driving top line growth. We\u2019re driving margin accretion. We\u2019re driving strong cash flow. And we\u2019re driving more resources into R&D to fuel our future growth.","Breadth, breadth is a major positive that sets us apart. In semis we\u2019re hitting new records. We are strong and strong across all device types. We\u2019ve got a growing pipeline. These new products, they are going to deliver high performance and low power to the market. And we are going to see some of those new products here in the very near future. And we are growing beyond semi. While display investments are shifting out in time, it\u2019s being offset by tremendous growth in our services business. The team has just done a fantastic job executing against that opportunity. And I guess, to Romit\u2019s earlier question, this is how we are offsetting that weakness in display and still well on track to earning over $5 a share in 2020. We have got strong conviction, strong conviction in our markets, in the pipeline, in the execution, and backing it up with strong capital allocation, $2.6 billion in Q2 alone.","And I guess, before we go, just look forward to seeing many of you at the following upcoming events. Gary and I are headed to Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference, first time for Applied; at the new AI conference for investors arranged by Newstreet Research; and at the Cowen, upcoming Cowen and BofA Merrill Lynch conferences. Thanks for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate it.","Gary Dickerson","Thank, Dan. And we would like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website by 5 p.m. Pacific Time. And we would like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we conclude our conference. You may all disconnect.

During the presentation, all participants will be in listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 16, 2013.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you, Kia, and good afternoon. Joining us on the call today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; Gary Dickerson, our Company\u2019s President; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Today we\u2019ll discuss the results for our second quarter ended April 28. Let me remind you that today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements including the Company\u2019s current view of its markets, industry trends, opportunities, growth strategies, share position, technology, cost structure, profitability and Q3 business outlook. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied and they should be interpreted in that line. Information concerning the risk factors is contained in our Company\u2019s SEC filings including our most recent Form 10-Q.","Today\u2019s call also includes non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today\u2019s earnings press release and in our quarterly financial highlights presentation, both of which are available on Investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that Applied will hold our 2013 Analyst Day in Santa Clara on Monday July 8, just prior to SEMICON West. Many of you have already signed up to join us and we look forward to seeing you there. If you like additional information about the events, please contact me using the number in today\u2019s earnings press release.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter.","Michael R. Splinter","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. In our second fiscal quarter, Applied Materials delivered earnings that exceeded the high-end of our outlook. We fulfilled request for accelerated delivery of orders from a number of our semiconductor and display customers, while carefully managing our spending.","At this point in the year 2013 is shaking up largely as we have expected. Demand for semiconductor equipment is healthy, utilization at our customers\u2019 factories is steadily increasing, and investment in display is strengthening. Across the company, we are building momentum for profitable growth. Over the past two quarters, we have implemented measures to reduce our overhead costs and have redeployed spending to product development and our customer facing technical teams. These changes are enabling us to strengthen customer collaborations and increased our product development philosophy.","We are focusing our R&D investments on key programs that support our strategic priority to increase our share in wafer fab equipment, while making targeted investments in display and other opportunities that expand our total available market. We see further opportunities to reduce our operating expenses and organizational complexity to improve operating margins at current revenue levels and provide significant earnings leverage as volumes increase.","I will discuss these opportunities later in the call. Major industry trends are expanding our served available market in place to our strengths in Precision Materials Engineering. We expect to grow our share of wafer fab equipment this year while winning key development tool at record positions that provide a foundation for additional share gains in 2014 and beyond. We are also building momentum in display. Customers are adding capacity and we are seeing stronger order growth. We are significantly increasing our share of the display PVD market, complementing our strong position in CVD.","In semiconductor, the mobility trend remains the biggest factor influencing industry growth. The global appetite for always on, always connected mobile devices continues to strengthen. And now the value of silicon being consumed by smartphones and tablets has surpassed that being used by PCs. Around 200 million smartphones and 35 million tablets shipped in the first calendar quarter of 2013. That\u2019s in line with expected annual growth rate of 35% for phones and 55% for tablets.","Demand for the advanced application of baseband processors used in smartphones and tablets is fueling investment by foundries as they add capacity at 28 nanometers, begin 20 nanometer pilot production and accelerate the development of 3D transistors.","Transistor performance is the key battleground for our foundry customers. In his latest earnings call, Morris Chang described how TSMC has differentiated offering in high-K metal gate delivers better performance for their customers\u2019 products. Applied\u2019s clear leadership in the transistor module enables us to help our customers solve their high value device performance challenges and we are earning share gains at the leading foundries.","The mobility trend also represents a tremendous demand driver for NAND Flash memory. With bit growth in the 40% to 50% range and supply and demand relatively well-balanced today, we believe NAND manufacturers will increase their investment levels in the second half.","As sales figures for the first quarter clearly indicate, the PC market is navigating some challenging times. And as a result, customers are reducing capital spending plans for logic. Consumption of mobile DRAM has surpassed PC DRAM for the first time. Manufacturers have been migrating capacity to mobile and with tightening supply, prices have been rising.","To meet near-term demand, we are seeing some incremental investment, primarily focused on technology conversions. We believe DRAM trends bode well for increased investment levels in the medium-term. While there have been some shifts in customers\u2019 investment plans towards mobility, we maintain our view that 2013 wafer fab equipment will be in the range of $27 billion to $30 billion, reaching the high-end of the range will require accelerated build-out of the 20-nanometer foundry node and a further uptick in memory investment.","Turning to display, we see increasing demand from emerging markets, as well as 50 inch and larger models becoming a more significant portion of global TV sales. This is driving healthy area growth, which we anticipate to be in excess of 10% for the year. The potential for undersupply in the second half is stimulating capacity investments.","We are receiving orders for new display factories in China, and expect this equipment to be installed in the fall. Demand for mobile devices and touchscreens remains robust and investment continues with focus on advanced technologies, including OLED. We\u2019re strengthening market conditions in our shared gains, we are beginning to demonstrate the potential of our display business.","In solar, equipment industry conditions remain challenging. We are significantly reducing our exposure to the current weakness in the market by substantially scaling back our investment. We expect our quarterly operating expenses for EES to be below $25 million exiting the fiscal year.","Overall, as we look to the second half of 2013, we see spending spread across the broader base of semiconductor customers. Memory investments look incrementally more positive and demand in display is strengthening. More importantly at Applied, we are building momentum towards profitable growth. We are focused on strategy execution and winning those critical tool selections that support share gains while in parallel making changes to the organization that will allow us to deliver stronger operating margins and increase our investment in attractive growth opportunities.","Before I hand the call over to Gary, I would like to officially welcome Bob Halliday to his first earnings call as Applied Materials\u2019 CFO. Bob brings a strong track record of results and a wealth of industry experience in this role. He is already proving to be an outstanding leader for our global finance team.","Now, let me hand the call over to Gary for additional comments about our growth initiatives. Gary?","Gary E. Dickerson","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. As Mike outlined global adoption of mobile devices drives growth in the electronics industry. It is also increasing the speed of innovation within the value chain. Our semiconductor and display customers are striving to provide consumers with more capable mobile products and this is accelerating changes in device technology that are enabled by the Applied Materials\u2019 core strength in precision materials engineering. All of this creates a great environment for us to execute our strategy and drive profitable growth.","Today, we are building momentum by strengthening our team and focusing our investments to deliver growth in revenue and operating profit. We are building momentum by increasing share and entering into earlier and deeper collaborations with our largest customers. We are leveraging our strength to help customers make major transistor and memory transition that will happen in 2014 and 2015. And we are building profitable growth in additional segments that will provide significant improvement in our overall operating margins.","In order to accelerate the execution of our strategic plans, we are strengthening our organization and business processes. We are aggressively managing our cost to drive improvement in operating margins and taking further steps to reduce overhead expenses. We are actively managing our product portfolio by focusing on our best opportunities and increasing funding for those programs that really moves the needle for our customers and for Applied.","In addition, we continue to operate our product development engine to improve our ability to define winning products and increase the velocity of our development process. ","Our customers are faced with increasingly complex device performance and the old challenges, as they transition to new device technology and new materials. This is driving significant pull from our largest foundry, logic and memory customers for earlier and deeper collaboration on our next generation products as they focus on accelerating technology development and technology transfer into high volume manufacturing. These broader and deeper collaboration span our current areas of precision materials engineering market leadership and additional market segments, where we have significant potential to grow share as future device technology is adapted.","Applied\u2019s position as the leader in enabling precision materials engineering technology is giving us insight into future device performance and yield problems that are critical for our customers. In our early engagements, we see an increase in atomic level customization of our precision films combined with enabling technologies, including precision materials modification, materials removal and interface engineering on Applied Materials platforms. This gives Applied a unique opportunity to solve some of our customers\u2019 challenges with new solutions that leverage our strong materials engineering technology portfolio.","Some emerging materials engineering examples include improving film stability and very high aspect ratio structures, film densification, material selectivity for deposition and etch and atomic level interface engineering to improve device performance and yield by preventing corrosion and metal oxide growth.","To support broader and deeper customer relationship, we are strengthening our technical teams in the field by moving key people into higher impact position and bringing new talent into the company. In semiconductor, key market inflections are growing our available market while creating opportunities for Applied to demonstrate leadership and win share.","as the foundries start their transitions to 20 nanometer technology, we see Applied serve the market opportunity growing approximately 25% relative to the 28 nanometer baseline. Our strongest positions are at the foundries. And as they focus our new transistor technology, this placed to our strength and provides a great platform for us to grow share with our leadership products.","The architectural advantages offered by our epi, thermal, metal deposition, CMP and implant product, combined with our ability to integrate these processes are enabling customers to solve major device performance and yield challenges associated with the move from oxynitride transistor scheme to a high-K metal gate glass devices.","In addition, we see increased urgency in the development of FinFET technology where the interplay between deposition, annealing and implant steps is even more important. When the FinFET inflection occurs, we expect our served markets to incrementally grow by 5% to 10% on top of the 25% increase during the 20 nanometer transition. Beyond our increasing opportunity in foundry and logic, we expect our served market to grow by about 25% on a wafer start basis as memory customers\u2019 transition from plainer NAND to the first generation 3D device technology.","We anticipate shipping production equipment for 3D NAND in the fourth quarter of 2013 for the initial ramp of these new devices, another market that has potential for profitable growth is CMP. We are seeing an increase in the number of CMP staff for leading edge device technology. We recently began shipments of new CMP technology that we anticipate will enable us to increase share starting this year and we\u2019ve already secured new positions with large foundry customers.","We are also building profitable growth in additional segments. Inspection represents a great opportunity for profitable growth, and we are focusing on segments of the market while we are strong and have differentiated technology. We are demonstrating solid momentum in wafer and inspection, and with recent wins at leading foundry and logic customers, we are very well positioned for share gains in 2013 and 2014.","In etch our strategy is to increase share and applications in foundry and memory where we have valuable and sustainable differentiations. In the past quarter, we received production orders for memory customers and one new development tool record positions that gives us momentum to deliver a significant improvement in etch financial performance.","In display, we have great momentum. We are increasing our market share and during the second quarter, we secured 100% of the CVD and PVD business for a new factory in China. As the market rebounds, we see the potential to book more than $800 million of orders this calendar year.","The structural changes we have made to our display organization during the downturn provide us with strong operating leverage as volumes increase. As the industry moves to new transistor technology and OLED from mobile applications in TV is becoming more process and material technology intensive. This plays to Applied strength in Precision Materials Engineering for large area application. In TV 4K resolution and increasing average screen sizes create a number of engineering and manufacturing challenges. Larger areas and smaller pixels make some uniformity and particle performance increasingly important.","Our CVD and PVD systems have clear architectural advantages in device performance and yield that enable us to deliver increased value to our customers. Applied has been the clear leader in CVD for many years. And now we are demonstrating excellent traction with our pivot PVD tool and expect to significantly grow our share in PVD in 2013 and beyond.","In summary, our semiconductor and display customers are in arrays to deliver differentiated products to gain share and mobility. This is driving a big push by customers to accelerate time to market of new devices and new materials. These inflections create a great opportunity for Applied to leverage our leadership in Precision Materials Engineering and earlier and deeper engagements with customers to solve their major device performance and yield challenges and drive profitable growth.","We are building momentum by strengthening the Applied team and focussing our investments to deliver growth and revenue and operating profit. We are very excited about the momentum we are building for profitable growth and we\u2019ll discuss our plans and opportunities in more detail at the Analyst Meeting on July 8.","Let me now hand the call over to Bob for further details on our performance. Bob?","Bob Halliday","Thanks, Gary. I look forward to working with everyone on the call again in my role as the CFO for Applied Materials. I\u2019ve been a part of the Applied team for over a year now, and I\u2019m extremely impressed by the depth of technology and talent we have across the company.","I was immediately impressed with Applied\u2019s ability to design and build great products. As a product company, there are three legs on the profitable growth stool. The first leg is the ability to design and build great products. Applied definitely has that ability. What also struck me was the economic power of these products.","Applied\u2019s integrated solutions combine superior hardware, chemistry, and process support. The economic value to customers can be great and the economic value of these strong products leveraged off of a common platform is also great for Applied Materials. The second leg of our strategy for profitable growth is the ability to solve customers\u2019 high value problems.","I have been increasingly impressed over the last year that our improved internal capability to learn and solve these problems. The increasing ability to understand customers\u2019 high value problems combined with our ability to design incredible products results in a more products that hit the market requirements. As I said before, products that hit the market requirements result in very good businesses for Applied Materials.","The third leg of our profitable growth strategy is our ability to fund growth and increase investor returns. We\u2019ve already taken number of actions in recent quarters to redirect spending to fund new product development and strengthen our technical marketing capabilities. These actions include steep reductions in solar spending, our gain integration synergies, the global workforce actions we announced in October and a reprioritization of our R&D projects. We are reinvesting that savings in product development to drive our growth.","Looking at our financials, R&D spending as a percentage of R&D plus G&A has increased from 53.3% in Q2 of last year to 57% in Q1 of 2013 and 58.5% in Q2 2013.","The next question is can we fund growth and increase our profitability at all levels of sales? In my first couple of months as CFO, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to examine each of our businesses in greater detail. And I see opportunities to lower our cost and improve our efficiency. I plan to review our detailed operating model in timeline with you at our Analyst Meeting in July.","At this time, I will share some initial perspectives on seven areas of our business.","First, in EES we have very aggressively reduced our losses. Our non-GAAP losses in Q2 decreased to $34 million and are down 40% from the same period last year, despite half of the revenue. We will continue to reduce our spending in losses.","Second, in display, Q2 non-GAAP operating margins more than doubled from the prior year to 16.5% on slightly lower net sales, our display business has a very attractive business model and managed to stay profitable throughout the worst downturn in its history. We see significant leverage returning to this business in the up cycle.","Third, in SSG, Q2 non-GAAP operating margins were in line with the prior year when normalized for revenue despite an overall increase in SSG R&D spending. In SSG products, where we have significant share, the operating margins are very good. With increasing customer pull and a higher hit rate on product development, we believe that some of our lower share products are on the verge of significant increases in operating leverage. For us in AGS, non-GAAP operating margins increased to 23.2%, up 3 percentage points relative to the same quarter last year. There is an opportunity to grow AGS revenue and profitability.","Fifth, the efficiency of resources allocation can be improved between our businesses through a comprehensive product portfolio process. We should have low sticky assets in the company that we embarking on that process.","Sixth, in operations the vast majority of our product cost is materials. we plan to work aggressively across the company to design for lower cost, and also save money on existing products. This will take some work, but it is another significant opportunity.","Seventh, and finally, all of the functional organizations including operations, supply chain, finance, legal, human resources, IT and facilities need to be efficient and scaled appropriately for all of our business levels.","Now I\u2019ll cover our second quarter results and comment on changes from the prior quarter. Orders grew 7% led by strong demand for our semiconductor and display equipment. We generated net sales of approximately $2 billion, which was just above the high-end of our guidance, led by strength at Silicon Systems. all segments other than EES were at the high-end or exceeded our revenue expectations. Non-GAAP gross margins was 43.2%, up 3.4 points, driven primarily by the increase in revenue and lower inventory charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $567 million, in line with our guidance with G&A expenses down slightly relative to Q1.","We plan to reduce the G&A and manufacturing overhead components of our spending more time, both in absolute dollar terms, and as a percentage of non-GAAP operating expenses. we will continue to update you on our progress. In Q3, we expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million plus or minus $10 million, which includes a shutdown in the first week of July.","Our effective tax rate was 24.9% on a non-GAAP basis. We still expect the full-year rate to be between 24% and 26%. Cash flow operations was $224 million or 11% of revenue, reflecting severance payments relating to our previously announced workforce reductions and higher working capital requirements associated with the increase in revenue levels. We used $100 million to repurchase 7.5 million shares and returned $108 million in dividends.","The first payout at our recently increased dividend level will occur in the third quarter. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest in attractive opportunities in our core businesses, increase the dividend in line with the growth of the business, and utilize share repurchases to manage dilution and return excess cash to shareholders. Cash in investments ended the quarter at $2.85 billion, up slightly from Q1.","Next, I will comment on our Q2 segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were up 14% to $1.55 billion primarily driven by increases in NAND and DRAM. Foundry again represented the majority of our orders and remained highly concentrated.","SSG net sales increased 33% to $1.3 billion at the high end of our outlook of up to 20% to 35% driven by foundry and stronger DRAM spending. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 25.5% driven by the higher revenue. In AGS, orders were down 12% to $481 million due to the seasonal effect of service contract renewals and a slightly lower than anticipated improvement in customer utilization rates in wafer starts.","AGS net sales were up 10% to $517 million at the high end of our outlook. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 23.2% due to higher revenue and our cost management initiatives. Our display orders increased 41% to $195 million, reflecting the investment in new TV fabs in China along with share gains in multiple product lines. We expect orders to continue to increase in Q3.","Display net sales increased 46% to $127 million above our outlook of flat to up 25%. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 16.5%. ","EES orders were $39 million and net sales were $38 million. EES posted a non-GAAP operating loss of $34 million and we wrote off the remaining goodwill for the solar business in the quarter. We are lowering our spending in EES and the non-GAAP OpEx run rate is below $30 million per quarter exiting Q2. As mike mentioned, we expect to reduce EES quarterly spending to below $25 million exiting the fiscal year.","Now I will provide our third quarter business outlook. Overall, we expect the company\u2019s net sales to be up slightly from the second quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share should be in the range of $0.16 to $0.20. ","Here is my conclusion. We have very good product development people and IP. If we can get a high hit rate on understanding customers\u2019 high value problems and new fabs internally, we can significantly increase profitability.","Mike, Gary, and I see a clear path to profitable growth and we look forward to sharing more of that with you in July.","Now, let me turn over the call to Mike Sullivan for questions.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Bob. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one follow-up. Kia, let\u2019s begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. The first question will come from Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, the EES OpEx run rate is targeted to be about $25 million year end. Any sense for where that was this quarter. Thank you.","Bob Halliday","Yeah, we exited the quarter as I mentioned, at $30 million and it might have been touch over that - the quarter, but we exited 31 going down for the rest of the year.","Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","And then my follow-up question is on the gross margin side, you said that part of the positive variance in gross margin was due to fewer inventory reserves, can you help us understand going forward whether you see that trend continuing or any insight on gross margin going forward would be helpful? Thank you.","Bob Halliday","Gross margins are pretty good this quarter. The year-on-year comparison was aided by couple of things. We had some inventory reserves last year and then this year we had a good drop, so we had incremental revenues, which dropped through the gross margin line. If you look at our overall sales and expense and profitability guidance for next quarter, it implies reasonably positive gross margin opportunities next quarter also.","Operator","The next question will come from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So first just in terms of guidance, can you help us directionally how you think about the four segments that you guys have?","Bob Halliday","I will give it a shot, Edwin. Most are up a little bit, I think our sales will be up somewhat and I think it\u2019s pretty much across the board.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. How about your booking trends, this quarter your booking was quite a bit about your revenue, but next quarter you\u2019re just guiding to a modest increase in revenue. Does that mean that there is some comp softness in booking or how do you think about that and what are the moving parts between the foundry, logic et cetera?","Gary E. Dickerson","Edwin, as you know, we don't give the bookings guidance. We continue with the overall CapEx guidance of flat to down 10% as Mike talked about earlier. We're incrementally more optimistic, it\u2019s part of what happens in CapEx, it depends on just a few customers in foundry and memory spending later in the year.","So, overall, the key message I think for us is around the transition in transistor technology as Mike talked about earlier. That's the key battleground in mobility and that opportunity in the transistor inflection starting in 2014, also 3D memory, those are extremely positive opportunities for us to grow overall share.","Operator","The next question will come from Tim Arcuri with Cowen & Company.","Tim M. Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, a couple of things; first, Bob, just based on the answer you just gave can we assume that revenue in SSG will be up, I know you don't want to talk about bookings, but revenue will be up, is that right?","Bob Halliday","Yeah, let me give you a little more color than I gave to Edwin. If you look at where the increase is, the increase is more concentrated in SSG and display and less sold in solar and AGS. So of our fix, SSG should do relatively well of the four.","Tim M. Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Okay, thanks. And R&D was up to a record high, I was going back to my model and I couldn't find anything this high. I know that you talked about 450 being less than a $100 million in fiscal 2012, but you haven\u2019t talked about what 450 will be this year. Is the increase due to 450 and maybe you can give us some sense of what the spending will be on 450 during this entire fiscal year? Thanks.","Gary E. Dickerson","Just as we said last quarter, really no net increase in 450 spending in our current plan. The key focus for us are around these technology transitions in the transistor and 3D memory. Those are big opportunities for us. As Mike talked about, the increase for us is about 25% in the gate-last technology, another 5% to 10% in FinFET technology, about 25% opportunity increase for us in the first generation of NAND Flash technology. So those are the areas where we\u2019re really focused on in terms of our R&D investments.","Michael R. Splinter","Yeah, Tim, I\u2019d add to that, we\u2019re seeing really good customer pull right now for the new products that we have in a number of areas. But even in inspection and Etch, which have traditionally been weak for us, customers are really pulling on us to offer new and better solutions as we go through the transistor change to 3D. We have some really good capability there that I think is quite differentiated.","Gary E. Dickerson","We\u2019re also increasing our investment in application support in the field. In our PDC business, we have the second highest bookings quarter, orders quarter in the history of PDC, and the highest ever orders quarter for our Brightfield business. So we\u2019re making investments in R&D, but we\u2019re also making investments in the field and application support and also focused on earlier and deeper collaborations with customers as they go through these device transitions.","Tim M. Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","","The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Thomas Yeh \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is Thomas Yeh calling in for Krish Sankar. Thanks for taking my questions. Just maybe some more color on the overall order sustainability heading into the second half, qualitatively; you noted order strength driven partially by memory. I was wondering if you saw any pullings related to that and wanted to get your perspective on the first half versus second half and what that might imply for the run rate heading towards the second half?","Michael R. Splinter","","Hey, Thomas, may be I can start with the market and then let Bob or Gary talk a little bit more specifically about order sustainability. What we are viewing on WFE for the year is that second half will be stronger. We think about 55% 45% range there. If you think about that relative to last year, we said this year that WFE will be flat to down 10%. And year-over-year when you are thinking about that, most of the down is in foundry because of the supply chain changes there. So I think the thing is that foundry is still a major, major part of the overall make up. But in the second half, we are seeing some increase spending from, in particular, memory, primarily from NAND Flash. But we\u2019re also seeing a little bit of pick up in DRAM as there are some supply constrains there with, in particular, mobile DRAM.","Thomas Yeh \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And Gary, you mentioned expectations for the total served available market increasing by 25% with the transition to 20 nanometers. Can you highlight which particular product segments within SSG that could provide the most areas of opportunity for you?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, the transistor, as we\u2019ve talked about before, is really the sweet spot for Applied Materials that where we have the strongest positions that includes epi and annealing, the implant business, CDP is actually also an area that\u2019s growing through new transistor technology. So those would be the areas that are going to grow the most and PVD is another one that\u2019s going to grow as we go to next generation transistors.","Operator","The next question will come from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs & Company.","Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great guys, thanks so much for taking the question, I appreciate it. Mike and Gary and Bob, you guys referenced the fact that some of the logic spending is coming down commensurate with some of the weakness in the PC segment. Do you think we felt the brunt of the impact there already, I noticed some of the big logic customers are significantly underspending their stated budgets. Do you think that we\u2019ve seen the worse of that in terms of order or shipment declines or do you think some of that could still impact the second half?","Gary E. Dickerson","Well, we believe that we have, but of course, we have to be able to see what the trend is like for back-to-school, sales in particular, certainly at this point, utilization is moving up. We expect spending in logic to move up modestly in the second half. And part of the reason we kept our overall WRP forecast flat was that, we saw some increase in foundry spending. We saw pretty much a commensurate decrease in logic spending. That\u2019s our best estimate at the current time, Jim. So that\u2019s kind of where we are.","Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","That makes a lot of sense. And from my follow-up, you guys have mentioned customer pulls in a number of areas, you specifically talked about, Mike even in some of the areas where you traditionally haven\u2019t had the strength. I\u2019ve heard you guys comment over the last 9, 12 months that some of the greatest pull from customers is in the process diagnostics areas, that\u2019s still kind of number one on the list of where you\u2019re seeing the customer pulls?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yeah, Jim, as I mentioned, we had our second highest quarter\u2019s quarter in the history of PDC last quarter and our highest ever in wafer infection.","Operator","The next question will come from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Thank you very much. Since you\u2019ve been talking about the transistor technology, I have a question on your exposure if I divide the wafer fab equipment into front end of the line and the back end of the line, what\u2019s the overall spending split and how is your exposure different, because you have higher transistor exposure?","Michael R. Splinter","I don\u2019t know that. I think one of things that Gary has been alluding to is how fast certain areas are growing for us. And we think the complexity around the transistor is going to grow significantly to be able to make these advanced 3D. There is a huge race to get the FinFET and advance the transistors and logic, there\u2019s a huge race to get the 3D devices and NAND Flash. And I think that\u2019s where we see the big growth or the exposure is growing fast there, I think about 25% in each of those areas. So that\u2019s really also in our sweet spot and our strength area and that\u2019s where we\u2019re also investing a lot of our new R&D dollars there to ensure that we can be there with the solutions our customers need.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then this \u2013 my follow-up is on the OpEx, you said in your next quarter\u2019s OpEx guidance you include one quarter or one week of shutdown, so will the OpEx increase in Q3?","Michael R. Splinter","The overall OpEx guidance was $550 million, plus or minus $10 million, which is down from Q2\u2019s $567 million. We get some benefit from the shutdown, but we\u2019re also managing other expenses pretty tightly too.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Bob Halliday","Welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Maybe a follow-up question, Bob, on the last point about just trying to deliver higher operating margins and higher revenues, just listening to your seven observations, I mean, is it fair to assume this is mostly going to be done from say more efficient OpEx management and maybe less there from higher gross margin since there is going to be three big silicon customers?","Bob Halliday","I think it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll do below the gross \u2013 I\u2019ll do the gross margins lines a bit. I think we can efficiency and cost savings on both expense line and the cost of goods line. And I think the opportunity is kind of half and half to be honest with you. I think R&D efficiency is also going to drive the faster product development and to certain extent it will be self funding between efficiency. I think on the gross margin line above that, people sometimes ask me about the question, can you increase your peak operating profit versus say 2011, we did all fairly.","So if you look at gross margins and you look at gross margin today we have a few things going in our favor. One, we have good mix between the segments where our future growth will be more incenting versus solar for instance in 2011. Secondly, we will, I think, will drive this cost reduction which I spoke of just a minute go. And thirdly, as we start to get some traction in some of these high value businesses, I think those have favorable pricing components. So actually the gross margins look okay, it\u2019s a combination of mix between segments, some potential mix between products, cost of goods sold reductions and pricing, you commercially negotiate all that stuff.","Stephen Chin \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. But may be a question, Mike, for your early thoughts on 2014 with wafer fab equipment spending yield, even if we assume end market demand for electronics to stay normal with all these silicon technology transitions that you are talking about happen in your 3D since that 20 nanometer, can we assume you\u2019re investing this year for another strong year in wafer fab equipment spend for next year too? Thanks.","Michael R. Splinter","","Thanks, Steven. I don\u2019t think we really formulated a detailed view on 2014, but maybe just a couple of thoughts. Assuming that let\u2019s say we can have another 30% plus year growth in smartphones and a 50% growth year in tablets, I think the foundry spending is flat to up and maybe up a little bit more than that because of complexity increases in the 20 and 16 nanometer and the push to advance transistors. And then I think we are going to see an investment cycle in NAND Flash, not quite, we don\u2019t precisely have that pegged yet on exactly how the cycle will go, but I think it will certainly start in 2014.","So in general, would be a positive view on 2014 and the downside is where is logic spending going to end up. But I would also say relative to where are we investing, we are absolutely focused on these technology transistors, the technology transitions. The transistor is a key battleground in mobility, 3D NAND is also a key battleground. So the opportunities for us are significant and that\u2019s the focus of our R&D dollars.","Operator","The next question will come from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.","Satya Kumar \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on your estimates or CapEx for the year. You mentioned that\u2019s between $27 billion, I was wondering if you could give us \u2013 give some color on the mix between DRAM, NAND, and logic, and specifically, within NAND Flash, I was wondering what part of the spending are you seeing happen in the first half versus the second half?","Michael R. Splinter","Sure, thanks, Satya. So first of all, I think one of the big trends is in and around foundry, spending has been quite concentrated as Bob alluded to. And we think in the second half, foundry spending will be roughly flat, but spread out among a wider array of our customers. We think that\u2019s the important factor is, you just started to think about what\u2019s going to happen here in the second half of the year. We think logic spending comes up from reasonably low levels in the first half of the year. And then we\u2019ll see growth in both DRAM and NAND spending, but we don\u2019t think they exceed 25% of the overall wafer fab equipment spend, that\u2019s putting them together, and I think some customers have fundable spending there. so we see positive trends in NAND and mobile DRAMs, so I think it moves up from sub 20 in the first half of the year on memory.","Satya Kumar \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And Mike, I guess like on NAND, are you seeing much wafer capacity additions in the back half? Do you have an estimate for how much wafer capacity is, that you think is being in NAND Flash this year?","Michael R. Splinter","I don\u2019t have a precise estimate, I think there\u2019s still capacity expansion within existing fabs that\u2019s everybody\u2019s first move because 3D NAND isn\u2019t ready yet and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see big expansions until we get to 3D NAND. And then as I said, we\u2019ll see a build investment cycle in NAND, but I think most of that\u2019s next year.","Satya Kumar \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","","The next question will come from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Mike, I just wanted to better understand the mix between 28 and 20 nanometer bookings that you see in the foundry space between the first half and the second half?","Michael R. Splinter","Well, the first half is pretty much all 28 nanometer. So we see 20 nanometer starting to pick up in the second half of the year, and still pilot production in the second half of the year. So maybe if you add up across the industry, you get between 25,000 and 50,000 wafers. But I think the key thing is working with customers on those real technology and yield problems as these new technologies get into production, that\u2019s really where our focus is with customers that\u2019s what \u2013 why they are calling us and why we are excited about not only the rest of this year, but the subsequent years.","It\u2019s very difficult to actually to \u2013 customers don\u2019t buy for one generation. So even though \u2013 initially go into 28 nanometer production, certainly they are looking forward to what are they going to do in 20 nanometer, 16 nanometer, and that\u2019s actually helping us pull some of our inspection tools, CMP tools and other products into 28 nanometer orders.","Vishal Shah \u2013 Deutsch Bank Securities","That\u2019s very helpful. I guess, the reason I was asking is, is there any sense from your standpoint of conversation with the customer that 20 nanometer production may get pushed out a little bit just as these customers try to open the new problems. And then you also mentioned that you had a really strong order quarter in the PDC business, are you seeing that strength from the foundry segment or is it coming also from memory space? Thank you.","Michael R. Splinter","First of all, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing anybody slowing down on 20 nanometers or thinking that this is going to be a small note, quite the contrary, they want to get this next generation of shrink in the production quickly, get the yields up, put in the 3D- transistor as quickly as possible. This was a real race and Gary?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yeah, on PDC, the strongest order, Paul, that we are seeing right now is from foundry and logic customers.","Vishal Shah \u2013 Deutsch Bank Securities","Thanks, guys.","","Operator","The next question will come from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray","Jagadish Iyer \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","","Thanks for my question. Two questions, first, Gary, you talked the SAM growth on the front end, how much of it will be visible in 2013 and how should we kid of reconcile this with the share gains you alluded earlier in your prepared remarks in the silicon?","Gary E. Dickerson","I am sorry.","Jagadish Iyer \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","I just wanted to find out how should we reconcile this with share gains that Mike alluded in the prepared remarks as you talk about the SAM growth in the front end, how much of it will be visible this year and how should we think about it going forward and then I have a follow up. Please.","Gary E. Dickerson","So the two major transitions that we are focused on right are the 20 nanometer gate-last transition, that\u2019s going to really be more in 2014, maybe at the end of 2013 and the other one is in 3D memory and certainly that\u2019s more \u2013 also more of a 2014 story.","Jagadish Iyer \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","Fair enough. And then I think you guys mentioned about the strength in the display segment. Can you help us there whether there is broad-based ordering in the display segment? You did allude to a major Chinese LCD factory coming up, are you seeing any other factories over Gen 8.5 coming up in probably the second half of this year or potentially in the horizon? Thank you.","Michael R. Splinter","","Jagadish, you asked about factories larger than 8.5? Okay, anyway, I think we\u2019re seeing very strong orders in display right now. We are projecting $800 million for the year, which is doubling over last year. And we are seeing most of the build out from multiple customers in China and no factories above 8.5 at this time. Although, we believe as the TVs get larger above 60 inches and they become a significant part of the overall mix that we will see customers move to Gen 10 and Gen 11.","Gary E. Dickerson","Thanks, Jagadish.","Operator","The next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. Mike, a question for you, you mentioned second half bigger than the first half, you mean shipment and revenue, it doesn\u2019t really say much about booking because due in lack of visibility into spending in 2014, bookings could be down or flat into the second half, correct?","Michael R. Splinter","Well, I think that\u2019s unlikely, but I think we are projecting, and when I look at our backlog, I think that\u2019s unlikely. Our backlog has been growing. I think it will grow into the third quarter, but it\u2019s not that far ahead of what we think shipments of revenue will be in the second half of the year especially if our 55-45 second half, first half mix comes out to be relatively accurate.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP","So I\u2019m confused, are you saying that both revenue and bookings will be up in the October quarter?","Michael R. Splinter","Well, I\u2019m not making a projection for October quarter at this point. Just talking with what the information we have today, looking first half, second half, whether \u2013 we don\u2019t see a scenario if spending is 55% of the total that bookings would be down in total in the second half. I mean, quarter-to-quarter, there can shifts.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Okay. And one question for Gary, I\u2019m going to ask you what I asked last quarter, you\u2019re talking about the share gain and everything, but can you please explain to me in a simple way other than ASP, what is it that you were doing to enable you to gain market share in a oligopolistic environment? You only have one competitor in each segment, so what is it other than ASP that enables you to go and actually gain market share without giving out much margin?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yeah, the key thing for us is to focus on the key \u2013 high value problems for our customers. If you look at display for instance, this concept applies to all of our different businesses. We\u2019re focused on the key device performance and yield challenges of our customers. So as they go to larger panel sizes and smaller pixels, the particle requirements are increasing from 10 to 100 times to get equivalent yield. So our focus there is on how do we have an architectural advantage that delivers better particles than our competitors. The same thing is true as you go to larger panel sizes. Customers if they had a \u2013 if we have a certain uniformity on our product, they can sell the panels into their own brand.","If they have a worst uniformity, they go to an OEM brand at a much lower margin. So the leverage in yield and the leverage in device performance for our customer is significant and that is the strategy that we are pursuing that is growing share in the display business today. The same thing is true in the semiconductor business.","As our customers move to new transistor technologies, as they move to new 3D memory technologies, these transitions as you go to FinFET or other devices are extremely difficult. They have big challenges in trying to drive time to market for these products and it is the key battleground for our customers in mobility. Our products that enable those transitions in the architectures that\u2019s where we are focused, that\u2019s why we are increasing our R&D spending, that\u2019s why we are increasing the technical support of our customers in the field and that\u2019s the formula at least for me and 30 years in this industry, that\u2019s the same formula I\u2019ve seen work in every one of these different businesses.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP","So\u2026","Gary E. Dickerson","Thank you, Mehdi.","Michael R. Splinter","We\u2019ve got time for just two more questions please.","Operator","The next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks a lot. May be just following up on that comments you made about the drag towards 14 nanometers FinFET with the foundries. Customers have talked about accelerating that from 28 through 20 and possibly even skipping some of the 20 and going straight to 14-nanometer FinFET. I guess, how do you rationalize, I guess, what the customers are looking for there? And from what process segments do you see, I guess, an expansion at the 14-nanometer node, is it the same one as 20, or if you see areas like CVD also growing faster than the marketplace?","Bob Halliday","So the first transition that will make a tangible difference to our growth in share and revenue is really 28-nanometer gate last. And then customers will move to FinFET technologies at 16 and 14 nanometers where there\u2019s still more incremental opportunities for us. The really big areas of focus for us are around the transistor as I talked about earlier with epi, anneal, implant, PVD, and there are more CMP steps as the customers move to FinFET technology.","So those are the ones that with these transistor technology changes that there are the real big opportunities for us. I would say also, I talked a little bit about combining the precision films with precision materials removal, material modification, and interface engineering, and we\u2019re certainly seeing more of those types of issues where combining these precision materials engineering technology could provide our customers with a real device performance and yield advantage and also be very positive for Applied Materials as we combine these technologies on our platforms.","Patrick J. Ho \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, that\u2019s really helpful. Bob, a question for you on the materials cost reduction that you talked about on the call, is it more of the design phase that you\u2019re going to be working on helping to reduce that front or is it the supply chain or is it a combination of both?","Bob Halliday","It will be both. We\u2019re going to do both and some of the things we\u2019re going to do to enable both is getting tighter alignment across the organization between operations, the business units, the guys who control the releasing of products to the suppliers. So there is a path to do this., I would say that, we\u2019ll get incremental progress on both and it will be cumulative. The good thing about materials cost reduction as you start to build the momentum, it\u2019s annuity payment, right. You get it every year on equipment, you get it on spare parts. So it\u2019s an annuity payment that every year goes up, you had several points of cost reduction, it\u2019s cumulative over time.","Patrick J. Ho \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Bob Halliday","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Ben Pang with B. Riley & Company.","Ben Pang \u2013 B. Riley & Company","Thanks for squeezing me in, two quick ones; first, relative to the $27 billion to $30 billion you referenced for spending, what\u2019s your served available market for 2013?","Michael R. Splinter","Roughly half, it\u2019s 51% or 52% I think of that total.","Ben Pang \u2013 B. Riley & Company","Okay. And then in terms of the 3D NAND, you mentioned some early shipments, second half of this year, is it easy for the customers to deploy that for planer if they want to or are there significantly different configurations for the tools that they\u2019ve locked in, if they make a decision on 3D NAND right away?","Michael R. Splinter","Yeah, the customers that are making those early transitions are really focused on the 3D NAND technology, and they are very different. Some of these steps are very different than what you see in planer NAND.","Ben Pang \u2013 B. Riley & Company","Thank you very much.","Gary E. Dickerson","Thanks, Ben. And I appreciate your questions. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Applied\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings call, which is being recorded.","Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied\u2019s most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filings with the SEC.","Today\u2019s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today\u2019s earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike. I\u2019m pleased to report that earnings for our first fiscal quarter exceeded the top-end of our guidance, reflecting outstanding execution across the Company in a market environment that is strengthening. Based on our calendar year revenues, we believe we outperformed both the markets and our direct peers in 2019. We entered 2020 with momentum, and the signals we see give us increased confidence that the years ahead will be very good for the industry, and especially for Applied Materials.","In today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll give you my perspective on how our markets are evolving and provide our near-term outlook. Then, I\u2019ll highlight the key components of our strategy to address the changing needs of our customers and drive sustainable profitable growth for Applied Materials.","Before I get started, I\u2019ll take a minute to address the implications of the coronavirus outbreak. To direct a comprehensive response across all the regions where we operate, we quickly activated our business continuity teams. Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees and their families. We\u2019re also doing everything we can to provide our customers the support they need to minimize disruption to their business. In addition, the Applied Materials Foundation is sending medical equipment into Wuhan, and we\u2019ve created humanitarian response fund for our employees in China, and the communities where they live and work.","In terms of the business our current assessment is that the overall impact for fiscal 2020 will be minimal. However, with travel and logistics restrictions, we do expect changes in the timing of revenues during the year. We are actively managing the situation in collaboration with our customers and suppliers.","While we\u2019re making the necessary adjustments to our near-term plans, we are not taking our eye off the powerful trends that are driving the semiconductor industry forward and creating a structurally larger and less volatile market. At the low point of this recent downcycle in customer spending, which occurred in the second calendar quarter of 2019, the combined quarterly revenues of the top five semi-equipment companies were only 17% lower than at the cycle\u2019s peak. In contrast, during the industry cycles that took place between 2000 and 2013, peak-to-trough revenues for the same five companies combined, dropped on average 44%.","Another important metric we look at is equipment intensity or annual equipment spending as a percentage of annual semiconductor industry revenues. Between 1990 and 2014, this equipment intensity metric fluctuated between 17% and 6%. However, when we look at the most recent five-year period, equipment intensity has been in a tight band of 10.5% to 12% with a mean of 11.5%. We believe this is a good estimate going forward and reflects the ever more complex technology challenges we\u2019re addressing and the increasing value we\u2019re delivering to the ecosystem. In addition to the higher growth and lower cyclicality we see in the market as a whole, Applied is demonstrating even lower volatility than our peers. The reasons for this include the breadth of our product portfolio and the balance we have across different device segments. Dan will provide more color on this topic in his section.","Moving to our near-term outlook. We see robust foundry\/logic investment continuing. There is a strong commitment on the part of these customers to advance the leading-edge as they get ready for demand related to the rollout of 5G. At the same time, we\u2019re also seeing healthy spending for specialty nodes to support growing demand from the IoT, communications, automotive, power and image sensor markets.","Progression in the memory market is consistent with the view we\u2019ve shared over the past several quarters. NAND appears to be in the early stages of recovery with prices rising and inventory levels down to 4 to 5 weeks that\u2019s compared to 8 to 10 weeks this time last year. We also see a good setup for DRAM to recover. Encouraging signs include supplier and end-market inventories that are starting to get back to normal levels and prices that appear to have bottomed. These leading indicators bode well for a pickup in investment by memory customers later in the year.","Overall, we like the way the market is shaping up for 2020 and beyond. We believe that our semiconductor business can deliver strong double-digit growth this year and feel very good about our longer term opportunities. In display, there are no major changes to the outlook we provided last quarter. We expect FY20 revenues to be similar to FY19 as the industry navigates the bottom of this spending cycle. We still believe that display is an attractive adjacent market for Applied that provides good long-term growth opportunities. The business remains solidly profitable, even as we make the necessary investments to ensure that we have the right portfolio of products ready for when the market picks up.","Stepping back and looking at this year in its broader context it\u2019s important to note that the overall electronics industry is in a period of expansion and diversification. Major new growth drivers, including IoT, big data and artificial intelligence are layering on top of traditional demand for smartphones and PCs. As I look ahead, I strongly believe that the future will not be like the past. The emerging workloads that will shape the next era of computing require domain-specific approaches, new system architectures, and new types of semiconductor devices. I believe that we need a new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing to deliver the power, performance and area cost improvements that will unlock the potential of AI and big data.","At Applied, we\u2019ve aligned our strategy and investments around this new playbook, so that we can enable new system architectures, new devices and 3D structures, the introduction of novel new materials, new advances in 2D geometric shrinks, and new ways to connect chips together through advanced packaging.","Applied has a unique portfolio of materials engineering capabilities and products to enable the new playbook. Getting these new technologies to market faster has never been more valuable. And this is a major emphasis across the company. For example, we\u2019re using advanced metrology sensors, data science and simulation to improve learning rates, speed of the transfer of new technologies from Applied\u2019s labs to customers\u2019 factories, and reduce the time it takes to optimize device performance, yield, output and cost. In addition, we have more engagement with the broader ecosystem than ever before, focused on accelerating innovation all the way from materials to systems.","Our strategy is yielding results for our customers and Applied. Calendar 2019 was a new record for our foundry\/logic revenues, and the current leading edge node transition further grows our opportunity. For an equivalent number of wafer starts, our available market increases by more than 10%. We\u2019re also generating record revenue from specialty markets where customers build their technology upon trailing geometries. For these customers, the innovation roadmap is driven by materials innovation rather than geometric scaling. Strengthened leading edge combined with healthy investments and specialty nodes means that several of our leadership businesses, including metal deposition and Epi are delivering record revenue.","At the same time, we continue building momentum in areas of the market where we still have plenty of room to grow. In the quarter, we secured major application wins for critical etch steps at both foundry\/logic and memory customers. Our process diagnostics and control business delivered record quarterly revenue, driven by strong adoption of our new optical wafer inspection system and continued strength in our leading eBeam products. We\u2019re also making great progress in packaging. As the industry introduces increasingly sophisticated packaging approaches, our strategy has been to focus on addressing the most critical process steps. As a result, we\u2019ve been steadily gaining market share. Our packaging business delivered record revenues in 2019 while winning well over 50% of our available market.","Another important growth factor for the Company is our service business. Equipment maintenance is an attractive recurring revenue stream for Applied and in calendar 2019, we added more than 2000 systems to our installed base. As I\u2019ve talked about before, we are finding new ways to deliver value through data-enabled services that accelerate customers\u2019 fab ramps and optimize their device performance, yield, output and cost in high-volume manufacturing. As we do this, we\u2019re increasing number of installed base systems covered by long-term maintenance agreements. In the past 12 months alone, we have grown the number of systems covered by these agreements by nearly 15%.","Before I hand the call over to Dan, I will quickly summarize. While we\u2019re adapting our near-term plans in response to the coronavirus outbreak, our outlook for 2020 remains very positive. We believe we can drive strong double-digit growth in our semiconductor business this year and significantly outperform the market. We also like the setup for 2021 and beyond. Our markets are better than ever with powerful new growth drivers still only in their early innings. Applied\u2019s opportunities have also never been better. We are uniquely positioned to enable the new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing while helping our customers accelerate innovation from materials to systems.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Durn","Thanks, Gary.","Applied Materials returned to year-over-year growth in Q1 with revenue up 11% and non-GAAP EPS up 21%, versus the same period last year. Revenue and gross margin exceeded the midpoint of our guidance and earnings were above the high-end of our range. Our revenue performance was driven by semiconductor systems, which was up 24% year-over-year. We generated nearly $1 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter and returned close to $400 million to shareholders. Our business outlook calls for continued strength in Q2 and our second half. Our relative performance is especially strong. We outgrew the overall semi equipment market in calendar 2019 and we significantly outperformed our closest peers.","Applied has made strong investments across our portfolio in recent years. And today, we are larger and more resilient company that performs well in a variety of market conditions. One of Applied\u2019s unique attributes is our broad portfolio, which is more diversified across end markets and more balanced among semiconductor device types, including memory, leading edge and specialty nodes in logic, and packaging.","Our portfolio makes us more stable relative to our past and relative to our peers, the closest of which were 50% to 100% more volatile in the recent cycle. Today, our traditional strength in foundry\/logic is apparent as we set new quarterly records for overall foundry\/logic revenue as well as in metal deposition and process control system sales. Our investments in memory have given us a balanced share profile and this will enable us to continue to generate strong returns when spending recovers later this year.","A key pillar of our stability is our aftermarket business, which includes Applied Global Services and our 300-millimeter upgrades and refurbs. Our aftermarket revenue is a product of three drivers, installed base growth, the higher service intensity of new nodes, and our data-enabled service agreements. Our service agreements provide a higher return on investment for our customers and subscription-like recurring revenue for Applied. In Q1, AGS generated record revenue of nearly $1 billion. Our overall aftermarket business also set a new record in Q1 and has grown every year since 2013. Against this backdrop, we\u2019re pleased to be making further progress towards the acquisition of Kokusai Electric, which has an outstanding equipment business, a very large installed base and a highly talented management team.","During the quarter, we received regulatory approvals from Japan and Korea. And we grew our cash position by over $350 million as we prepare for the transaction. As a reminder, upon close, we plan to prioritize our free cash flow towards repaying the term loan we\u2019re using to help finance the transaction. We expect to limit buybacks until we\u2019ve repaid the loan.","Next, I\u2019ll comment on the near-term environment and provide our Q2 guidance. Since the middle of January, our business continuity team has been working around the clock assessing the needs and capabilities of our employees, customers and suppliers. I\u2019m impressed by the decisive action and compassion being demonstrated by our people across the globe. Our Q2 guidance ranges are wider than usual. And our revenue forecast reflects all of the risk factors we can see today. In Q2, we expect our overall revenue to be $4.34 billion, plus or minus $200 million, which would be up by about 23% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP earnings to be $1.04 per share, plus or minus $0.06. The midpoint would be up nearly 50% year-over-year.","Within the outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to be around $3.05 billion, up by around 40% year-over-year. Our services revenue should be about $955 million and display revenue should be around $310 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of around 45.4%, which would be up nearly 2 points year-over-year, and non-GAAP OpEx should be around $820 million.","Finally, I will give you some additional color on how our risk-adjusted Q2 guidance compares to the strong underlying demand for our products and services. Absent the near-term risks, our revenue guidance would have been about $300 million higher at the midpoint or up about 30% year-over-year, and AGS revenue would have exceeded $1 billion. While the situation remains fluid, we believe we can address the vast majority of our unmet Q2 demand in Q3 and Q4 and deliver strong growth for the year.","In summary, we are seeing very strong demand for our products, solutions and services. We have a broad, diverse and balanced portfolio that is delivering strong relative performance and stability in a variety of market conditions. As Gary outlined, the semiconductor industry is enjoying a new wave of growth, and the equipment industry is growing along with our customers. For Applied\u2019s part, we\u2019re investing in new products and solutions that will accelerate the new playbook and position Applied Materials to deliver superior performance, stable growth and shareholder returns.","Now, Mike, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Dan. Now, I know there are a lot of people on the call today. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and not more than one brief follow-up. Operator, let\u2019s please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open.","C.J. Muse","Yes. Good afternoon. And apologies for the noise in the background. I guess, first question, can you speak to gross margin leverage, as you look forward, particularly around an accelerating service business combined with -- on the tool side where you are mix-wise leadership versus growth, and some of the new products as they layer in? I would love to hear your thoughts around that.","Dan Durn","Thanks, C.J.","As we look at gross margins, I think, it\u2019s important to look at the evolution of the business over time. We\u2019re different business today. We\u2019re driving a significant amount of growth in foundry\/logic, but we\u2019re also more diversified business than we\u2019ve been in the past. If you were to go back a handful of years, you would have seen us spike highly in the foundry business from a share perspective, and the other three device types were mid-teens. And today, we\u2019re a very-balanced portfolio, and I think that\u2019s served us really well in 2019, both from a revenue volatility standpoint, significantly less than the peers in the industry, but also from a gross margin standpoint, the Company has performed pretty well in the most recent downturn.","As we go forward, foundry\/logic is going to continue to be a strong market for the industry. The trend line on foundry\/logic is up into the right. Every quarter won\u2019t be a record, but we will see an upward trending market, less volatility and higher highs and higher lows. Embedded within that strength in foundry\/logic is growth in specialty nodes and technologies as edge devices proliferate. This is a great business for a strong driver of cash flow, strong driver of operating margins. You\u2019re also seeing us in the broad set of markets drive businesses like etch over time. We are making significant share gains into the NAND market followed by DRAM and then foundry\/logic, and the Company is performing really, really well, growing that market share. And we\u2019re going to continue to do that going forward.","And so, you see an evolution and profile change of the business. You also see our services business going structurally larger. It\u2019s a great source of stable revenues, cash flows and operating margin for the business. And so, we\u2019re a broader, bigger, more resilient business, and it\u2019s going to change the profile of the business over time. As you look at gross margin for the rest of this year, our semi systems business on a half over half progression looks fairly linear, and then you see a growing services business into the back half of the year, and a growing display business into the back half of the year, and all three of those business look positioned to grow well into 2021. And so, where we\u2019re guiding Q2, we expect to be around those levels for the rest of 2020 against this mix profile as we see into the back half of the year. Are we ever satisfied with gross margins as they exist today? No. Are we looking to continually optimize the performance of this Company and drive as much of value for our shareholders? Absolutely. And we\u2019re going to continue to drive as hard as possible at delivering that value. But, I think that gives you a good sense of where gross margin is going to go for the rest of this year and some of the drivers of our business that deliver that result.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. I guess, as a quick follow-up. Can you speak to I guess the improved visibility that you have to memory, and kind of one of the guideposts that gives you the confidence on the second half from foundry over to memory to sustain the growth through the year and into next year? Thank you.","Dan Durn","Yes. Thanks C.J. I think, the best way I\u2019d describe the profile and shape of the business in 2020. We\u2019re going to continue to see strength in foundry\/logic throughout the year. And we\u2019re seeing early signs of memory recovery today. I think, ultimately what happens in 2020 is really going to depend on the magnitude of the memory recovery later in the year. We posted a really strong fiscal Q1, our guide into fiscal Q2 we see is very strong, and we see that strength continuing into the back part of the year. Again, we\u2019re going to be relatively balanced half-over-half in our systems business. And the ultimate shape of that systems business and strength in the back part of the calendar year is going to be a function of what we\u2019ve been saying for a couple quarters now, which is, it\u2019s going to depend on the magnitude of the memory recovery later in the year. But right now, we feel really good given what we see, fairly balanced half-over-half from a semi systems standpoint. And I think there\u2019s an opportunity to do better in our fiscal Q4 and our fiscal Q1 as the memory recovery begins to accelerate.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. C.J., this is Gary. I\u2019ll add a little bit more color. Certainly, what we see for the year is foundry\/logic, NAND, DRAM pretty balanced. And relative to the memory recovery and timing, we talked about the supply and demand, the inventory levels on the prepared remarks. And then, obviously, we also have demand signals coming from our customers. So, that\u2019s really what is driving our comments relative to the way the year is going to shape out, and also the balance in all of those different segments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is now open.","Atif Malik","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and good job on results and guidance. I have a question on the display business. Flattish outlook, not super exciting this year. Gary, does this make you look at some of the disruptive products in the R&D pipeline, like the evaporation or the inkjet tools differently? And if you can share the long-term view on display market?","Gary Dickerson","So display, we still see as a very attractive adjacent market for the Company. If you look at the growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last few years, it\u2019s up significantly. I think, we\u2019re around a $0.5 billion. The business was up over $2 billion, down a little bit this year, but still a very, very attractive market. And certainly, our near-term guidance is impacted also because of the coronavirus. Some of our customers are in areas that are impacted. And so, that reduced our guidance in terms of Q2. But as Dan said, we see the second half of the year being very positive. And we also, if you think about visual experiences and the way they differentiate, different mobile devices, or all of the trillion connected devices that will be happening, will be growing over the next several years, we see that that market\u2019s going to continue to grow.","So, 2021, we certainly see the business being up a fair amount over what we see in 2020. The capital intensity is rising as new technologies are adopted. So, we see a good opportunity in our core business. And certainly just like we do in semi, we\u2019re very-focused on enabling customer roadmaps and enabling new structures, new materials for our customers. So, we have those investments that we\u2019re also making in terms of display. We\u2019re making good progress on the pipeline of those new opportunities. Not going to announce anything here on the call today, but we\u2019re still very optimistic overall about the business and also those new opportunities.","Atif Malik","Great. And then, a quick one for Dan. Dan, on OpEx, I know you don\u2019t like to peg OpEx to a ratio. And how should we think about the spending for the rest of the year?","Dan Durn","Yes. I think in the current environment, $820 million a quarter feels like about the right level. You\u2019ll obviously see us continue to drive discipline into our spend. I think, you\u2019ve seen that over time over the last handful of years, operating leverage has delivered some - pretty significant reductions of OpEx as a percent of sales. And right now, R&D as a percent of OpEx is at an all time high for the Company. So, I think the Company is being very-disciplined from a discretionary spend standpoint, and investing the right amount of money to capture the significant opportunities we see in front of us. But, we\u2019ll continue to monitor those opportunities and guide one quarter at a time, but this level feels about right.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. I guess, I would add one thing to that. I think, we\u2019re not emotional over the investments we\u2019re making. We make investments where we think we can drive shareholder value. So, that\u2019s basically the way we look at that this. We do have a point of view. I think, as a leader, you need to have a point of view and courage in terms of how you drive your business. We believe that this business is going to be fundamentally bigger based on AI, big data, IoT layering on top of mobile and social media and PCs. So, we see that that business is going to be larger and the new playbook that I talked about in the prepared remarks for AI and big data is absolutely essential as classic Moore\u2019s Law is slowing. So, we see tremendous opportunities. Applied is in the best position, if you look at the five aspects of that new playbook and we\u2019re going to make those investments. And as I said earlier, 2021 shapes up really well for us, many different aspects come together and we definitely see great growth opportunities going forward. But, we also are not emotional about how we make those investments. So, we\u2019re not married to anything.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on solid results. Gary, you\u2019ve given us a lot of qualitative guidance on semi cap equipment spending for this year. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us a sense of what you think the overall WFE market grows in calendar year \u201820? But perhaps more importantly, how important is China in your mind to that growth? Can you help kind of profile the Chinese spend between sort of memory, foundry\/logic? I got to imagine a lot of edge logic stuff you were talking about in your prepared comments is situated in China. But, how do we think about that?","Dan Durn","Yes. Thanks, John. This is Dan. I\u2019ll jump in and take that. So, let\u2019s break it up into pieces. Let\u2019s first talk about WFE in 2020 and the growth rate over \u201819 and then I\u2019ll come back and talk a little bit about China and what we see in that market embedded in that overall growth rate. So, we think, 2020 is going to be a really strong year for the industry. We feel good about that. The ultimate question around growth rate is a function of what you use as a starting reference point for 2019. So, I\u2019m going to break this up piece-by-piece. Hopefully, I can shed some light and be hopeful to clear up, I think some of the confusion that existed in the market. So, what\u2019s important is, as we establish a reference point for 2019, and then we talk about growth off of that. So we know the number for 2019 WFE. It\u2019s not mid-40s. I think one advantage we have is we\u2019ve got a very broad portfolio and we got insight into all the different device types. And that gives us some unique insights in terms of market sizing. So, let me share with you what we\u2019re seeing, and hopefully we can help out.","2018 was $56 billion. That\u2019s according to Gartner. It\u2019s a good number. It\u2019s validated by a third-party. So, 2018 was $56 billion. Off of that number, we see 2019 down 10% to 12%. And that\u2019s the baseline we\u2019re using for 2020 growth. We see 2020 as a market up 10% to 15% based on everything we see and likely at the high end of that range, given the conversations we\u2019re having with customers.","So, while it\u2019s too early to know 2020 with precision. 2019 is very clear as a baseline. So, hopefully now the baseline for 2019 is clear, off of that baseline, we\u2019re likely up 15%. We expect to significantly outgrow the market with our semi-systems business. And it\u2019s not one device type.","Coming to China, embedded in that outlook. As we think about 2019 and where that ended? We see that market as about $6.5 billion. And we see growth off of that market of about $2 billion to $3 billion. Embedded within that, if you take a look at that $2 billion to $3 billion, I would say a third of it is 200-millimeter trailing node foundry\/logic, two thirds of it is 300-millimeter business. Of the two thirds that\u2019s 300-millimeter business, it\u2019s roughly evenly split between trailing nodes foundry\/logic and memory. And there\u2019s balance within the memory profile.","And so, I think that gives you a sense of what we\u2019re thinking for the China market. And if I were to take a step back and distill down what we\u2019re seeing. We see consistent, steady, ecosystem building, investments in technology roadmaps with modest capacity additions. And even if we look at the $2 billion to $3 billion of incremental spend that we\u2019re seeing in China, and domestic China, and we take a look at what it costs to build new memory factory, $7 billion, $8 billion, or a new foundry\/logic factory of $15 billion to $18 billion even, embedded within that $2 billion to $3 billion of growth, its modest capacity additions. And part of that spend is 200 millimeter, part of it is 300 millimeter with diversification across device types. Hopefully that helps shed some light on both the overall WFE market, john, as well as what we\u2019re seeing in China. ","John Pitzer","That\u2019s great color. And then, quickly as my follow-up, I want to make sure I heard you correctly. I think you said in the prepared comments that for the full fiscal year 2220, you expect flat panel to be roughly flattish, year-over-year which would kind of imply a second half run rate of close to $1 billion if not slightly over. I\u2019m just kind of curious as to why are you confident about that? Is it mainly because the $300 million Cushion you had in the April guidance with a coronavirus is mostly coming out of flat panel or headed by thinking about the math right on that?","Dan Durn","Yes. So, let me start with the math. You are thinking about the math correctly. We\u2019ve had a point of view for couple quarters that revenue in 2020 in the display business is going to be similar to what we saw in 2019. Everything we see in the market today, increases the confidence we have in terms of that outlook. So, no change to the full year guidance.","As we look at the risk we\u2019ve assessed as part of the coronavirus, we think we\u2019re taking a -- first of all, we think the risk is temporary and we think there is no change to our full year outlook, fiscal year outlook as a result of that. And so, we think we\u2019re being prudent in derisking our guide by about $300 million and we see recovery of those revenues in Q3, Q4, as we unpack $300 million across our reporting segments. We talked about services, would have been our first billion-dollar quarter, but we\u2019ve derisked it based on the virus. In terms of rank order of the $300 million, first, most impacted is our semi systems business, followed by our display business, followed by our service business. So, if you put the pieces together without being point specific on any one of those, I think you get a sense of how much we\u2019ve derisked our services business, display will be incrementally more than that, and semi systems will be incrementally more than that. The some of those three will equal $300 million.","Our thesis around display being -- or I\u2019m sorry, TVs being a recovery market -- or going through a digestion period in the market. You\u2019ll see recovery of the handset market. That framing of the profile of spend in Display still holds. We see both markets looking good into 2021, and we think we return to nice growth profile in the back part of the year and into 2021.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Krish Sankar from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Krish Sankar","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And Dan, again, thanks for the terrific color on all the industry stuff. Two-part question. Number one is based on your guidance of roughly $3 billion for semis and around the same, maybe plus or minus $200 million for the rest of fiscal \u201820. It looks like when I look at your last cyclical peak in April 2018, you guys did about $3 billion and then the sales trailed off. I understand at the time it was SSG, now with semi systems, there is probably some shift in numbers. But overall, it looks like you can sustain a $3 billion sales number for the rest of the fiscal year. I\u2019m kind of curious from your vantage point, how much of this growth versus the prior peak number was capital intensity going up versus AMAT\u2019s specific share gains? And then, the second quick housekeeping question on your color on China. If I remember right, I think you said 200-millimeter is going to be a third of your number, which is about $3 billion for China WFE. I\u2019m kind of surprised it\u2019s that high, given the fact that last year if I remember right, China 200-millimeter is really $0.5 billion, why is it jumping up so much this year? Thank you.","Dan Durn","Yes. Thanks, Krish. So, taking the second question first, we\u2019ve been talking about specialty nodes, we\u2019ve been talking about trailing node geometries, we\u2019ve been talking about billions of edge devices and intelligence on the edge and sensor technologies that are supporting the buildout of the Internet of Things. And we see trailing node geometries is one place that China can, in the near term, play a strong role in helping to build out their ecosystem in a disciplined way. And so, it fits in with the framing that we\u2019ve been talking about technology development, ecosystem development, and disciplined investments to support that ecosystem from a capacity standpoint. And so, it\u2019s very consistent from a framing standpoint.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. I think, on a -- maybe I can add something on this part of the question. If you look at this market, IoT, communication, auto, power devices, sensors, it has a very, very high growth rate. And innovation is driven by materials innovation. So, 2018 was the first year machines generated more data than people. In the next five years, the forecasts are that machines will generate 10 times more data than people. And when you go to CES, you see everything getting smarter. So, this market is a big market. I think, specifically to your question in China, your numbers are roughly correct. Our numbers are a little bit different, but roughly correct that there\u2019s a lot of growth in China in these areas. And they can build those types of devices.","And so, if you look at 1 trillion connected devices at the edge by 2030, the explosion of data and really the transformation of many industries, healthcare, education, you see retail, transportation, all of these areas growing very fast. And the companies that are growing quickly from a market cap standpoint are companies that are data centric companies. So again, I think that\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing is this explosion of data. And this market is a very big market. Applied has a very strong position. We put together in the last year a team of great leaders across the Company for 300-millimeter and smaller wafer sizes. I personally am meeting many of the CEOs and R&D leaders in this ecosystem. And we have really, really strong momentum. One example is one particular large customer where we won two thirds of the available opportunities in a market that is very, very sticky over a long period of time.","So, I think you\u2019re correct in that. Maybe it\u2019s surprising that the market is growing like that. But we think this is really the early innings of these particular markets, IoT, communication, auto power and sensors from a growth perspective. And Applied has a really great position inside that market.","Dan Durn","And Chris, coming back to the first part of your question where you talked about growth and how much of it is share gain versus capital intensity. I think, it\u2019s important to take a step back and set a context around how the Company has evolved over time. If we were to go back a handful of years, we were strong in foundry, over 20% and around mid-teens in all three other device types. Today, we\u2019re balanced across all of the device types. The Company\u2019s made steady progress on that front over the last handful of years since Gary\u2019s took over the Company.","Your specific question referenced to time period in 2018. We were high-teens, a little over 19% from an overall WFE share standpoint that year. Today, we\u2019re -- I\u2019m sorry, 2019, we were a little over -- probably a little over 20% in 2019. So, we feel really good about the progress we made and significantly outperforming the peers and the market in 2019. So, you definitely see some share accretion playing out in the current environment.","The second thing I would say, our thesis around increasing capital intensity, you see it in the foundry\/logic, you see it NAND, you see it in DRAM. That thesis of increasing capital intensity over time is firmly intact. We know our customers are investing a lot of money in WFE. And so, their profitability -- WFE as a percent of their profitability has come down since 2012. WFE as a percent of EBITDA in memory and foundry\/logic is down 25% over the last half of dozen years. And so, they\u2019re spending a lot but they\u2019re making a lot of money. And so, the health of our customers is good as it\u2019s ever been.","And then, from a capital intensity standpoint, what we see is WFE as a percent of overall semiconductor industry revenue bottomed around 2013 at 9%. Of course we\u2019re taking the one data point around the \u201808, \u201809 downturn of 6% off the table. 2013, it was 9%. And Gary referenced in his prepared comments, we\u2019ve been in a tight band, centered around 11.5% for the last five years. So, it\u2019s a clear indication, this industry is experiencing increased capital intensity. The macro demand drivers driving the overall semiconductor industry are firmly intact. Semiconductors are going to go structurally larger as the data economy kicks in. And by implication, our industry and Applied Materials are going structurally larger. So, we think the opportunities in front of us have never looked as good as they do today, and we are really excited about what we see.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. One way to combat the slowing of traditional Moore\u2019s Law on the manufacturing front, but still drive Moore\u2019s Law like performance improvement at the chip level is through the use of these advanced package, whether that\u2019s chiplet strategy, multi-chip die stacking. You guys have a pretty strong position in these markets. How is this segment expected to do this year? And roughly how big is your advanced packaging segment relative to the size of your overall semi business?","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. So, you\u2019re right. We talked about this new playbook going beyond the classic 2D shrinking and Moore\u2019s Law. And packaging is one of those five drivers for the new playbook, and it really, really, really is very important. The one example is, if you take GPU in a new package and this is a product that was released over the last couple of years, you get 50% lower power and 3x increase in speed, 3 times increase in speed just from the package. So, definitely, really important as part of the new playbook.","From an Applied perspective, we had record revenues in packaging in 2019 and we have really strong momentum into 2020. We have the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions to support the packaging roadmaps for our customers, and as you talked about, heterogeneous integration approaches. In 2019, we won over 50% of the applications we competed for, and we have this broad portfolio with CVD, PVD, CMP, plating, and etch where we have highly differentiated new products.","We have very deep engagement with leading customers. And there\u2019s a lot of focus on innovating with new packaging architectures. Applied has very deep engagements with really across the whole ecosystem. Those engagements are really driven by two things. One, we have the broadest portfolio of current and new products that haven\u2019t been announced yet that are enabling from a packaging perspective. We also have the most advanced packaging lab where we can run entire end to end process and codevelop new packaging technology with leading customers and partners. So again, overall very strong momentum with record business in \u201819. And I think this area -- we haven\u2019t quantified it in terms of dollar amount, but it\u2019s sizable. And I would say relative to growth opportunities and as one of the elements of the new playbook, it\u2019s underappreciated and the opportunities are bigger than what people would think, relative to our growth potential here.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for the insights there. And then, you guys have talked about memory spending recovery, with NAND leading the way this year. But with DRAM pricing now steadily rising, especially in mobile and servers, and looking to be sustainable, and you\u2019ve also got the new gaming console platforms launched in the second half that are driving pretty strong demand growth for graphics DRAM. Are you guys starting to get some visibility on a return to spending by some of your DRAM customers in the second half of this year?","Dan Durn","Yes. Thanks, Harlan. I\u2019ll take that. I think, what we see, we talked about the magnitude of the growth we see in WFE year-over-year into 2020. Our view on that is as it\u2019s broad-based. I think that you\u2019ll see a good profile from foundry logic. I think, you see a good profile from memory and I think you will see balance across device types within memory. The growth profile into 2020 is going to be across those different device types. And yes, we will start seeing DRAM this year.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thank you.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Harlan. Operator, we still have a number of people in the queue. I\u2019d like to have us please move to one question per person. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from Newstreet Research. Your line is now open.","Pierre Ferragu","Hi. Thanks, guys for taking my question. On foundry\/logic, you had like a record quarter, $1.9 billion. I was surprised -- I was curious to see how much of that comes from deep EUV nodes where a lot of capacity is being added today, [Technical Difficulty] and how much of the revenues are already coming from the new EUV nodes?","Michael Sullivan","Hi, Pierre. This is Mike. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t hear. I think you\u2019re maybe on the cell phone. So, we can tell you were talking about foundry and the mix of getting to a number like 1.9. But, we unfortunately couldn\u2019t hear the rest of the details of your question. So, we\u2019re not sure how to respond. Could you try one more time, please?","Pierre Ferragu","Yes. Is it better now?","Michael Sullivan","That is a little better. Let\u2019s try again.","Pierre Ferragu","Okay. Sorry for that. So, I was wondering how much of the revenues from deep EUV nodes where capacity is being added at the moment 7-nanometer foundry and [indiscernible] and 10-millimeter IGM and how much is coming from the EUV nodes ramping today?","Dan Durn","Yes. So, thanks Pierre. Let me take a stab at that and see if Gary wants to add anything. So, what I would say is, we won\u2019t share internal forecast of how foundry\/logic breaks out across nodes. But, I think, let me provide some color in context around the $1.9 billion. I think, we would say that we\u2019re seeing strong adoption at 7-nanometers as they build out the node, strong adoption node-over-node as 5 nanometers gets deployed from a capacity standpoint and the logic equivalence of that. And while we talk about a more balanced market in foundry\/logic, I think what you would see in the near-term environment that it\u2019s going to be significantly more weighted in the near term to these leading edge technologies. And so, we really like the way the business is performing node-over-node. In fact as we look out into 3 nanometers, we really like the position and we think we can significantly enhance our relative positioning node-over-node. So, we really like the way the business is performing on the leading edge. And what you see in the near-term environment, given the strong ramp around 5 and 7 nanometers is less balance in the market in the near-term, but the long-term trend of diversification within foundry\/logic is still intact.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Pierre, the only thing I would add relative to the leading foundry\/logic is that all of these customers are driving performance, power, area cost PPAC improvements. And that\u2019s really all about new materials, new structures to drive power and performance. And so, for Applied, as Dan said, really from a leading perspective -- leading node perspective, it\u2019s really -- it is those EUV nodes like 5-nanometer where you see that adoption. But still, we\u2019re achieving record revenue. We have so many opportunities when we\u2019re driving these new structures, new materials, new architectures, all of those different areas. So, we see record revenue there. We\u2019re also seeing growth, not only in transistor interconnect and patterning with some of our leading products, but we also have growth in areas where we have had lower share In etch, we have many new critical etch steps that we\u2019ve won, new soft line multi-patterning wins and EUV patterning steps where we really didn\u2019t participate in the past. So, we look at etch our business in foundry\/logic, we are extremely optimistic about the growth that we\u2019re seeing as new nodes are adopted even as EUV is also being adopted as one of the five drivers of power performance area and cost.","The other thing I talked about is in process control, we have continued strength in e-beam. We also have strong adoption of a new inspection tool, and we had record revenues in that market this last quarter. So again, it\u2019s really about driving that new playbook along those five vectors, power and performance are leading products. We\u2019re seeing new steps being adopted. And in some areas, we have room to grow, the opportunities for us to have never been better and our position has never been better than today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. I wonder if you could address the $300 million of kind of deferred revenue that pushes to next quarter. Can you talk about why that\u2019s happening? Is that just sort of issues with your customers getting up and running, is it logistics issues getting tools for them, or is it supply constraints that you have getting kind of sub assemblies to build tools? Just can you kind of tell us what\u2019s driving the deferral?","Dan Durn","Yes. Thanks, Joe. I think, the best way to describe it is, the actions China\u2019s taking to contain the spread of the virus has led to travel restrictions and logistics of moving things around the country. We see those impacts as being temporary, and it reprofiles revenue from Q2 to the back part of our fiscal year. And so, in the early stages of the China workforce coming back after the Lunar New Year and after the imposed restrictions by the government, we\u2019re seeing some early signs that are encouraging of some return to normalcy. So, fluid environment. It\u2019s too early to draw a conclusion from it, but we like some of the early indications that we see. We\u2019re going to continue to monitor the situation closely and update as necessary. And again, as we break out that 300, you rank order it, semi systems, display services. It\u2019s about getting our people into the factories and being able to service the equipment. That certainly puts some restrictions on it. We know Wuhan is an important geography in our display business, getting our systems into the factories in that region are impacted in the near term. And then, semi systems, it\u2019s more of the same. And so, we think that given everything we know, it\u2019s a prudent approach to the environment we see. We\u2019re going to continue to monitor it. There\u2019s an opportunity to do better in Q2. We think the customer demand is there, and we do think that we recover in Q3, Q4. And our full year, fiscal year outlook remains intact.","Joe Moore","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and for all the color you gave. A lot of questions are asked on the product side. I wanted to ask about services. Were you surprised to see the slowdown in services in the last few quarters? What drove that? And then, more importantly, let\u2019s say, you\u2019re targeting 15%, 20% growth for next year, how much does AGS need to grow for that or how much can AGS grow in that kind of a product growth environment? Thank you.","Dan Durn","Yes. Thanks, Vivek. So, as we look at services, we talked about the framework of growth in that business in the prepared comments. It\u2019s size of the installed base, it\u2019s complexity of the leading-node technologies, and it\u2019s the execution against the long-term service agreement opportunity we have. Those underlying growth drivers are absolutely intact. This is a business that\u2019s grown strong double-digits over the last handful of years. Q1 was a record quarter for us and significantly above seasonal. Q2 would have been our first $1 billion quarter. And so, the team is doing a great job executing. We also know the slowdown in the near-term is a function of the memory correction that we\u2019re seeing profile throughout 2019 as industry utilizations come down, our transactional component of the business has reflected what\u2019s happening to industry-wide utilizations. The team is still executing against the long-term service agreement opportunity and grew that business nicely in the mind-teens in 2019. What we like about the setup through the back half of the year and as we look into 2021 with the services business in particularly, as the memory recovery begins to take hold and as we look at that building momentum throughout 2021, foundry logic demand continues to be strong. Those are going to provide a nice tailwind for that business to grow into the back half of the year and into 2021. So, underlying demand drivers intact, team is executing well, and we like the profile going forward.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Just one more data point. I talked about in the prepared remarks. We added 15% increase in the tools under service agreements. And those -- that subscription type revenue is very sticky and also gives us a higher entitlement for tool. So, that\u2019s been a big focus. It\u2019s been a tremendous change in last few years, the significant growth. And it\u2019s really based on the value that we\u2019re providing our customers.","Vivek Arya","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Vivek. And operator, can we have just two more quick questions, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. I guess, I wanted to go through some numbers with you guys. So, you, I think you said a 19.2% of WFE last year. So, if I assume that the second half is flat versus the first flat, that would put SSG sort of in the $11.5 billion to $12 billion range. So, I don\u2019t think you would argue with either of those numbers since that\u2019 what you guided. So, if I use that and then I assume that you don\u2019t gain or lose any share this year, that would imply like a $61 billion WFE number, you\u2019re sort of saying we\u2019ll, it\u2019s probably going to be more like 57. So, if I just average those two and take 59 and if I try to figure how much revenue is required to support that much WFE, and I listen to what Gary said, which I totally agree with about WFE intensity that it usually peaks out at about 12%. So, if you take 12%, that would imply that you need over $500 million worth of semiconductor revenue this year, which would be up like 25% year-over-year. So, I definitely get that line YMTC is some of the incremental WFE, and they don\u2019t have much revenue. But how can you build a path to have enough revenue to support this? I guess, that\u2019s the question. It\u2019s just hard to see WFE growing off of this. It\u2019s going to take a long time for revenue to kind of grow into these WFE levels. Thanks.","Dan Durn","Yes. Thanks, Tim. I appreciate the question. So, a couple of things. We have insight in what we think our Sunday systems business can do against the backdrop of the environment we see. And we\u2019re very confident in our ability to significantly outgrow the market. And then, from a modeling standpoint, here\u2019s I guess how I would get at some of the assumptions. We think 2020 is going to be a really good year. We expect to outperform the market. One of the key variables in the model that you\u2019re putting together is what you assume for market share. And small changes in market share can make big differences in the model.","So, we see continued strength from foundry and logic in our business throughout the year. We\u2019ve got signs of memory recovery. And as we\u2019ve been saying for a couple quarters, ultimately, it depends on the magnitude and shape of the memory recovery later in the year. And if we see more momentum in that than we\u2019re currently planning for, then I do think that we have an opportunity to outperform in Q4 and into our fiscal Q1. And so net-net, we don\u2019t see this as being, an isolated pocket of performance. We\u2019re relatively balanced half over half. And we feel really good about our positions and how we\u2019re performing this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much for squeezing me in. Gary, maybe just a follow-up on the share position for Applied, both in terms of the customer spending mix, which is influential for you, as well as some of the competitive and design wins you talked about, process control being a record revenue year. How do you look at the next couple of years as I guess new products continue to be introduced, and additional competitive wins you believe can drive the Company on this outperformance?","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Thanks, Patrick. So, I would say, I\u2019ve never been more optimistic relative to the market. Again, you have new demand drivers that are layered on top of mobile, social media and PC. So, the market is going to be bigger than we\u2019ve seen in the past. And you can also see indications over the last few years the market is structurally larger and less volatile.","We have very good share spread across all of the different segments, leading foundry\/logic, we have momentum as customers are driving improvements in power, performance, area and cost. In specialty nodes, we have very, very strong positions, whether it\u2019s in image sensors or any of the other markets, like IoT, communication, auto and power, devices. So, we have strength there. We\u2019ve grown a significant amount in DRAM and in NAND relative to market share. Dan talked about this earlier. We\u2019ve grown several points over the last few years. So, we have very strong balance. And what I would say is, again, the path forward for the industry is really this new playbook around new architectures, new structures, new materials, new packages, also where we had record last year and we have strength and new ways to strength. So, we have the product pipeline and we have some very significant products in the pipeline that are targeted at multi-billion dollar types of opportunities. But, the other thing I would say that\u2019s really important is the combination of these different technologies with integrated materials solutions, driving significant improvements in throughput and drive currents or power, the things really that are crucial for the edge and the cloud. We have unique capabilities to combine these technologies, some of them under vacuum. So, you\u2019re not damaging interfaces electrically. So, that\u2019s another area.","We have engagements across every single customer with integrated material solutions. We have very good momentum there besides the current products we have and the products that we have in the pipeline. So, again from my perspective, I\u2019ve never been more optimistic. I spend a huge amount of my personal time with the R&D leaders for the customers through this entire ecosystem. They\u2019re struggling to drive the performance, power improvements that are needed. And I think Applied is in the best position that we\u2019ve ever been relative to our ability to drive our opportunities and growth going forward.","Patrick Ho","Thank you.","Michael Sullivan","Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks for your question. Dan, would you like to help us close the call?","Dan Durn","Sure, Mike. First, our sympathy is to everybody who has been affected by the coronavirus situation. I want to personally thank all of our employees who are helping their families and their communities while also taking really good care of our customers. Applied\u2019s outlook for 2020 remains really positive. We expect to deliver strong double-digit growth in our semi systems business this year, significantly outperforming our end markets.","Looking out into the future, I really like the setup. I really like what I see. Continued strong pull of foundry\/logic, improvement in memory, both of those elements are going to drive and fuel growth in our services business over time. I like what I see in display, increasing into the second half of 2020 and into 2021, and we expect to close the Kokusai transaction in the middle of this year. So, I really like the setup in 2020 and 2021. Gary and I hope to see many of you tomorrow at Goldman. And next week, I\u2019ll be on the East Coast and look forward to seeing many of you as well. Let\u2019s close the call, Mike.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, thanks. And we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today.

Please go ahead.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Mike Sullivan, Head of Investor Relations at Applied Materials. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied's current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions, and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of February 14, 2018, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them.","Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. I'm happy to report another record quarter for Applied, with revenue up nearly 30% from the same period last year. 2018 already looks like another great year, and we expect each of our three major business segments to deliver strong double-digit growth. We have tremendous momentum across the company and we are confident this momentum is sustainable for two reasons.","First, we see an expanding set of market drivers as more and more industries are disrupted by emerging technologies, from retail to entertainment, healthcare, manufacturing and transportation. The way companies create value and compete increasingly depends on their ability to capture, store and understand huge amounts of data. The overall market for electronics is increasing and, as those electronics get smarter, semiconductor and display content grows even faster.","Second, Applied is in a great position to outpace our markets. We are turning our investments into a strong pipeline of differentiated products, and we are using our broad set of capabilities to bring highly enabling new technologies to market faster than ever before.","In today's call, I'll talk about the major trends driving sustainable growth in our markets. I'll describe our strategy and how we're translating our broad portfolio of products and capabilities into differentiated performance for our businesses. Then Dan will provide details about our financial execution and capital allocation, which reflects our increasing confidence in the sustainability of our markets.","This is an incredibly exciting time in electronics industry because we are at the start of a new era of growth. The Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence will transform the economy over the next decade. As a result, a broad spectrum of companies are making substantial investments in these technologies to position themselves for the future. These large, powerful trends are already driving a fundamental shift in demand for semiconductors and displays.","While these are only the early stages of AI and big data, there are already applications that have significant traction and are starting to scale. The first example is AI Natural Language Processing which is being integrated into more devices and driving silicon content at the edge and in the cloud.","Voice assistants are fast becoming the hub for home automation. A typical voice assistant has around 30 chips and a total of 200 square millimeters of silicon, that's about twice the area of a smartphone application processor. Language processing is compute-intensive and the leading companies are building dedicated data centers to support it.","These AI workloads require new server architectures that have up to eight times more logic and four times more memory content by area than traditional enterprise servers. Another important AI trend for 2018 is neural processing units in smartphones. This is a great example of AI at the edge, where machine learning is used to enable a phone's camera to identify and react to what it's seeing.","The third example is self-driving cars. It's reported that $80 billion has already been invested as technology companies and traditional automakers race to get Level 4 vehicles to market. We believe Level 4 vehicles will have approximately eight times more silicon content than a standard car has today. These powerful emerging trends layer on top of traditional demand drivers, such as smartphones, data centers and storage, which continue to evolve and grow. We see leading cloud service providers announcing significant increases in their capital investments to expand data center capacity.","To keep pace with the explosion of data generation, the storage market is growing rapidly, and NAND is taking a larger share. Recent data suggests that NAND will grow from 18% to about 30% of the total data storage market in the next three years. And while smartphone unit growth is relatively flat, the value of the silicon content in smartphones grew more than 30% in 2017. All these demand drivers add up to a very positive outlook for Applied's served markets.","In Semiconductor, market fundamentals are strong, and we see disciplined investments in capacity and technology across a broadening customer base. Based on the timing of customer projects, we expect DRAM and logic spending to be higher in 2018, while the overall mix between foundry logic and memory investments will be similar to the 2017. We see a steady ramp of spending in China, which is positive for Applied because of our strong and growing market share and high service penetration at both multinational and domestic manufacturers.","At the end of last year, we expected total wafer fab equipment spending in 2017 and 2018 combined would be more than $90 billion. As we look further ahead, we believe combined spending in 2018 and 2019 could be around $100 billion. While it's too early to comment on timing of that spending, we believe the overall trend line is clear.","In Display, there are two equally large market inflections driving capital investments: the introduction of Gen 10.5 substrates for TV manufacturing and organic LED displays. In mobile, the transition to OLED displays is compelling. This is because rigid OLED offers significant performance, power and cost advantages over LCD, and flexible OLED will enable new form factors, such as curved and eventually foldable screens. As a result, our positive outlook for 2018 and beyond remains unchanged. Display is a unique growth driver for Applied, and we expect to increase our revenue by more than 30% in 2018 on top of nearly 60% growth last year.","At Applied, our vision is to make possible the technology shaping the future, and we have aligned our investments and our organization around this vision. It is increasingly clear that the breadth of our capabilities and product portfolio is an important source of differentiation because we bring together the most enabling capabilities in one place. We are in a unique position to help customers accelerate their time to market, which is tremendously valuable to them.","Against this backdrop, I'll now provide updates for each of our business segments. In calendar 2017, we grew our semiconductor process equipment business more than 40%, and our inspection and metrology business more than 10%. We expect to grow faster than these markets in 2018 and beyond with three major growth drivers.","First, in areas where we're traditionally strong, we are extending our leadership. Our leadership products create the materials that determine the power, efficiency and performance of devices. To drive the major advances in transistor and interconnect needed to enable high-performance computing and AI, customers are increasing their focus on innovative materials and structures. This is translating to significant growth in areas like PVD, where we grew revenues about $800 million in 2017.","Second, we're focused on capturing more share in markets where we have room to grow, specifically patterning, inspection and metrology. In patterning, we are providing materials-enabled solutions to customers' three most significant scaling challenges: resolution, the two-dimensional geometric shrinking of a device's features; 3D scaling, ways to increase transistor or memory cell density; and, increasingly important, placement, which is the vertical alignment between the layers of a device. By focusing on these key areas, we are on track to generate over $1 billion of patterning revenue in 2018. And regardless of EUV adoption, we expect our patterning opportunity to grow considerably over the next several years.","Management of placement errors is also a driver for accelerated adoption of our e-beam inspection technologies. E-beam is the fastest-growing segment in the inspection and metrology market, and we're on track to grow significantly faster than the market in 2018.","Third, we are finding new ways to combine our innovative technologies in materials deposition, materials removal, materials modification and materials analysis. Based on these capabilities, the pull from our customers for earlier and deeper collaborations is stronger than ever, and we're working with them to develop new solutions that accelerate their technology roadmaps and expand Applied's market opportunities.","In Service, on a year-on-year basis, we've grown revenues every quarter since the end of 2013. And we're confident we can continue to grow at least 15% per year. This sustainable growth is driven by: a growing installed base, an increasing number of tools under long-term service agreements, and advanced service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and rapidly optimize their factory output and operating costs.","Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. With record performance in the first quarter, 2018 is off to a great start. And we're confident we can deliver strong double-digit growth across our Semiconductor, Display and Service businesses. We see sustainable strength in our markets as new demand drivers, including IoT, big data and AI, layer on top of traditional computing and mobility. Applied is uniquely positioned to outperform our markets as we enable customers to accelerate their device roadmaps using our broad portfolio of products and capabilities.","Now, Dan will give his perspective on our financial execution and outlook, as well as provide additional color on our capital allocation.","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. I'd like to begin by sharing some of my observations about the environment Gary described and discuss how we plan to allocate the company's capital as a result. The semiconductor industry is fueling a new data economy. And today, we're already seeing record semiconductor industry revenue of over $400 billion. We're excited about the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, and we believe this next era of computing will be built out over the next decade or more. Of course, nobody can guarantee that the growth will follow a straight line, but the future we envision is nondiscretionary to the world's largest industries, and semiconductor process technology and systems are at the foundation.","All of the leading indicators of our equipment business are positive, and Gary shared that we see strength in 2018 and 2019. I believe WFE spending is going to remain significantly higher and less cyclical than it was during the PC era, which many people still identify with.","Consider these facts, 300-millimeter technology arrived in the year 2000 and gave customers 2.3 times the number of chips for every wafer. While semiconductor revenue grew, equipment spending actually declined between 2000 and 2013 as WFE intensity dropped from a peak of 17% to a low of 9% over that same time period.","But from 2013 to 2017, while semiconductor sales grew, wafer fab equipment grew even faster, and WFE intensity kicked higher to 12%. With technology getting more complex, I think it's hard to imagine WFE intensity drifting much lower.","So consider what happens if the semiconductor industry grows from today's levels at a modest 5% pace, as multiple forecasts predict. Then if WFE intensity stays flat at 12%, WFE investments of $50 billion or more should not be considered unusual in the near term, and spending could potentially reach $75 billion by the middle of the next decade.","We'll leave forecasting to others. The point I want to make is that demand is much broader today than during the PC area. WFE intensity has stabilized and the industry is likely to be a lot more attractive in the years ahead.","So, the future looks bright especially for Applied Materials because we have a growing Semi business, a growing Services business and a unique growth opportunity in Display. I believe Applied Materials will become larger and more profitable and generate significantly more free cash flow than we do today.","Against this backdrop, here is how we plan to deploy the company's capital going forward. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. Our first priority is to invest in the growth of the business with an emphasis on organic growth. We will continue to invest with discipline. This means every dollar of R&D is tied to an attractive margin target, and we will continue to look every quarter for opportunities to shift money from lower return areas to high return areas before increasing R&D. We will also stay laser focused on maintaining G&A efficiency.","Our second priority is to maintain a robust and flexible balance sheet. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade credit rating. Our third priority is to return excess cash to our shareholders. In fact, since 2000, Applied has returned nearly 90% of free cash flow to shareholders. And today, we're announcing a change in the dividend policy.","We've said that our markets are bigger and less volatile, which gives us the opportunity to pay higher dividends. Applied's Board of Directors has approved a 100% increase in the quarterly cash dividend and declared the first $0.20 quarterly dividend will be payable in June. We'll review our distribution practices on a regular basis and evaluate further dividend increases as we continue to grow the business.","At the same time, we strongly believe in the future growth and value creation of the company. Accordingly, the board has also increased our buyback authorization by $6 billion. Combined with more than $2.8 billion remaining from the previous authorization, we have a significant opportunity to increase shareholder value through buybacks. We plan to be opportunistic, repurchasing more shares when we believe they are significantly undervalued.","Next, I'll discuss the impacts of the U.S. corporate tax reform, which is beneficial to Applied because it gives us greater flexibility in how we deploy future profits to serve our customers, grow the company, and return capital to our shareholders. With freer access to profits generated offshore, we now have greater flexibility to invest within the U.S., where we do much of our advanced technology development and manufacturing. This year, we plan to add new engineering jobs in the U.S. and invest in new labs and office space to support our growth objectives.","In Q1, the new tax legislation resulted in a one-time repatriation tax of about $1 billion. As you may know, the tax amount is payable over eight years and the payments are significantly back-end weighted. Because of this one-time repatriation tax, Applied's GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 88.4%.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 6.3% for Q1, and we're using a 6.5% tax rate in our planning for the rest of fiscal 2018. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 12%. This increase reflects a minimum tax on foreign income that becomes effective next year.","Now I'll comment on our financial execution in Q1. We delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in both revenue and non-GAAP EPS, which was $1.06, or $1.02 when excluding a $0.04 tax benefit. On a year-over-year non-GAAP basis, we increased gross margin by 1.3 points, reduced OpEx as a percent of sales by 2.3 points and grew operating margin by 3.6 points.","Turning to the segments. We delivered record revenue and operating profit in both semi equipment and Services. In Semi equipment, we grew revenue by 32% year-on-year and delivered the highest operating margin in over seven years. I'm particularly impressed with the growth of our Services business. AGS grew revenue by 30% year-over-year, which was above our expectation mainly due to higher-than-expected spare parts demand. AGS also delivered record operating margin.","In Display, revenue and operating margin were both lower sequentially following a record Q4, which we anticipated due to lumpiness of the business. We expect Display revenue and operating margin to trend higher in the balance of the year.","Now I'll share our business outlook for Q2. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.35 billion to $4.55 billion. The midpoint would be up nearly 26% year-over-year. We expect Semiconductor Systems revenue and Services revenue to both increase by about 23% year-over-year, and our Display revenue should increase by about 48% year-over-year.","We expect the non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be approximately flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $755 million, plus or minus $10 million. At the midpoint, OpEx would be approximately 17% of revenue, down 1.4 points year-over-year. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.14, plus or minus $0.04. The midpoint of the range is up nearly 44% year-over-year.","And now I'll turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. Now, to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please just poll the operator and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our first question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on a strong beating rate. The first question for Gary, Gary, can you just talk about the mix of mobile versus TV in your unchanged 30% year-over-year outlook for Display business?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Atif. Just overall, again, in 2018, we're still seeing 30%, greater than 30% growth, and 2019 and beyond also look very strong. If we look at 2018, mobile versus TV, your question, it's about 50\/50 mix. In TV, we see increased adoption of larger screens. We're tracking 13 Gen 10.5 projects. And also, a great example here is on 65-inch TVs. If you produce them with Gen 10.5, you have eight 65-inch TVs, only three with Gen 8.5. So that's driving the TV business.","OLED is the other half of our business in 2018, and we still see very strong opportunity in OLED. Previously, we had one customer that was more than 50% of the business. Now, greater than 50% of the business is coming from multiple customers. We talked about 10 customers in OLED. And the transition to OLED displays is really compelling. Rigid OLED gives you better performance, faster refresh rates, power cost advantages over LCD. Flexible OLED gives you new form factors such as curved displays and eventually foldable screens. So again, we're on track for greater than 30% growth in 2018 and on track with our longer-term model.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Atif.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question for you around your capital allocation plan. Obviously, with the doubling of the dividend, you're feeling good about the sustainability of this heightened level of spending in WFE. Would be curious to hear your thoughts around your framework of returning that capital. You announced a buyback program that's now $8.8 billion. Would love to hear whether that is going to be opportunistic or systematic. Overall, would generally like to hear how you think about free cash flow generation and plans to return excess back to shareholders. Thank you.","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, C.J. Let me see if I can help you with that. So as you point out, we do see strength in our end markets. We're really encouraged by the diversification of those end markets. We're encouraged by capital intensity rising, and we're encouraged by the health of our customers. So we've got a strong view of our markets into the future.","From a capital allocation standpoint, the company's got a great history. Since 2000, the company has returned nearly 90% of free cash flow back to shareholders. As part of this announcement, we're changing the mix a bit. We're going to increase our dividend by 100%.","We've also announced a $6 billion share repurchase, when combined with the $2.8 billion that was outstanding from the prior authorization, gives us an opportunity to opportunistically be in the market to drive even more value for shareholders. And so we feel good about our end markets. We feel very good about the performance of the company. And we're going to remain committed to being very shareholder-friendly with our excess free cash flow.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. My first question is on the long-term drivers for the business. You talked about AI, IoT and the general data economy. Have you guys done any sort of work to figure out what portion of the business is currently being supported by these non-consumer markets?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","So, as we look into the end markets and what's driving WFE, what we see is a lot of confidence in macro trends that are going to be driving a significant amount of efficiency into very large industries, and we see that spend as non-discretionary. It is foundational to company's competitiveness. It's difficult to unpack those macro trends and slice them by WFE to see what part of WFE specifically supports each trend. What we see is a noticeably larger end market.","We see strength across all device types, whether it's logic foundry, whether it's memory. And within logic foundry, we see strength in both end markets. Within memory, we see strength in both NAND and DRAM. So we're really encouraged by the breadth of the strength we're seeing and we think it bodes well for the market. But I think it's too difficult to unpack specifically how much is attributed to which end market trend.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Farhan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon and congratulations on another well-executed quarter. Good to see the boost in the capital return program, and this goes back to your previous answer. But if I use net income as a proxy for free cash flow, this calendar year, you guys are going to be generating about $4 billion in free cash flow. So the dividend increase you guys announced today is going to consume about 20% of that free cash flow.","I guess, the question is, is the team committed over a multiyear period to its 90% free cash flow return, which would imply, at least for this year, about $3.2 billion in repurchase activity? And the reason why I ask this is that many semi companies and some of your peers are articulating capital return as a percent of free cash flow. So, I guess, the question is 90% of free cash flow, is that how we should think about the capital return commitment from the team on a go-forward basis?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Harlan. Let me see if I can add a little more color on this to try to be helpful. I would look at the 90% historical number as a mindset of this management team, as a mindset of Applied Materials, to be committed to getting cash back in the hands of shareholders. We're going to remain committed to that going forward.","I don't think what you will see from us is a formulaic approach to that. From a dividend standpoint, we made a big move on the dividend. We are going to continue to look at the performance of the business and the way we grow the business and review that policy on the periodic basis and look to grow our dividend as we grow the business. We're going to compliment that, the way we have historically, by being aggressive repurchasers of our shares when we feel intrinsic value is not fully reflected in the trading price of our stock. And we're going to continue to do that.","So, rather than be formulaic, I think we're going to look to be opportunistic with the repurchase, committed to the dividend, committed to reviewing that policy over time as we grow the business. And I think our track record into the future will be similar as our historical track record of getting a substantial amount of excess free cash flow back to shareholders. But we do not want to be formulaic in that approach today.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Harlan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Dan, you're guiding gross margin this quarter flat sequentially despite Display becoming a bigger percentage of your overall business, which I think historically would have been detrimental to gross margins. So, I guess, what's driving the fundamental improvement in gross margins? And longer term, you've shared the 47% target in your midterm plan. But we're kind of there. So how should we think about potential upside from there going forward? Thank you.","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Toshiya. So the company's got a really good track record over the last four years. Last four years, we've improved gross margin by 5 points. We've also articulated a model that says we're going to capture about 70 basis points of material costs of sales savings each year as we drive the business forward. That model still holds. But that's assuming a constant mix.","You rightfully point out that we're going to have composition of our business, the mix composition of our business that's going to create a bit of a headwind and mask some of that ornamental progress. So to see a quarter where we see strong sequential growth in Display and have us hold the gross margin flat I think is a reflection of all the hard work that's going on behind the scenes to continue to drive the profitability of the company.","What I would say is, our long-term model, we'd like to articulate a long-term model once a year during our Analyst Day and resist the temptation to update it along the way. What I would say is that we're going to be aggressive about looking for opportunities to do better than what we've advertised in our long-term model. And where we see opportunities, we will pursue it aggressively and make sure we're delivering as much value as possible for shareholders.","Given the mix of businesses and the growth profile going forward, we'd like to stay consistent with our 47% gross margin out into the 2020 timeframe. And if we have an update, we'll review it in the fall at our Analyst Day.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Toshiya.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I wonder when you talk about the $100 billion of WFE for the next two years versus the $90 billion you talked about for the next years 12 months ago, how much of that increment do you think is coming from which segment and how much is memory versus foundry logic? And is there a level where you start to feel like you start to worry about the supply growth being too high or just how are you guys thinking about these levels, because they keep kind of ratcheting higher?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Joe. So, implicit in the question is a framing that says we're ratcheting our estimates higher. What I would say is we're extending the range of our forecast out into the 2019 timeframe. And we feel really good about our end markets. What we're encouraged by is driven by three primary reasons. Macro trends, diversification of our demand drivers is the first. Second, capital intensity is up across the board, and that's all device types. And the third, customers are very, very healthy right now.","So just double-clicking on each of those three elements, we've got macro trends shaping how we live our lives right now. We've been thinking about it for a while I think probably back into 2016 timeframe at our Analyst Day. Artificial intelligence, big data, Internet of Things, autonomous driving, these are playing out. We view these trends as real. They're making an impact.","Demand for silicon is going up. Semiconductors are on the critical path of enabling each of these trends. Content in data centers is going up, content in edge devices is going up, and again, we're seeing strength across all device types. So the macro trends are incredibly favorable.","As we look at capital intensity, capital intensity is up across the board. In foundry, 7-nanometer is up 100% over 28-nanometer. Memory, both NAND and DRAM is up between 40% and 60% over that same time period. Foundry is three times more capital-intensive than the memory market. And we used to have wafer size transitions where you would get 2.3 times the number of chips per wafer, for instance, when you go from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter.","The last transition was at \u2013 in the year 2000. WFE intensity went from 17% in that year to a low of 9% in 2013 when all of the efficiency gains of that transition were absorbed. And from 2013 to today, we've seen it trend up from that 9% to 12%. And we don't have another wafer size transition on the horizon, so we feel really good about the capital intensity that underpins our markets.","And I guess, the third thing, customers are healthy. They're investing a lot of money to drive this growth into the semiconductor industry, but they're also making a lot of money. Their WFE spend as a percent of EBITDA is down. In 2012 to 2018, the three largest memory providers and the three largest foundry logic providers are all down 60% WFE spend as a percent of EBITDA.","So we're really encouraged by what we see. Macro is good, markets are good and customers are profitable. We think it's a really healthy market, we're encouraged by it.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Gary, in your prepared remark, you talked about some of that share gains you've generated over the past few years, particularly in patterning and e-beam inspection. A lot of it is due to the industry transition to 3D NAND and your ability to introduce some of the new products for that product. At the same time, we're seeing now the industry transition on the logic side to 10 and 7 nanometers. Can you discuss some of the opportunities there and maybe some of the share gain potential you have as that segment of the market makes a pretty sizable transition?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Sure, Patrick. Let me first start kind of big picture, and then I'll cover the question on the \u2013 that you asked. So, in 2017, we grew process equipment more than 40%. PDC grew about 10%. Now, if you look back over the last three years, 2014 to 2017, process equipment grew much faster than the PDC market. And we see that playing out in 2018, and probably in future years also.","But again, process equipment, very, very strong growth, and as you said, very strong balance for us. It used to be that, if it was a good foundry year, Applied would do well and not as well on the memory years. We've increased our share of memory about 7% over the last few years of total spending.","So, in 2017, we had very balanced share in all the different segments, device segments, around 20% or more in all of those different segments. And then what we're looking for 2018 is strong double-digit growth in our leadership businesses, in our growth businesses and also in PDC. PDC, we have new capabilities, new products that will increase our growth a fair amount above what we accomplished in 2017.","In foundry, there really are two big drivers. And one of those drivers is in the trailing geometries. There was question earlier about AI and what's driving AI. We really have data generation, many, many smart devices, data storage, and then you have the high-performance computing to process the information.","So, if you look at the trailing geometries, China is increasing investment in 2018 a fair amount both with domestic and global companies. We have a great position in China. It's one of our highest share positions in Semiconductor and Display. And we expect that we'll outgrow the market in China in 2018.","Patterning is a great opportunity for us. We've gained about 19 points of share in patterning over the last few years. If we look forward, patterning in 2020 will be about a $5 billion TAM. We anticipate that we could add another $1 billion approximately in revenue over the next four years in patterning.","And then if you look at scaling challenges, scaling, you have different drivers. One is resolution, two-dimensional shrinking of features. Their multi-patterning is growing. 80% layers are multi-patterning. Those are growing, and that's a great opportunity for Applied Materials. 3D scaling certainly happened in 2D to 3D NAND, but you also see that in logic. The contact over active gate is one example where you see that, and that's also materials-enabled scaling for customers. And certainly, you see that in high-performance computing and advanced foundry and logic.","And then another big industry challenge where we're in a great position, one of the biggest challenges for customers is pattern placement, the alignment of one layer to the next, edge placement errors. And there was a conference in early January; two of the top technologists from leading companies talked about edge placement errors being one of the biggest industry challenges. And what they said was that materials is the key driver for solutions to pattern placement. And if you look at our position with all of the selective technologies we have and materials technologies we have, we're in a very strong position to grow, especially in foundry, foundry and logic, as they move to these new technologies.","So again, overall 2017, we grew over 40% in process equipment. We see strong double-digit growth in all of our segments, leadership, growth, PDC. And the other thing I would say that we're seeing tremendous pull from customers is accelerating their roadmap. If they can bring those high-performance computing or AI chips to market faster, that's worth a tremendous amount of money and our ability to create, modify, remove and analyze materials is really unique. So we're seeing deeper engagements with customers than we've ever seen in the past, and I would say I've never been more optimistic about our markets and also our positions in those markets.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Patrick.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Sorry about the background noise. So I have a question about China. You guys sound pretty confident about investment by the local Chinese manufacturer, but these sort of new players, we haven't seen a lot of products coming out of there or even design come out of that. What gives you confidence that that investment will come maybe later this year or 2019, 2020 timeframe?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. So we have pretty significant visibility in China. We have the highest share. We also sell the manufacturing automation systems. So we have a lot of leading indicators relative to all the projects that are happening in China. And as I said earlier, we have the largest share and our share is growing in China, both in Semiconductor and in Display. And what we'll see in 2018 is a market that's going to grow. We're more optimistic, I would say, in terms of the growth in China. It's pretty balanced between global and domestic companies. And again, we're working very closely with all of those different companies.","Domestic China is higher in foundry and logic than it is in memory. And one of the things that we talked about was data generation, smarter devices, the increasing sensor technologies. That's an area where China has capability, and certainly the demand for those trailing geometries is now 40% of the foundry market and we're seeing very strong growth there in China. For the global companies, they are more weighted towards memory versus foundry and logic.","Another thing that Dan talked about in the prepared remarks was our service growth. I think something like 30% year-over-year in service. China is also a market where our penetration in service is very high, helping global and local of companies ramp new fabs in new locations. And so we had some one-time parts increases in our quarter that increased the rate of growth in service above the model that we gave. We think we may be a few points higher than that model, but that certainly contributed to an extraordinary quarter relative to service growth.","So anyway, we have very, very good visibility in China. The investments there are strategic investments, and we believe that that's going to remain a very good market and especially good for Applied Materials.","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yeah, I just want to build on very quickly the point Gary was making about our Services business. I think the way we profile this year from a service perspective will be different than we've seen historically because of the dynamic Gary talked about. I think you'll see a seasonally stronger first half and different profile into the back half of the year as a couple of these fabs facilitated by international customers are brought online in China.","I think the way to think about the back half of the year, because you've got visibility now on Q1 and Q2, think about the back half of the year, is take our long-term compound growth rate in our Services business of 15%. And as you look at full year 2018 revenue over full year 2017 revenue, we're likely to be about 3 points above our long-term compound growth rate. I think that gives you a good framing on how to think about the Services business throughout the course of the year so you can dial in your models.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Edwin.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. In terms of the growth you're expecting in display equipment this year, is this driven primarily by growth in your traditional display products or you're seeing \u2013 are you seeing meaningful new \u2013 meaningful growth from moving into new areas and increasing your addressed market in display?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","So, the display market in 2018 is roughly 50% TV and 50% mobile. And they're really with the same products that we have \u2013 had in the market previously. So no real growth from significant new products forecasted in 2018. And the mix is really about 50\/50 between mobile and TV.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. If you look back at the last calendar year, by my math, your Semi System business grew about 34%, which is obviously very impressive. And it's also just a few percentage points better than the WFE market. But the outperformance was much higher the year before. When you talk about your expected business to grow \u2013 outgrow the market again this year, do you expect that outperformance to reaccelerate this year?","Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, again, if you breakdown our business, the process equipment business grew more than 40% in 2017. PDC grew 10%. So it was more growth in terms of the process equipment business. If we look into 2018, we see strong double-digit growth really across all of those different businesses, the growth businesses, the leadership businesses, where we have extremely high market share, and also in PDC. So strong growth across all of them, strong double-digit growth across all of those businesses in 2018.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Sidney. And then, operator, I'd like to let you know that we've got time for about two more questions, please, if we have them.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our next questions will come from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the very good quarterly execution and the evolution and capital return. Gary, I just wanted to go back to the multi-year outlook and see if I could get some color from you just on how you're thinking about the potential for growth in 2019. I know it may be early to be real precise there, but it seems like a lot of the secular factors that are helping cause be uplift from where we've been as an industry to where we are now, we're multi-year in nature and they would seem to be as or more forceful next year. So any color on the potential for WFE growth next year would be appreciated. Thank you.","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Craig. I'll go ahead and jump in and take this. I think it's too early to tell how spending profiles across that two-year sequence. I think it's important to just take a step back and look at what's really driving our view on a multi-year basis. Macro trends are real. Capital intensity is up, and we're seeing modest and disciplined growth into China. Again, we think these macro trends shaping people's lives. We're in the early innings.","Gary referenced $80 billion of investments in autonomous vehicles. By 2020, eight OEMs are going to have Level 4 vehicles on the road. By 2022, it's 12 OEMs. We're in the early stages of SSD penetration of hard disk drives. And when we correlate it bottoms up with dialogue we have with customers, all indicators look good the best we can see, and fundamentals continue to look good into 2019. So while those trends we have a lot of confidence in, too early to call how revenue profiles over the forecast horizon.","Operator","Thank you. And your last question will come from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question on how you're thinking about the buybacks. You laid out a very positive long-term outlook. And if I do like a DCF around it, I can get like a very significant upside from where your share prices currently are. So, is it fair to think that you could be a lot more opportunistic with the buybacks and it could be more front half loaded if share prices are around current level?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Farhan. Like we said, we will be opportunistic with our repurchases. We've got a strong point of view on where the markets are going and how our company is performing within those respective markets gives us a lot of confidence in what the future holds for our business, more profitable, substantively higher free cash flow generation potential. And whenever we see disconnects in intrinsic value as we see it in our company and how we trade in the market, I think you'll see us be opportunistic with respect to those repurchases.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Okay, Farhan, thanks for the question. Let's see, Dan, anything you want to add before we close the call?","Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I think it's probably good to close with a couple of quick thoughts. Personally, I can't think of a better time to be in the semiconductor industry. We talked a lot about multiple growth drivers that are important trends shaping our lives. These trends are going to drive tremendous productivity and the investments are non-discretionary for some of the largest, most competitive industries on the planet. It is fundamentally about staying competitive.","Semiconductors are on the critical path of enabling those trends, and at the center of it, it all begins with what we do with Applied. When we bring all of this together, Applied's future is incredibly bright. Our breadth and depth is just an asset for the company. We are likely to be sustainably bigger, more profitable and we're going to generate more cash than in the past. And as we think about putting that cash to use, we talked about three important ways.","Number one, we're going to invest in new products. This is going to lead the way and drive the organic growth profile we've seen over the last few years. We will invest to drive organic growth. We will pay higher dividends and we're going to be buying back more shares to drive even more shareholder value going forward.","Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you. We're going to be at the Goldman conference tomorrow, and then next week and we'll be on the road in New York, Boston or Toronto. And, as always, thanks for joining us and we really appreciate the support.","So, Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.","Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.","Okay, great. Hey, thanks for that, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of our call is going to be available on our website by 5:00 PM Pacific Time today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Kyle. Today we'll discuss the results for our third quarter, which ended on July 26. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied's current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions, profitability, and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections, and assumptions as of August 13, 2015, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them.","Today's call also includes non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investors page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon.","At our recent analyst event at SEMICON West, we outlined how Applied Materials is focused on delivering profitable growth. Overall, the company is executing well, as seen in our third quarter results, where we delivered our highest quarterly earnings in the past four years, the highest service revenue in our history, and more than $2 billion of 300-millimeter semi equipment orders, which is also a record.","While progress towards our strategic goals and financial model remains on track, changes in the business environment over the past few weeks have created some near-term headwinds. Looking at the market as a whole, we now see 2015 wafer fab equipment spending being approximately flat relative to 2014, with potential downside risk. The most substantial revision to our outlook is foundry spending, where we have lowered our estimates for the remainder of the calendar year. This is primarily due to customers managing excess inventory, improving their yields, and reusing equipment.","While we see a pause in capacity additions, the leading foundries are still aggressively pursuing 10-nanometer technology, and we expect this to become a key battleground in 2016 with the buildout of pilot production. As we have discussed before, the 10-nanometer node expands the available market for Applied and plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses. With the majority of development tool selections already made, we are confident about our growth opportunities at this node.","In logic, we do not see any major changes to our previous outlook, and the cadence of our development roadmap remains tightly aligned with our customers' needs. In memory, 2015 continues to be a year of strong investment. DRAM bit growth is in the 20% to 30% range, with supply and demand more or less balanced. We maintain our view that 2015 DRAM spending will be around 20% higher than last year, driven by 20-nanometer upgrades and some capacity additions.","Most significantly, we are increasingly optimistic about the pace of the transition from planar to 3D NAND. Our customers are telling us they are under significant pressure to ramp this technology faster because of its performance and reliability advantages. Consequently, we see the buildout of 3D broadening and accelerating.","We expect installed capacity will now surpass 150,000 wafer starts per month by the end of calendar 2015. While this number is higher than anticipated at the start of the year, it only represents around 15% of total NAND capacity. These are still the early phases of the buildout. And as the adoption of 3D NAND speeds up, it will become a more meaningful driver of Applied's growth.","Our NAND orders were at an all-time high this quarter, and we expect our combined etch and CVD share at these customers to grow between seven and 10 points during the 3D NAND inflection. 3D NAND is also enabling us to expand the available market for our epi products by between 5% to 10%.","In display, the shift to 4K TVs and larger average screen sizes is sustaining area growth in the 10% range, which supports ongoing investment in new TV capacity.","In mobility, our customers continue to invest in LTPS for high-resolution screens, and the penetration of OLED displays is ahead of our prior forecast. We now believe that around one in five smartphones shipped in 2015 will use OLED technology. Currently, mobility makes up a large part of industry investment, and this spending mix is not as favorable for us. When combined with a weak yen, our display business faces some margin pressures over the next few quarters. However, the overall market trends are positive, and we are on track to grow in line with our financial models.","As we discussed at SEMICON, the entire Applied organization is focused on delivering for our customers and shareholders. Our strategy and investments are aligned so that Applied is in the best position to address major materials innovation challenges in semiconductor and display. We have developed a very strong product portfolio targeting key inflections and are demonstrating significant traction with new products.","Our Etch Sym3 chamber that we officially launched last month is one of the fastest ramping products in Applied's history. And by the end of our first quarter of 2016, we expect to have shipped around 450 chambers. This product is enabling us to grow our overall etch market share, and this year we believe we are adding to the seven points of gains we made between 2012 and 2014. In the past few weeks, we secured major application wins in 3D and patterning, giving us increased confidence that we will continue to make gains in 2016.","We also have very strong pull for our Olympia ALD tool, as customers are telling us that ALD film quality is one of their top issues for 10-nanometer device performance. We are expecting to ship more than 50 chambers by the end of our first quarter.","Our service business is also delivering profitable growth. Our AGS revenues were at record levels again this quarter, and 2015 remains on track to be the biggest year in our history. We have made some significant improvements to our service business and aligned our strategy to enable customer success. We have brought together capabilities from across the company so that we can deliver and capture more value with our service products. We believe that this momentum is sustainable, and service is a meaningful component of our long-term strategy for profitable growth.","While we are maintaining investment in development programs that support our strategic priorities to increase share in wafer fab equipment, grow our service business, and expand our total available market, we are equally focused on reducing operating costs and the complexity of our organization. We recently made enhancements to Applied's structure that will enable us to accelerate those opportunities that are most critical to our growth. By aligning the organization around key areas of value creation, we are improving the way we collaborate with customers and speeding up the delivery of new products and services to meet key technology inflections. In parallel, as we navigate the near-term industry environment, we remain highly focused on managing our expenses and financial performance. We are carefully prioritizing R&D investments while reducing discretionary spending.","To provide you with more details about the actions we are taking as well as our financial results and outlook, let me now hand the call over to Bob.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Gary. Good afternoon and thank you for joining today's call.","Applied delivered strong results in the third quarter, posting our highest revenue in the past three years. Over this period, we have repositioned the company to capitalize on key inflections in foundry, logic, and memory and increase our share of WFE. As Gary has already mentioned, our strong position in foundry will drive further growth when 10 nanometers ramps next year. I'll take a moment to summarize how the changes we've made to our strategy and investments have improved our position in today's memory-driven environment.","We expect memory spending to make up nearly 50% of WFE in 2015 compared to less than 25% in 2012. Over the same timeframe, Applied's memory revenue is on track to grow by more than 150%. We are significantly outpacing the market and believe we are gaining four points of market share in both DRAM and NAND.","Within NAND, the 3D inflection is gaining momentum with a broader set of customers. Based on new product positions across the customer base, our share of 3D NAND spending is now approaching the high levels of share we have in foundry.","At the product level, our substantial investments in etch and CVD are having a positive impact on our results. This past quarter, we secured our second highest etch orders in the past 15 years as well as our highest CVD orders ever. Importantly, through our strong engagements with customers, we have developed a deep pipeline of new and disruptive products that give us further opportunities for share gains and profitable growth as semiconductor and display technology inflections play out over the next several years.","Now I'll comment on our third quarter results. Revenues of $2.5 billion were up 10% year over year. Non-GAAP gross margin of 43.9% was slightly higher than expected, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 was at the midpoint of our range. We used $625 million to repurchase 32 million shares of stock, deploying more than 20% of our three-year, $3 billion buyback authorization in the first quarter of the program. We will continue to be opportunistic with the buyback. Including dividends, we returned nearly $750 million to shareholders.","Next I will make some comments on our segments. Silicon system orders of $2 billion were up 18% sequentially and set a record. This performance was led by strong 3D NAND momentum across multiple customers, notably in Japan where revenue is recognized upon sign-off. Backlog was at an eight-year high, net of an $84 million reduction due mostly to an order cancellation in foundry. We also significantly reduced our Q4 foundry forecast. AGS posted a second consecutive quarter of record revenue and remains on track for a record year. Display orders more than doubled sequentially, including a large order for our new CVD encapsulation tool for OLED displays.","Next let me provide some additional insight into our gross margin and OpEx patterns. Over the past two years, we have made significant progress with our gross margins. But this year, we are experiencing headwinds due to mix effects and the higher initial cost of new products. As Gary explained, overall WFE demand is trending lower versus earlier forecasts, with memory higher and foundry lower. We are seeing exceptionally strong pull for our new semiconductor products. And in display, our revenue mix is rapidly shifting to mobile.","Taking these factors into consideration, we are modeling Q4 non-GAAP gross margin to be down by about two points sequentially. We are driving actions to improve gross margins, particularly for our new products in high-growth markets.","We are also reducing our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx was $576 million in Q3. In Q4 we plan to reduce it to $555 million plus or minus $10 million. We took further actions in solar, where we discontinued our wafer saw and solar implant product lines, resulting in one-time charges of approximately $51 million in the third quarter.","In summary, 2015 wafer fab equipment spending is trending lower than our prior expectations. Our focus on technology inflections and new products is producing revenue and share growth opportunities, notably in memory. But the demand mix presents gross margin challenges in the short term. Over the model horizon, we expect the mix to return to levels that are more consistent with historical patterns and more favorable from a gross margin perspective. In the meantime, we are heavily focused on gross margin improvements and operating expense reductions.","Now I will provide a fourth quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to down 7% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect silicon system net sales to be down 6% to 12%. AGS net sales should be approximately flat. We expect display net sales to be up by 25% to 35%. And EES net sales should be approximately $55 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.31.","Now I will turn the call over to Mike for questions.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Kyle, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. Just regarding the October quarter, I wanted to probe you on the order trends. It seems that the revenues are declining despite very strong orders that you had in the July quarter, so I'm thinking there is probably a 25%-ish decline in the October quarter. This is the orders, so I just wanted to probe you. What segments are you seeing the decline? And considering that you have very strong orders in NAND, I just wanted to understand how sustainable are the order trends. Do you think that they are peaking in July, or do you think just because we are now in the 3D era, we will just start to see much higher order run rate in NAND?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, let me take a shot at it and Gary can join in. We had really strong orders in Q3, so you might say shouldn't your revenues be a little stronger in Q4? As you go look at our press release we put out today, we get a fair amount of orders in Japan, in fact. And in Japan, we recognize revenue usually a quarter after we ship. So some of the orders we booked this quarter will trail into the next several quarters in terms of shipments and revenue recognition. So that's a little bit of a disconnect between our strong orders this quarter and the revenues, which are a little less robust next quarter but give you higher than typical backlog from this quarter that we'll sustain into Q1.","The second thing in terms of what's our outlook, I'll give you my observations. I think you have a couple of different things going on. In V-NAND, which I think more and more people are resonating, there's a lot of momentum around that for several reasons. One, there's more and more data that suggests that the V-NAND flash device is a superior device in terms of performance. And then the second thing is you can't sustain planar shrink effectively. So the push to go to V-NAND is picking up momentum if anything.","And the second aspect to that is that that is particularly good for Applied on many levels. The first is that V-NAND is much more deposition, etch, RTP, CMP, and even some epi intensive than 2D. The second thing is the tool mix is somewhat different, so the level of reuse for us is much less. So we actually do say, and I believe it's very accurate and you're starting to see it in the bookings, that the opportunity for Applied from the planar shrink mode, which was primarily reuse, and most of the incremental CapEx might have been tilted toward lithography to a V-NAND mode where a lot of it is not available for use, is about a 3x revenue opportunity for Applied. So that's my outlook that I think V-NAND bullish on for a while, including next year.","In terms of foundry, we are saying we're seeing it a little softer. In fact, one of the significant reasons why our gross margins in Q4 were down and less than we expected even a couple months ago was that the mix has changed on us. We're seeing strong memory, but we're not quite seeing the foundry we might have anticipated. And we had to scratch our own heads on that because how does that tie to the outside world? What we're coming up with is that the things that have been talked about in the last couple months in the outside world; that is, customers are reusing equipment more effectively and efficiently, particularly as they bought a little conservatively to have very good ramps for their customers in the foundries in the last year or two, that tool reuse is creating a little bit of a slowdown at this point. Now that doesn't mean we think it's not positive next year, but they're more effectively using those tools they bought earlier in the cycle.","And the second thing we read about and hear about, they're continue to improve yields. They're continuing to improve tool utilizations quite high too. So what we see in foundry is, in our fourth quarter, it's less than we anticipated. And we even saw, as we mentioned in my notes, that we had about an $8 million push-out of a foundry booking \u2013 or a cancellation rather.","Now what does that mean prospectively? We're not pessimistic on foundry at all. The question is when do they, A), get through this full utilization of some of these tools. And two, how does 10-nanometer do? So we haven't spoken to November \u2013 December yet, but we are relatively positive actually on next year on 10-nanometer. And for Applied specifically, the mix of tools at 10-nanometer is very positive. I think we have about a 20% to 30% bigger opportunity. And as we get through this reuse gap, that should help us on our revenue, our share, and our gross margins, frankly. But that's what we're getting through.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. And just looking at the stock repurchases, you had $625 million of stock repurchases, which is quite a bit higher than what we would have expected at your $2 billion in first year \u2013 sorry, $2 billion worth run rate. With the stock where it is, could you be more opportunistic in the near term?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Mechanically, let me tell you how we do this. At the beginning before we started the stock buyback plan, we put together a thoughtful \u2013 I hate to call myself thoughtful, but I think it was thoughtful, the Treasury department was, a matrix, and what you do is a buyback grid. And you see at various stock prices we will buy various dollar prices per day, and that pricing grid has given a lot of analysis to long-term valuation of the company in terms of net present value, intrinsic value, short-term valuations versus multiples and earnings. And when you cross certain price points, you buy more stock back. And the stock went down this quarter, and it triggered that more aggressive buyback.","At the end of this quarter we will revisit with our board the price grid and the volume grid, and we'll reset it or not. You don't typically reset them a lot because a lot of the valuation there is what do you think the intrinsic and long-term value of the enterprise is. So my guess is that our pricing grid as it exists gives us fair amount of flexibility to be aggressive at the type of stock prices we're seeing. And I think that would naturally lead us to be opportunistic because we see long-term value in the company.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you, that's all I have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, guys, thanks, good afternoon. On the foundry issues, obviously I think the questions from the market are going to be are the foundry issues cyclical or secular, and obviously you addressed a little bit of that. And then the other question I think clients will have is how do we know it's not share loss because I think some other companies have reported and they haven't seen these declines to this extent. Maybe it's a calendar issue where you guys are a month later and you've seen it, but obviously those will be the questions. So could you help us on the secular versus cyclical versus the share loss question that I'm sure will come up tomorrow?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. If you go look at secular versus cyclical, I think some of it's timing and some of it other people have talked about it. You see our customers talking about it. We're getting higher tool utilization. Samsung talked about it earlier in the year. TSMC has started to talk about that, higher tool utilization, more tool reuse. So that's across \u2013 and even inventory in the channel, you see some data on that. So I think what you have right now is a problem in fuller utilization, more efficient utilization of tools. Now I think they're getting through that. You might argue could we have seen some of this? Maybe, higher tool utilization, greater reuse of tools, it's hard for us to measure it because it factors in with yield and all that stuff, which we have no insight to. So I think there's a good part of this that is a cyclical thing, this window we're in here.","In terms of why do we see it and other people aren't talking about it, we are a month later, number one. Number two, if you do look at the mix of Applied tools, sometimes they're about a little bit earlier and heavier in a cycle. For instance, our epi tools take a while to qualify. They're complex tools, and customers bought a little heavier earlier. PV tools tend to be back-end interconnect to a lot of that stuff, so these tools get bought a little bit earlier. And then if you look at tools like that, our share is very strong and our tools are enabling in those areas. So there is no share loss there and we're seeing some volumes down there, frankly.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think also, Jim, if you look at it from a market share perspective, in foundry, that's our strongest position. Now the good news is that as the memory business is ramping, also our share is up. Bob talked about this earlier, several points in memory, so that's helping us offset some of the weakness in the foundry business.","But if you look at our leadership products, we talked about this at Investor Day. We're up 5% in the leadership products over the last couple years, launching some great new products in those areas. And so that combined with our momentum in the etch business with the Sym3, highest ever CVD orders, new ALD position, we look at our position for 10-nanometer, and we're very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow share in foundry. Right now the mix is working against us in terms of foundry versus memory. The good news again is we have gained share in memory. We have good momentum there, but we also have a very strong position in foundry.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Jim, I'll tell you another way you can triangulate on what we're saying. We have two primary U.S. competitors. One is generally thought of as more memory centric; one is thought of as more foundry and logic centric. And if you look at it, the person who is more memory centric probably a month ago saw a little bit better outlook than we did. And the one who is more foundry and logic centric saw a significantly less optimistic, I believe, outlook than we did. And because we've repositioned the company, we're more closely towards the memory, whereas if you looked a couple years ago we were more closely to the foundry model. So I think, one, if you look at our peers and say what is our positioning in those, we're somewhere in the middle, but we've moved a lot more holistically towards good representation in memory too. But if you think about those two other companies too, it makes sense.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And so maybe as a follow-up, picking up on that point, I know and I think everybody in the market knows that you guys are incredibly well positioned in 3D NAND, and it will be a good really positive inflection for you all. And I believe you're gaining share in the other segments, as you commented. At what point is it fair for us to look at the company's revenue on a year-over-year basis versus the overall industry revenue and see those share gains coming through? Is the idea that that's just going to be a little bit further out where we can look at Applied's revenue growing significantly in excess of the overall industry growth rate to measure that share gain in the company-specific results?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You have some indicators. I'll try and then Gary will jump in. You have some indicators now, Jim, that aren't too bad. People have said this year is \u2013 different people said different numbers, but some people have said $33 billion WFE. We haven't updated it, but we're a little bit more conservative than that, frankly.","And so if you look at that, we had record orders this quarter. I think in SSG we're going to be close to a record for the year in orders in semi. I don't know if we'll be exactly there, but we're in pretty damn good shape. If you look at our service businesses, which implies that we're servicing more tools, that's a record, and display is pretty good. Now you're talking mostly about semi. If you look at share within product, it's up. If you look at WFE share, the last couple years it has been up. So there are some existing indicators. And then as we said at Analyst Day, we have some product positioning stuff that's going out.","Now a little bit of wind at our back; it was a good foundry in the last couple years, so I'll give you the math that's in my head. If you look at the \u2013 it's $7.7 billion or $7.8 billion, whatever the number is, between $7.5 billion and $8 billion for both DRAM and NAND this year WFE. We've gained over four points on each I think. And so if you take four points times $8 billion, that's about $320 million each that if we hadn't repositioned ourselves we'd be short $640 million there. Two years ago we had $2 billion in semi, services in AGS. This year we'll be close to $2.6 billion, and a couple hundred million dollars of that is positioning. So I think through the repositioning will company and the products we have in the pipeline, you can see more robust revenues arguably with this mix of probably $600 million, $700 million, $900 million.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you so much.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ada Menaker - Evercore ISI","Hi, this is Ada calling in for C.J. Could you guys talk a little bit about how the economics for AMAT changed in memory in 2016 given that more of the DRAM CapEx will be spent on shrinks as opposed to new wafer starts, and in 3D NAND on new wafers and conversions as opposed to largely greenfield in 2015?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","What was your point? Say it again about 3D. What did you say about 3D?","Ada Menaker - Evercore ISI","In 3D, next year is going to be more new wafers and conversions and this year is more greenfield. What does that do to the economics for you guys?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think on 3D NAND, I'll start and then Bob can join in. Thanks for the question. So 3D NAND, as we have talked about before, is really more materials-enabled than litho-enabled scaling. So if you look at the CapEx that is necessary for them to ramp those devices, it's very heavily weighted toward CVD, etch. Also, we have epi there for the first time in memory where we have a very strong position. So as the customers are ramping those 3D NAND factories, the areas that are growing are the areas where we are gaining share. That's part of what Bob talked about earlier, where he said we're gaining several points of share in 3D NAND.","And if we look at the products that we're introducing, the Sym3 Etch, the record CVD orders, again, a number of our products are very well positioned as the customers ramp 3D NAND spending. So we believe that 3D NAND is at about 15% of the total NAND capacity. We believe that that is going to continue to ramp in 2016 as a percentage of total spending, and we're in a very, very, very strong position there. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that's true. I think the big inflection that's going on in the industry right now is 3D NAND, and it's going to go on for years. There are about 1.3 billion wafers out there. There's about 150 million by the end of this year that are done. I think that's a bigger inflection than DRAM.","Within DRAM, we're a little bit more bullish than somebody like Dataquest. We see that they didn't really add that much capacity this year. If you look at die sizes, they're bigger, if you look at more process steps, so they didn't really add that much capacity this year. So we're a little bit more bullish than some of the outside folks on total DRAM spending next year. And then as we mentioned earlier, our position in DRAM, in the last couple years we gained four points.","Ada Menaker - Evercore ISI","Great, thank you. And can you maybe just dive a little bit deeper into gross margin and how much of the headwind is coming from display versus how much is coming from SSG?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Display is a good size gross margin headwind now. It could be up to a point for the company. And what's going on there is historically for many years, 80% and even a few years ago 90% of our business in display was for TVs, equipment for making displays for TVs. We project that next year over 50% will be for small screens, so your cell phone and stuff. So the good news is, if you go back a few years ago, if TVs had turned down like this, we'd be losing a lot of money in display because there would be no revenues. In fact, we think revenues will be pretty strong next year in display because over 50% of our business will be small screen sizes and that we are growing the TAM there. This is the third year in a row we have grown display revenues, but next year with the TV downturn we're still pretty damn healthy.","So the issue is gross margins there. So if you look at that, we're penetrating some new products in some new markets, and some of our new competition is Japanese yen based. So the display thing is bad probably through the first couple quarters of fiscal 2016, but it gets a little better each quarter and then we pick it up, and that's when our mix gets more normal. We start to get some TV business back and the product mix changes a little bit. It's about a point now.","The other piece is SSG, where the big mix delta for us is foundry versus memory, and that's really just indicative of the tool mix. And the tool mix is stronger for us right now, things like etch and memory, whereas in foundry we're a little stronger in places like epi, PVD, inspection.","Ada Menaker - Evercore ISI","Great, thank you so much.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my question, two of them. First one, Bob, to follow up on the gross margin side, so if your January revenues might come up because of the Japanese revenue recognition, should we assume gross margins will still be under pressure given the fact that display is going to continue, and so would SSG pressures? In other words, would revenues improve in January sequentially but margins be under pressure? And then I also had a follow-up.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, so just to give you the economic model of Applied Materials, in some industries if volumes go up, gross margins naturally benefit because they get absorption issues in their factories. A company like Applied Materials and our peers, predominantly our product cost is materials, stuff we buy, so you don't get this big absorption boost or downtick either with volume. So our gross margins are predominantly a function of mix, mix between customers, mix between products. So I don't have a clear view on the Q1 yet. But given I've got pretty good backlog right now, I'm concerned that the mix issues we're seeing in Q4 will stay into Q1 and we'll have the same type of challenges in Q1.","Now if you say, Bob, what have you been saying all along? I think last quarter and even maybe at Analyst Day, I was somewhat concerned about exactly this issue, frankly, in fiscal Q1 and Q2, the heavy volume of etch and the display mix with small screen sizes. What's been a little bit different for us is Q4 I thought would be a little bit heavier foundry mix than it turned out to be.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then the follow-up is you guys had almost just shy of $800 million in NAND bookings in July. Is there any way to parse it to say how much of that was 3D NAND?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, there is. NAND ramp is going up significantly towards 3D each quarter. I'd say \u2013 let me see if I have it here. We're looking for the data, but my guess is that in the quarter we just ended, the great majority of it was 3D.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. Bob, I guess my first question is again on gross margin. It really isn't different than it was a few years ago at this revenue level. And I certainly get the new product issue and the mix items and the flat panel issues. But people are going to say \u2013 they're going to say look, they're just buying market share or they're gaining unprofitable low-end share. So I just wanted to give you a chance to say hey, that's not what's actually happening here because that's what people are going to say. And I guess maybe just talk about where gross margin would be a year from today at this revenue level once you normalize all these factors out. Then I had a follow-up, thanks.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, thanks for the question, Tim, a couple of things. I had tasked our internal people with the same question to make sure it's not happening, so let me see if I can go through the details because I've been through the details. As I was just asked, one full point of it in the short term is display. In display, you're not hearing that from display competitors of us. It's mostly mix. You can see we're selling a lot more into the small screen sizes, a little bit more in PVD, for instance, than CVD. So it's definitely mix in there. Does it make it a little worse that our competitors are Japanese? Maybe, but mix is the biggest single delta in there.","The second issue is semi, where you hear more contrarian views from other people. So I went through \u2013 the biggest delta is mix between some of our higher gross margin products, our PVD, epi, and inspection. And so some of the lower ones for us are etch. So you could see the mix is more weighted towards foundry for the first, and for etch it's more weighted towards memory. And you see the foundry\/memory mix happening, so you know we're getting a bigger mix.","So then you'll drill into me and say are you being hyper-competitive on etch, for instance? So I went through by deal what we've been doing in etch cost, the pricing. And our prices were \u2013 our peers, our competitors were very much the same type of prices, arguably higher. So what we've got there is a cost issue and a mix issue. Our competitors have a different mix of products and, frankly, they have a more mature product. So what we have to do is get cost out in our products and start to get the mix across all of our products. So the roadmap for us is let's get some more normal level of mix between memory and foundry. And particularly within foundry, let's get the normal level of things like epi, PVD, inspection. And then with etch, let's get our costs down and continue to get costs down and configurations down.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks a lot for that. And then I guess really for you, Gary, this is a big-picture question, but it really is about your thought process around really shaking things up a little bit. The stock has certainly underperformed. If you look at the next worst peer, it's underperformed the next worst peer by 1,000 basis points over the past six months. I know that much of that is due to the failed merger, but you can't be happy with that. I guess my question is about really shaking things up, maybe cleaning off some of the businesses, maybe pulling in the buyback, maybe getting out of some big markets you're in that are not as high margin, really a question around your thought process around that because the stock has significantly underperformed I think even your expectations. Thanks.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we outlined the strategy at the investor meeting. As Bob talked about, we've been positioning the company around the major inflections. So if you look at the way we structured the organization, the way we move the investment within the company in patterning, for instance, in etch and CVD, we've got the highest CVD orders ever in the history of the company; etch, the second highest orders in the history of the company this last quarter. And our memory share is increasing. So we look at each of these different markets and really try to figure out, like you talked about, what moves the needle. Where are we going to invest? How are we going to structure the company around those inflections so that we're positioned when those new devices ramp? So patterning, again, tremendous momentum there. We talked about the 450 Sym3 chambers. It's really from in a five-quarter period of time we're going from 18 chambers in the field to 450.","And you asked the question about the margins relative to buying market share. We're winning in critical applications with a higher price than the competitors in many of the cases where Bob and I went through the analysis. So there are some real technical advantages of those products that, again, we went through some of those at SEMICON. So it's focusing in this patterning inflection, focusing around the transistor and interconnect area. As 10-nanometer technologies ramp, we're in very, very strong DTOR positions.","In service, we also made a number of changes there to really drive higher value and lower cost in our service business. And we believe as these inflections happen for our customers, these are tough inflections. They have to ramp quickly, get to high yield fast. And so that's another area that we focused on where we've seen hundreds of millions of dollars in growth. And we really believe that that's another area where we fundamentally repositioned the company for more sustainable growth going forward into the future. And then, as Bob talked about in display, a few hundred million dollars of growth there, expanding as our customers move into some of these new technologies like OLED within film encapsulation. So we believe all of those areas are fundamentally stronger than where we've been in the past around all those different segments of the business.","Now the other thing that we did is we cut $400 million of OpEx. We cut G&A by about 25%. We've cut many areas that were low performing. We continue to look for those areas. We talked about some other businesses that we're ramping down right now, and we will continue to look for those lower performing businesses. Anything that we don't see that is going to be a good return and generate somewhere around at least a 20% operating profit, we have zero bias about being in those businesses.","So from a top level standpoint, we've moved the money. We've structured the company around the areas that we believe will move the needle for Applied and for our customers. And the model that we presented at SEMICON, the $2.00 model, we believe we're on track. If you look at the indicators around the major areas of our business, we are gaining share. Now the mix in the near term \u2013 you look at that long-term model. But the mix in the near term, the foundry versus memory, mobility versus TV, those are things that are headwinds for us. But fundamentally we're in a much better position and confident that we're going to achieve that model.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, Gary. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you. You guys have mentioned that WFE this year, your expectation now is that it's flat, but the risk is to the downside, and I wonder. How does the weakness this year change your view on spending for 2016?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll take a shot at that; Gary can jump in. We think some of the weakness we're seeing towards the end of this year is this tool reuse, increasing yields, and absorption of the capacity they have, as they go into foundries in particular because memory is pretty strong. DRAM was strong at the beginning of the year. We're more bullish than your average outside guy for next year DRAM. In NAND, I don't think anyone is too pessimistic right now. We're optimistic, actually. So it's a discussion on foundry spending and timing.","So if you go look at it, we believe that in listening to our customers, 10-nanometer is going to be a pretty big spend year for them next year. So the rough mathematics is that if you look node to node, so the 32-nanometer to 28-nanometer versus 2016 14-nanometer versus 10-nanometer, wafer starts might be down a little bit, maybe 10% per launch, but capital intensity per node is up about 20%, so the volume versus capital intensity is still not bad. I think the problem we have right now is we get this reuse.","Now the other thing you have to go look at is all the macro stuff, which is beyond my pay grade. What's going to happen in China in phones and the next Apple phone? I don't know that stuff. But in a reasonable demand environment, the increasing capital intensity and the importance of 10-nanometer to our customers and the fact they're absorbing the tools at this point means it's probably okay.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","If the PC and the smartphone TAMs remain under some pressure, Gary, are you more inclined to pursue growth via acquisitions?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that from a top-level standpoint, we are improving our position in memory, so that's the good news. If you look at the point, the share gain that we have in both DRAM and flash, that's helping us offset some of the near-term weakness in foundry. So for us to hit the financial model, you have to believe that the mix comes back to some normal relationship between the foundry and the memory, and we think that's going to happen. But certainly, if you look at our position in epi, PVD, implant, thermal products, CMP, you have to have a more normal mix than we've seen over the last few years for that part of our product portfolio to work. So mix certainly plays a big role in the overall financials.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So I just want to be clear on this point. Is it fair to say that M&A is no longer part of the company's growth strategy?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So M&A, basically what we've said is there are three things that drive our M&A strategy. Number one, can we get a good ROI? Number two, is it an opportunity for a leadership business? Because in most areas, the number one guy makes a lot of money, number two breaks even, everybody else loses money. And then the third area for us is synergy with our core businesses. So good ROI, opportunity for a leadership business, and synergy with the rest of our products. We look across semi today; there aren't many of those types of opportunities. So now around our core competencies in materials engineering, those are areas that we will continue to look at. But today, I would say there aren't that many attractive opportunities that we see that fit those three criteria.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Romit, I think Gary is \u2013 that's the essence of the feedback. I'll give you a little bit more color. One is the TEL deal had the big tax leverage. So that was extra benefit, and that made everything easier, but we still have some tax leverage that if we were ever interested in a foreign company and use our foreign cash, you get about a 50% discount if you think about it. So I'm not saying we're doing it. I'm just saying that's another consideration, all the financial and tax leverage that's sometimes there.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. At Analyst Day at SEMICON, you guys articulated a view of $2.2 billion of OpEx in fiscal year 2016. I think July quarter run rate was about $2.3 billion. The October quarter guidance takes you guys down to that $2.2 billion annualized. So given the weaker fundamental environment, should we expect OpEx to trend even lower beyond the October quarter, and you do guys have a new view on OpEx for fiscal year 2016?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll give you some color without being too specific. The model we put up in July of 2013 was at $2.2 billion \u2013 $2.8 billion actually in fiscal 2016. We trended up over that a little bit in the last year or so, so that our run rate last quarter was $579 million. So it was about $2.3 billion or something like that.","So we were a little bit above that because we had one more year of inflation. And what we've done is we've \u2013 and part of the reason we're a little bit above those companies, one, we were tied up in the merger. There were certain things we couldn't address, and we have a lot of products coming out of the pipeline right now. But we've engaged more, a brighter microscope on OpEx, so next quarter we're at $555 million. And we're working to get down our OpEx back to the original number we guided for 2016, which was the $2.2 billion \u2013 $2.8 billion. We said we'd have a number in 2018 of $2.4 billion, so we're optimistic we'll hit that. And we've got renewed vigor to be opportunistic on OpEx.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And then on the display side, a lot of discussion on the gross margin front. But at the operating margin level, your display margins declined by over 700 basis points. Is the operating margin pressure more the revenue decline? Is it the yen? Is it the mix? And then on your commentary on margins being bad for the next few quarters in display, do you expect operating margins here to trend in this sub-20% range going forward?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think the next couple quarters through Q2 are a little challenging because we've got so much of this new product, new market stuff. But I think longer term, those guys are going to do well. It's unprecedented for us to have over 50% of our revenues in display next year. The good news is, think about it. If you didn't have that, you'd have another $400 million revenue hole or whatever. So it's not where we want to be. It will get better. But for the next couple quarters, it's going to be around there.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think as Bob said, the biggest headwind there for us is mix of mobility versus TV. And if you look at the normal mix that we've seen over the last few years, the operating profit there has been continuing to improve. The revenue is up. And we're in this situation where we believe it will come back to a more normal mix. And actually, we're bullish about the operating profit and revenue increasing as we've seen over the last few years. But this near-term mix is certainly working against us.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Hi, Bob and Gary, just another follow-up question on NAND. I just wanted to know if you could share your early view on 3D NAND wafer builds for next year. I just want to get a sense how comfortable you were that this year is not the peak year for 3D NAND spend for Applied.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll take a shot at it. We believe the installed capacity exit 2014 was about 60,000 \u2013 65,000 wafer starts per month. We think this year exit is about 150,000 wafer starts per month. We think exit 2016 is about 300,000 wafer starts per month, so we think it's doubling every year. This year they had about 85,000 \u2013 90,000 wafer starts per month. The year before they were 40,000 wafer starts per month. So we're going like 40,000 wafer starts per month, 90,000 wafer starts per month, and next year is maybe 150,000 wafer starts per month. It's going up.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","A lot of that booking stuff we got is next year NAND, 3D NAND.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Great, that helps. Thanks, Bob. My follow-up question was on foundry being the swing factor next year. I was just wondering what you think happens when foundry 10-nanometer pilot orders are eventually placed. Do you think it's a steady ramp with this foundry 10-nanometer, or could it be a hockey stick type of spend given some of the complexity of 10-nanometer? Thanks.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll give you my best wrong answer. Typically what happens is that customers will buy X amount of capacity pretty early on so they have it, and then they'll see how well it yields and demand for it. So it's not unusual that they might do \u2013 committed to 30,000 wafer starts say roughly. And then we get the vigorish or the extras if it's yielding well, and then a lot of tape-outs and extra sales. So I think you've got a baseline in the next year that you can count on. And getting to the higher numbers, which we all believe in, is how does 10-nanometer yield, how many customers buy it, what's the tape-outs, all that stuff. So you've got a baseline that you're probably okay on, and then the rest we don't know yet.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks for sharing the color, Bob.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Sundeep Bajikar from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sundeep Madan Bajikar - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question, a question on foundry again. Can we attribute the majority of the foundry weakness you described primarily to one of your large customer's public commentary about CapEx reduction and tool reuse from 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer, or are you describing much more broad-based weakness across multiple customers here?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think the general notion is that customers have improved yields, that customers are getting more effective tool utilization this year versus the last year or two where they bought a little heavier, because some of them shared the same concerns about ramping FinFETs and ramping for big customers. Those are common, more efficient utilization yield from a number of customers. The cancellations we had in Q3 out of our backlog was one specific customer. The softness we see in our Q4 forecast versus what we expect is a couple customers.","Sundeep Madan Bajikar - Jefferies LLC","Thanks so much, that's helpful. And just as a follow-up on the 10-nanometer opportunity, how much of the size of the opportunity growth you're looking at would be driven by capacity expansion compared to a higher process complexity next year?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","On 3D NAND?","Sundeep Madan Bajikar - Jefferies LLC","No, 10-nanometer foundry.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","10-nanometer foundry, we think that from 2016 \u2013 2014 when you go to TAM, it's about 20% to 30%. It's higher process complexity, more layers, stuff like that, so the back end they're going to redo at 10-nanometer, and there are other things they're going to do. So it's 20% to 30% for the same number of wafer starts capital intensity, so that's complexity. Then you've got to get the volume stuff, which I talked about earlier. And we think the reuse thing has been largely wrung out of the system we hope this year. And then finally, the last thing you've got to put in your polynomial equation is what's the end user consumption of those devices.","Sundeep Madan Bajikar - Jefferies LLC","Great, very helpful. Thank you.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi thanks for taking my questions. I guess similar to a question asked earlier but looking a little longer term, if you look at the demand side, PC is declining year over year. Smartphones are peaking out, and now Moore's Law seems to be pushing out, which I'm curious about your view there. How should we think about the WFE spending growth going forward over the next few years rather than just next year? And is it just the spending being spread over a longer period of time?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll take a shot at it again. Let's segment the market. WFE \u2013 3D NAND we're pretty bullish on actually because this is a technology transition which is more akin to a wafer size transition because when they have to switch from 2D to 3D for both device performance. And you can't keep shrinking; electrons in a cell, you can't get any smaller, and so you can't effectively. So they're going to go to 3D. It's like 300-millimeter, you knew customers were going to go; it's just timing. So they waited a year or two, but it's happening. You can see the numbers going up rapidly, and everybody says it. So I think if anything, you've got a solid baseline of predictable spending that's pretty healthy in 3D NAND for a number of years.","On DRAM, we're a little bit more optimistic than some of our other folks because the things that are helping you there is the number of layers, capital intensity is picking up for greenfield, number one. Number two, the die sizes on average are getting bigger, particularly on mobile dies. And DRAM bit growth is pretty good, so I think DRAM is okay. And the other thing helping DRAM and memory in general is the whole data center, big data, cloud stuff is definitely a positive, definitely.","Now let's go to logic. Logic hasn't been high growth for a while. It's mostly driven by PCs. And for Applied, it isn't that big either. So that one, we don't think about it every single day because it hasn't been that volatile in the last few years.","So then we go to foundry. Foundry, the big driver of foundry tends to be mobile devices, and mobile devices have had very good growth. Many people continue to believe they'll be pretty good. If they're pretty good, you're in good shape because capital intensity continues to go up. As we said, it's 20% to 30% going from 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, to 10 nanometer. So if you get pretty good consumption of mobile devices and related things like that, and even some of this Internet of Things stuff is picking up frankly, then you've got healthy foundry demand. So the one that this particular quarter we were a little surprised on for next quarter was the foundry, but it doesn't mean we don't feel good about foundry fundamentals given the capital intensity and end user demand we think is good. So I think it's okay.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. My follow-up question is a little more near term. You talk about gaining four points of share in DRAM, which is great. And you also mentioned you expect DRAM orders will come to be lower in the second half versus first half, which we are seeing. What are your thoughts right now as it relates to when DRAM orders will start to grow again, especially in light of an oversupply situation this year? And related to that, do you see any downside risk for DRAM CapEx this year?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","DRAM was more heavily weighted to the first half. I've got a fancy PowerPoint around here that shows me that. And so if you look at DRAM this year, it was like 55:45 in the calendar year for us, so it was more heavily weighted to the first half. We think DRAM next year we're not as pessimistic as others. We think it's probably down but not down a lot. Maybe it's down 10%. Who the hell knows, but that's where I'm leaning. In terms of timing next year, I have a little less visibility on that.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","You your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Pacific Crest. Your line is open.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just first, global services op margin trended down a bit despite record revenue. I'm just wondering if you could help us understand that discrepancy.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think it was the mix of what they sold. In other words, if you go look at those guys, they have 200-millimeter tools, spares, services. And as I remember it, the mix was a little bit different between those. Let me see if I can look at this. Yes, I think it was a mix change within their revenues more than anything else.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think long term...","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. And then...","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just one other thing on that one. Longer term, we've seen tremendous growth in terms of revenue in the service business. We think that's sustainable, that the growth is sustainable. And we think margin growth will also improve there as we're bringing more valuable services and then focused on the key inflections for our customers.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the margin side, this would be gross margin. You mentioned that you need to get cost out of products, particularly in etch, when you were answering a question earlier. Can you just give us an idea of what some of the levers you actually have for that would be?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's mostly material costs. There are also some opportunities in installation, warranty, and burden, overhead cost. So if you go look it with a new tool, I'll do the last one first. Inflation warranty cost tends to run higher, so we can reduce that, number one.","The second thing is the chamber, which we've ramped really aggressively. Even at Analyst Day, we said we were going from a year ago five chambers a quarter or something to hundreds of chambers. And we said by the end of this calendar year at Analyst Day we'd be to 300 chambers. I don't know if you picked up on the script. I think Gary said by the end of fiscal Q1, which is one month later, January, it was 450 chambers or something like that. So that chamber is ramping super aggressively. So that's an opportunity to reduce costs. And many times you have six chambers on a tool, so there are six of those. So we'll work on that.","And the other thing, even the wafer handling equipment is probably an opportunity with the platform there. So it's installation, warranty, it's burden and absorption with volume, which some of it will come relatively naturally, and then it's material cost reduction around both the chamber and the handling systems. And then also the other thing is configuration management. Can we have a little less heavily configured tools?","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. And just along those lines, have you run into any unexpected issues with installations or reliability as you've been installing these chambers that might be weighing down the gross margin?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Not too bad, it's getting better.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think if anything, the ramp is way more aggressive than we've seen in Applied for any product in the past, and so that's the good news. It makes it harder for us to drive these improvements and then have them in the bottom line as quickly. But the good news is the product is ramping, if anything, much, much faster than we had anticipated.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The other thing that's tactical in nature is to get some of the material cost through the P&L, you've got to ship the tool and revenue it. So any inventory you have, in order to cost reduce it, you have to ship that inventory first.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","All right, thank you very much.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Wes. And, Kyle, we've got time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yes, good afternoon. So I haven't heard you mention advanced packaging recently. Is that still a focus to the company? And if so what's your outlook there?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We definitely have a focus on packaging. We have a pretty good position with our plating business. MDP is also a strong one for us. We don't see that being \u2013 as you look at real needle-movers on EPS, it's not a really big opportunity for us in the next year. Longer term we look at it as a growth opportunity. But relative to the other things that we're talking about, it's not in the same category.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. And then back on the bookings, you said that the foundries got weaker through the quarter. Is there a risk to any of the bookings you had for foundries earlier in the quarter of debooking over the next quarter or two?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","There's some risk, but a lot of that stuff in those type of customers is book-and-ship. The stuff in other customers are more backlog-weighted.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much. Maybe as a follow-up to some of the foundry questions you've answered today, I understand with the push-outs of some of the 16-nanometer\/14-nanometer capacity related to end-user demand and the higher tools utilization, is there any change in their (1:07:33) given the better tool utilization (1:07:38)?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Patrick, you were fading out on us. I think you said is there any change in their what?","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Their 10-nanometer plans, given the better tool utilization and yields at 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I don't think so. 10-nanometer, they're still pushing aggressively. 10-nanometer, they'll probably change the back end. That will contribute to higher capital intensity. The tool utilization now, some of that high tool utilization was getting better yields on their first FinFET because that was a tricky one. The second one is not quite as worrisome. And then the third thing is some of that higher tool reuse is a natural progression from 20-nanometer, to 16-nanometer, or 20-nanometer to 14-nanometer.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And, Bob, maybe as a specific question on the operating model for you, I think I've known you long enough or well enough that the gross margin is a big focus for you guys, and you're not just going to sit idly by to let the product mix shift. Are there specific things you can do, particularly on the flat panel display side, given you mentioned the smaller mobile display product mix issues? Are there things you can do specifically to improve that over time?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, there are. That's what we're doing. We're taking down costs and material costs and overhead and installation\/warranty. I have to admit that the shift in mix in the current quarter surprised me a little bit. So we're not being passive, we're pushing it hard. It just came one quarter earlier than we expected, to be honest with you.","And the other thing I'll say to you, the good news, the gross margins, we definitely are committed to getting them up. We definitely believe we should have higher gross margins, no doubt about it, Gary and I rail about this every day basically. But the glass is half full on this thing. If you look at it, we've gained over four points of share in DRAM, over four points of share in NAND. We've gained \u2013 we expanded our TAM or SAM in display probably 50%, and we've expanded our service SAM and revenues in service quite a bit. If we hadn't done those things, you wouldn't be talking about gross margins being down two points. You'd be talking about over $1 billion less of revenues probably this year. And even the revenues, if you don't like the gross margins, those are probably incremental operating margins of 30% or so. You'd be talking about a $300 million hole in profit.","So we're spectacularly unhappy with our gross margins. I don't disagree. But it could have been a lot worse if we hadn't penetrated these markets, gained share, and got some new products out there. You would have had a sustainable problem of $300 million of profit a year, frankly. And if you look at the etch business, for instance, where we don't like the gross margins, believe it or not, the one business where operating margin delta from 2012 to today is greatest is probably etch because we've scaled up so much volume at pretty good operating margins. So we're spectacularly unhappy with the gross margins, but if we hadn't gotten this stuff out and repositioned the stuff, it would be an even worse call today.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you very much.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's my answer.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right, Patrick, thank you for your question.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Good afternoon. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied\u2019s current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filings with the SEC.","All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of February 14, 2019, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike.","In our first fiscal quarter of 2019, Applied Materials delivered solid results in a challenging business environment. Over the past two months, we have become increasingly cautious about near-term macroeconomic risks and have seen further pullback in customers\u2019 investments. At the same time, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term. Powerful new growth drivers for the semiconductor and display industries are emerging, and we see tremendous opportunities for the Company ahead.","While we\u2019re taking appropriate actions to navigate current market dynamics, we are not losing focus on the bigger picture. We\u2019re making strategic investments in new technology, products and capabilities that will position Applied to play a bigger and broader role in the future.","In today's call, I'll start by providing more details about our outlook for the year ahead; then, I'll talk about the future growth drivers that are reshaping our industry; and I will finish by describing Applied\u2019s strategy and highlight some recent accomplishments and milestones.","Let me begin with the near-term environment and our current perspective on 2019. In the past quarter, there's been more negative than positive news with the whole industry facing challenges, which include macro conditions in emerging markets that have weakened; smartphone demand falling short of expectations, particularly for high-end models which have more semiconductor content; and DRAM prices, which have declined as inventory levels build.","On the positive side, we've also observed that NAND inventories are coming down from very high levels seen in the fall, although they remain above normal levels. Fundamental dynamics in the memory market are healthy with very-disciplined investment in new capacity and a strong commitment to advance the technology roadmap. And, looking more broadly at semiconductor capital investment, it\u2019s important to note that we are in a period of market transition and diversification.","For the past several years, smartphones drove the majority of wafer fab equipment spending. This year, more than half of customers\u2019 investments will be driven by other categories as new growth drivers, including cloud data centers, IoT devices, 5G and automotive applications gain momentum.","When we take all these factors into account, we see the following implications for Applied\u2019s served markets. Based on recent public comments by our customers, NAND bit demand is expected to grow in the mid-30% range this year and DRAM bit demand in the mid to high teens. As result, we believe that investment by memory customers will be down substantially in 2019. However, we also expect channel inventory levels to normalize as the year progresses, creating a more favorable setup for 2020. In foundry logic, we see investment being flat to slightly up year-on-year, but we expect a higher portion of the spending to be directed towards long lead time equipment, specifically EUV lithography. While this represents a market share headwind for Applied in both 2018 and 2019, it\u2019s also a positive indicator of customers\u2019 future investment in leading-edge process tools.","Overall, we believe that wafer fab equipment spending in 2019 will be down mid to high teens on a percentage basis versus last year.","In display, weakness in emerging markets is also impacting the timing of customers\u2019 investment plans. We see some TV factory projects pushing out of year and into 2020. As a result, we now believe our display equipment revenue in 2019 will decline by about a third from 2018's record levels. We also expect revenue in the second fiscal quarter to be significantly lower than our average run rate for the year.","Over the longer term, we believe the display market remains attractive as the industry is going through several large technology transitions as larger substrates are introduced in TV manufacturing, rigid OLED adoption increases in smartphones and expands to other applications and initial flexible OLED products get closer to release. These inflections create important growth opportunities for Applied over the next several years.","While we\u2019re paying close attention to current headwinds and driving efficiencies across the Company, we remain focused on our long-term opportunities. I strongly believe that in the future, technology will play a larger part in many areas of our lives. Entire industries will be transformed by artificial intelligence, big data and Industry 4.0. And at the foundation of those transformations are semiconductors.","We're moving beyond a world of general purpose computing to specialized solutions that address new types of applications and workloads in the cloud and at the edge. And while the need for semiconductor innovation has never been greater, classic Moore's law scaling is challenged. Simply shrinking transistors no longer delivers simultaneous improvements in the power, performance and cost of chips.","As I\u2019ve said before, to unlock the full potential of AI and big data, we need a new playbook for semi conductor design and manufacturing, which will include new architectures, new 3D techniques, novel materials, new ways to shrink transistors and advanced packaging techniques, all five of these areas required major advances in materials engineering and create tremendous opportunities for Applied Materials.","To enable this playbook and accelerate innovation for our customers, we are making investments in new capabilities, creating entirely new types of products and extending our engagements across the ecosystem. For example, we recently announced that we are expanding our longstanding technology partnership with IBM as a member of their new AI hardware center. We\u2019re also making good progress with our new materials engineering technology accelerator, which is on track to open later this year. The META Center will support deeper collaborations with system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community.","In addition to broadening our participation in the AI big data inflection, we\u2019re also building a more resilient company with diversified revenue streams. The portion of our revenue generated from sources other than new 300 millimeters semiconductor equipment sales is increasing. Combined, we expect our services, spares, upgrades, consulting, software and display and flexible technology businesses to represent about 45% of total sales this year.","In Applied Global Services, our progress is fueled by a growing installed base and new advanced service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize operating costs. We grew AGS revenue more than 20% in fiscal 2018, and we anticipate high single digit growth this year, even with wafer fab equipment spending expected to be down significantly. One reason for this is that more than half our service and spares business now comes from subscription type revenues in the form of long-term service agreements.","Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Given the elevated macro risks and a challenging environment in both the memory and display markets, our near-term outlook is one of caution. Despite these headwinds in 2019, we remain highly optimistic about the future. While we are taking steps to ensure our spending is aligned with short-term market conditions, we\u2019re focusing our investments on long-term opportunities. We\u2019re driving innovative new product development and building new capabilities that position Applied to play a bigger and broader role in the industry over the coming years.","Now, Dan will provide his perspective on our performance and outlook.","Dan Durn","Thanks, Gary.","Today, I will outline our financial strategy in the current environment, then summarize our Q1 financial results, provide our Q2 business outlook and give you an update on our new META Center in New York.","As Gary outlined, the end markets that our customers serve, weakened during the quarter. As a result, our semi equipment customers are taking proactive steps to carefully manage capacity additions and reduce inventories. This sets the industry up well for 2020 and beyond. We continue to expect the recovery to be shallow and gradual, and we\u2019re still not ready to call the bottom of the current cycle. At the same time, it's important to put this year\u2019s spending into context.","Our WFE forecast for 2019 is still billions of dollars higher than the peaks of all the prior cycles. Today, our backlog remains healthy, our profitability is solid, we\u2019re generating strong free cash flow, and we\u2019re returning cash to shareholders. Most importantly, we see significant opportunities ahead. And we have the resources to make disciplined investments to secure technology leadership and growth. Our strategy is to navigate the current environment by carefully managing our overall expenses, fully funding our new product pipeline and maximizing our recurring revenue. Here are some specific examples.","First, expense control. Our Q1 non GAAP OpEx was $750 million, including savings from our holiday shutdown and only one month of our annual merit increase. In Q2, absent these same benefits, we\u2019re guiding our overall OpEx to be approximately flat sequentially.","Next, R&D funding. Even in the current environment, we\u2019re investing more in R&D to strengthen and grow our new technology and product pipeline. Gary described how the industry needs new architectures and materials to enable better chips for AI. Later this year, we plan to introduce materials engineering solutions designed to accelerate the adoption of the next generation of memory chips, which will be highly enabling the cloud computing and the Internet of things.","Third, recurring revenue. Gary described our services revenue should be higher in 2019, even as WFE declines. We expect the transactional portion of our AGS revenue to grow more slowly this year as our customers work down excess inventories, but the subscription part of AGS should be higher year-over-year. In fact, in 2018, we grew the number of tools under comprehensive service agreements at 3 times the rate of new system shipments. So, we\u2019re doing a good job of delivering ongoing value of our customers across a larger portion of our installed base, which is the largest in the industry.","Next, I'll summarize our quarterly results. As a reminder, Applied adopted the ASC 606 standard for revenue recognition this quarter, using the full retrospective approach. Bear in mind, the differences between revenue recognized under ASC 606 and the old standard will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but over time, they will offset each other and the cumulative difference will be minimal. As we expected, the adoption of ASC 606 had a minimal cumulative impact on the Company, increasing our retained earnings by about $6 million.","Now, to the results. In Q1, we delivered revenue that was slightly above the midpoint of guidance. Our non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses were at the midpoint of guidance. We generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.81, which was $0.02 above the midpoint, including the impact of a slightly higher tax rate.","Turning to the segments. Semiconductor Systems revenue was $2.27 billion and about 1 percentage point above the midpoint of our outlook. SSG\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin was 28.3%. Global Services revenue was $962 million and 2 points above the midpoint of our guidance. AGS non-GAAP operating margin was 29.6%. Display revenue was $507 million and 1 point above the midpoint of our guidance. The Group\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin was 23.3%.","Turning to the balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $834 million or 22% of sales. We returned $942 million to shareholders including $750 million in buybacks. We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion in cash and investments, and $3.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Next, I\u2019ll provide our Q2 guidance. We expect Company revenue to be approximately $3.48 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Within the outlook, we expect silicon systems revenue to be in the range of $2.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Services revenue should be $970 million, plus or minus $25 million. Our Display revenue should be in the range of $340 million, plus or minus $25 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margins of around 43.5% and non-GAAP OpEx of around $750 million, plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP earnings should be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70 per share. And our current non-GAAP tax rate expectation is approximately 14%. This is about 2 percentage points higher than our initial expectation for 2019. We've raised our rate expectation primarily to reflect the potential impact of new regulations proposed by the Treasury Department along with our latest forecast for geographic revenue mix.","Now, I will close with an update on the R&D capabilities we\u2019re creating at our META Center in upstate New York. Over the past quarter, we received approvals needed to begin receiving $250 million in public funding, which is being used to purchase and install Applied Materials systems and other equipment. We've now shipped our first systems to the META Center, which will be one of the most advanced R&D centers in the world. We\u2019re already engaged with multiple customers to accelerate breakthroughs in semiconductor technology along with new applications of our materials engineering capabilities, and we\u2019re on track to be running wafers in the second half of the year.","Now, Mike, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Dan.","Now, to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please pull the operator, and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open.","C.J. Muse","I guess, two-part question. In terms of your overall guide by segment, it looks like you\u2019re suggesting roughly $3.55 billion a quarter in revenues. And I guess, is that math kind of in the ballpark of what you\u2019re thinking? And then, more importantly, how are you thinking about gross margin trajectory as we go through the year on the changing mix?","Dan Durn","Thanks, C.J. Can I get you to repeat your first question? I didn\u2019t quite understand where you're going. The second part of the question is, as we look sequentially into Q2, you see the gross margin guide. Off of those levels into the back half of our fiscal year, we would expect to see incremental improvement into Q3 and then step up again into Q4. But, I apologize. I didn\u2019t catch the first part of your question.","C.J. Muse","It was just adding up the different segment guide, and is it fair to say that roughly $3.55 billion is kind of what you\u2019re seeing on average on a quarterly basis for revenues through the calendar year?","Dan Durn","Yes. So, I don't think on this call, we\u2019ll be guiding for the full year. But, what we do see in the Q2 is $3.48 billion for the overall Company revenue, plus or minus $150 million.","Operator","Our next question is from Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is now open.","Atif Malik","A two-part question for me as well. First, Gary, could you just talk about what should we expect display mix between LCD and OLED this year? And then, is there any change to your view on the capital intensity of OLED TVs into next year as some of the LCD makers are converting the LCD line to quantum dot and other flavors of OLED? And then, I have a follow-up for Dan.","Gary Dickerson","Okay. Thanks for the question. Let me give you some overall color on the display business. And hopefully, I'll cover the two questions that you have. In the six years through 2018, we were able to grow the display business at a compound annual growth rate of around 25% to $2.5 billion last year. In 2019, we signaled incremental weakness on the last call. And the market has continued to weaken since that call. We now believe that the market is down around a third from 2018\u2019s record levels with second quarter -- our second quarter to be significantly lower than our projected average run rate for 2019 and 2020. Relative to the mix on -- what we have is the biggest incremental change since the last call as weakness in TV, delays in TV investments. It\u2019s still compelling for customers to go to Gen 10.5 panels because you can produce eight 65-inch TVs versus three on Gen 8.5. So, it\u2019s strategically important for them to go and make that transition. But, the timing of the investments are being pushed out. And then, going into 2020, we see small improvement in 2020. And we defiantly like the longer-term technology trends and opportunities to grow the business. So, hopefully that gives you some indication around mix. The biggest difference from our last call is in TV market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Toshiya Hari","Gary, you talked about the EUV headwind and the impact it had on your market share in 2018, and your expectations for 2019. Should we be concerned that it could remain a headwind into 2020 and beyond or is there sort of initial ramp-up of EUV that\u2019s causing some of these issues for you? Thank you.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. I think if you look at overall market share, third-party data is going to come out in a little over a month. We will all see the numbers, including our share. One thing that we\u2019ll see is that in the six years going into 2017, we were the only major supplier to be up or flat for six consecutive years. And certainly, what we said in \u201818 is that our share will be down, demand softened in the back half of the year; we saw push out to NAND, reuse in foundry. And overall spending mix shifted towards litho and areas we don't compete. What you will see in about a month is gains in areas like implant, epi, etch, gaining momentum in packaging. And also in our process control business, I\u2019m happy about the progress there. We had a record year. Very strong growth in our e-beam technologies. We may end up being number one in e-beam for the first time ever, and very well positioned with the additional adoptions of new products in \u201819.","In \u201818 and \u201819, logic customers are buying EUV systems. And those systems have very long lead times. They are buying the EUV tools years before they go into high-volume manufacturing. We look at that as a positive indicator in the adoption of future nodes. But certainly, right now, in \u201818 and \u201819, it's definitely a headwind.","And as we go forward as NAND spending resumes, that's more material spending versus litho spending. That's certainly good for us. The trailing nodes are also not litho dependent. So, that's also going to be good going forward. And then, another factor in \u201819 that\u2019s more favorable setup for us, we have balanced share in foundry logic and memory. So, in a year where DRAM and NAND are much weaker, the relative set-up for us is better in 2019.","And then, what we\u2019ve talked about is over the longer term, we see a very different picture emerging. It\u2019s clear, the industry needs a new playbook that goes beyond 2D scaling. And I deeply believe Applied is in the best position to enable the playbook. I meet all the time with customers, the leaders of R&D for our top customers on a monthly basis. And this is a big focus for all of those customers. We\u2019ve talked about five drivers of power, performance and area and cost as to 2D scaling slows, and all of those are dependent on breakthroughs in materials engineering. So, I would say longer term, that creates a great opportunity for us.","Dan talked about in his prepared remarks new memory technology for AI that's coming later this year; I\u2019ve talked about a 1,000x improvement in leakage current that improves power efficiency. Those are just early examples of the new playbook, extensive playbook that we've developed. And then, we've also talked about speeding up the new playbook by opening the META Center and figuring out how to integrate all this together, so customers can move it into their fabs.","I definitely believe the right vision for the industry is material to systems 10 times faster, driving this new playbook. There's never been a time where it's more important. So, that\u2019s the playbook on how we\u2019re going to move the needle for the industry and for Applied.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Garry, as always, I appreciate all the detail you gave in your prepared comments. One of the things you mentioned is just the expectation that memory will be down significantly this year in calendar year \u201819, which really shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anybody. I was wondering if you could just help us understand how your views differ between NAND and DRAM CapEx for this year, and whether or not you see either recovering in the back half of the calendar year? And I guess importantly, could you talk a little bit about what happens to your SAM in NAND as the industry transitions from 64 to 96 layers?","Gary Dickerson","So, thanks for the question. Let me take first the market opportunity for us. There is no question as customers increase the number of layers, it's all about materials intensity. And so, that creates a tremendous opportunity for us. We grew market share in memory a significant amount over the last five years. A lot of the improvements around new materials, new technologies that drive that scaling are really great opportunities for Applied. We are increasing our etch share also in memory. So, that's also a very good setup for us. So, certainly, as the scaling goes forward, we expect that we\u2019re going to continue to grow our share, as we've done over the last several years. And maybe Dan, you can answer the question about DRAM versus NAND.","Dan Durn","Sure. Thanks, Gary. And John, to get to how 2019 is profiling in the memory space, let me start with what we saw in 2018 and use that as a jumping off point to make some comparative statements about how we see the market profiling in 2019. We\u2019ll probably not going to be point specific on how 2018 ended up because Gartner\u2019s going to come out in a month or two with those estimates. But, we definitely saw 2018 up over \u201817, definitely has a 5 handle on it. And as you indicated, it was a strong memory growth year. We think as 2018 settled, 60% of the spend in the market was memory related, 40% -- about 40% was foundry logic related. Within memory, we saw the NAND DRAM spend very balanced.","As we look forward into 2019 and Gary\u2019s prepared comments, he said, year-over-year, WFE in \u201819 will be down. Memory will be down by a good amount. We expect foundry logic to be flat to up a little bit. So, as 2019 shakes out, we expect foundry logic to be greater than memory. Overall, the market will be down mid to high teens. And as we look at the market between NAND and DRAM, we see it profiling very similar to \u201818 and being balanced.","In terms of the second half and come back in the market. I think, we want to set expectations for a slow, gradual recovery off of these levels. While we're having conversations with customers and we see positive lead indicators, we think it's prudent in this environment to set those expectations for a slow, gradual recovery. As we look into the back half of the year, inventory levels come down faster than we expect, utilizations come up and price stability, those would all create the environmentals for a more robust second half. And if that scenario materializes, then we would benefit significantly from that environment.","And then, I wanted to come back to C.J.'s original question, because now I think I understand a bit of what he was asking for. And I apologize, C.J.","Let me help shape the revenues this year to I think get at the question you were asking. Off of the levels we guided in Q2, we see our Semi Systems Group flattish on a quarterly basis into the back part of the year. The run rate of our Display business in Q2 will be below the annual average. So, we would see -- expect to see that growing into the back part of the year. And then, AGS will have its normal seasonal profile and be higher into Q3 and Q4. So, hopefully, that helps giving you a bit of a profile and color. And then, the gross margin part of your question again, we expected that to incrementally step up in Q3 and again into Q4.","Operator","Our next question is from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","Can you just help us understand how you\u2019re thinking about the OpEx trajectory beyond Q2, if you do start to see gradual recovery as you describe it? And then, on the other hand, if revenues were to take another step down, let\u2019s say beyond Q2, how much could the team flex their OpEx?","Dan Durn","So, OpEx is definitely a controllable spend line. The philosophy we have at the Company is, is we\u2019re going to be an inflection-focused growth company. We\u2019re going to grow organically and invest in products and capabilities that will help drive that growth going forward. We do it in the context of the environment we operate in. We will be disciplined operators and instill spend discipline throughout the Company.","As you take a look at the guide into Q2, what I would expect, if you take a step back and think about where we were a quarter or two ago, we had said we spend about $3 billion in OpEx in 2018, we would expect that to grow by about $200 million into \u201819. We've adjusted those plans in light of the current environment we\u2019re in and will probably bring that down by about $175 million over the course of 2019 off of the original expectations. So, up 1 percent, maybe 1.5% off of the levels we were in 2018. And we think this strikes the right balance, giving everything we know between near-term discipline that reflects the environment we operate in and strong pursuit of new technologies, new platforms, new winning products that will preserve shareholder value creation into the inflections that we see materializing in the years ahead.","Operator","Our next question is from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Your line is now open.","Pierre Ferragu","I just wanted come back to the point you make Gary about EUV being like a share gainer against you this year but the leading indicator for you going forward. So, how much visibility did you have at this point in time on when you EUV gets introduced in mass manufacturing, how the share I would say of AMAT of spending wafer is evolving? So, that\u2019s one question. And then, the second question is, how much of the benefit you see on the back of EUV is just more of what you do already, and how much is actually new technology you\u2019re going to introduce as well, things like cobalt interconnect and others?","Gary Dickerson","So, EUV, as I\u2019ve talked about, you\u2019re seeing early adoption in 2018 and 2019. And in 2019, you\u2019re going to see the first ships being built. So, you have pilot production in -- when you\u2019re adopting the new technology like this, it happens years before you go into high-volume manufacturing. So, you see this initial adoption surge in advance of a high-volume manufacturing. And so, again, we do see that as a good leading indicator relative to N5 for instance, when that happens.","Now, one thing also to remember is that EUV will remove legacy etch and dep steps. I mean, that\u2019s why customers are adopting EUV because it replaces a number of different etch steps, but those aren\u2019t our steps. So, at every node, the most important thing for the customers is they have to drive power, performance and area and cost. And definitely with power and performance 2D scaling helps, but even more important is innovation in material. So, if you look at a node like N5 for instance, there are many materials inflections that are being adopted as customers drive improvements in power and performance. We have a number of different new steps there advanced metal gate material, epi steps, we have hot and cold implant going from 500 degree C to minus 140, new surface treatments. We\u2019re increasing our share in etch steps and have good momentum in new process control solutions. So, that is what will come four us. But what you see right now is this early adoption of EUV as customers prepare for those higher volume ramps.","What I will also say, and I\u2019ve talked about this many times is I do believe that the industry needs a new playbook. We have stronger and deeper engagements than we've ever had with customers. So, that really positions us well. Relative to N5, we\u2019re well-positioned. We have deep engagements with customers are to drive power and performance on N5 and also for future nodes.","And just the last thing I would add, when we talk about EUV adoption, the majority of the EUV is really in leading-edge technology and logic foundry. You have half the market that\u2019s memory that\u2019s driven by materials; you\u2019ve got about 25% of the market that\u2019s specialty nodes, power devices, image sensors, which also are great opportunity for us. So, we see about 75% of market really great opportunities. And the leading edge foundry and logic is really about power and performance in addition to 2D scaling. And we\u2019re in the best position to drive that with our customers going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Steve [ph] calling on behalf of Krish. First one, if I could, Gary, on your Semi Systems business as it relates to China, fully appreciate the ongoing U.S. China trade tension, and also given that there is that -- the one export control on one of your DRAM customers in China. I was wondering if you have seen any spillover effects from trade tensions and control as some of your other customers, whether it\u2019s in terms of pushout in any ramp schedules or perhaps even -- any increased focus or sourcing tools from local Chinese vendors -- by your Chinese customers as well?","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Thanks for the question. So, relative to China, from what we see today, it feels like mostly business as usual with our customers in the region. We\u2019re very well-positioned in China with domestic and multinational customers. We've been in China for 35 years, very deep relationships across semi and display.","Just a little bit of color on China. We expect China wafer fab equipment investment to be down year-over-year in \u201819 versus \u201818. And we see both domestic and multinational down in China. In China domestic, we see higher spending on foundry logic versus memory with foundry logic focused on trailing nodes, for sensors, IoT, those types of devices. Within China domestic spending, we\u2019re in a great position and we expect that we\u2019re going to gain share. And then, also our Display business in China will be down, in line with our overall global Display forecast. So, overall, we have a super strong position in China, Semi Service, Display, great teams, strong relationship and feel good about how we\u2019re positioned going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","If I could ask quick follow-up on 200 millimeter equipment demand. I think number of foundries globally have talked about 8-inch wafer fab initiatives focused specifically on IoT, automotive opportunities in the future. Is that something that will help equipment demand later this year? And should we expect to see those benefits on the systems side or on the AGS side? Thanks.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks for the question, Steve. The trailing node geometries in general have been profiling very strong for the last couple of years, and 200 millimeter equipment demand is also the same. We continue to expect a healthy outlook for those mature nodes going forward. And the 200 millimeter equipment demand remains strong. Like you said, IoT sensors are proliferating and driving significant demand at those mature nodes. I would also say that there are new AI chip architectures that are being designed at the 28 nanometer node, and they are going to deliver high performance. But to get the same transistor count out into the market as the 7 nanometer node, you need 8 times of the wafer at 28 nanometer. So, the fact that we\u2019re getting new designs of highly capable silicon at nodes like 28 nanometers, I think bodes well for the trialing node market. 200 millimeter is experiencing the same type of dynamic and continues to be strong. From a financial reporting standpoint, we report our 200 millimeter equipment segment as part of our services, AGS reporting segment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open.","Timothy Arcuri","I had two questions. Dan, I guess, the first one is, I\u2019m looking at the gross margins guidance, 43.5; it\u2019s about the same as you were doing on like $1 billion lower revenue, sort of in mid-2016. So, my first question is, I\u2019m just kind of wondering why gross margin gains are not really dropping through over that period. Is that because a lot of the incremental revenue is coming on the services side? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Dan Durn","Thanks, Tim. As we talked about historically, gross margin is going to be a function of a number of factors. There is an aggregate revenue component; there is mix between our segments and then product mix within segments as well as overall activity levels in the factory, and they will vary from quarter to quarter. As we take a look at our guide into Q2, when we compare it to peak quarter, about a year ago, we\u2019re profiling favorably relative to our peers in the industry. And so, the Company we think is doing a good job in a difficult environment, given the parameters we talked about that influence gross margin and we\u2019re profiling I think favorably relative to peers in the industry, given that peak comparison. And you had a follow-up question, Tim.","Timothy Arcuri","I did. And yes, I\u2019m just trying to understand the change in the model. I think, you said maybe six or some months ago before WFE fell off, I think the feeling was that you would do roughly 3.25 annualized at 40 billion WFE. We\u2019re sort of even a little bit above that right, we\u2019re probably a 41 or 42. But even if you say we\u2019re at 40, you\u2019re sort of -- based on the guidance, you\u2019re at roughly 2.65 a year annualized. So, that's roughly 20% below where you thought, so pretty big number. I\u2019m just wondering, sort of what\u2019s changed. Thanks.","Dan Durn","So, here is what I would share with you and what we see. In the November quarter, we noted that 2019 was going to shape up a lot like 2017, and that would give us an earnings per share a bit above $3.25. And since then, we\u2019ve seen pre-announcements by end customers, one company in the smartphones space, another one in the GPU, and cryptocurrency continues to be weak. So, we've taken customer spending down in semi and display. And if you layer in what Gary said, down mid to high teens on a year-over-year basis, clearly, WFE spend is now below the levels we saw in 2017. So, my expectation is, is that earnings not surprisingly will be lower than they were in 2017. But, I do like the way the customers are taking proactive steps to get supply in balance with demand, work down inventories in both memory and the logic foundry space. So, I see the setup into 2020 as being quite good.","Operator","Our next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Vivek Arya","A classification and a question. On the clarification, Dan, I was hoping you could give us some more color around the subscription versus transactional mix in AGS. So, let us predict how sensitive that business is to WFE versus your increasing base of deployed tools. And then, the question is, if I look at WFE over longer period of time, it was in the low to mid 30s for many years and then in \u201817 and \u201818 it jumped well above that trend to 50 billion plus. And now, this year, they are in the low 40 billion. What I\u2019m trying to understand is, what is the right base line level that when we have let\u2019s 2020 as normal -- quote unquote normal year, do we grow off of the low 40s that we\u2019re right now or do we grow off 50s? How do you conceptually think about modeling WFE growth over the next three to five years?","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the subscription question and then turn it over to Dan. So, overall, our service business has grown about 15% compound annual growth rate over the last four years. In 2018, we grew over 20%. What I said in the prepared remarks is we see high single-digit growth in 2019 in a soft market. And part of what helps us is exactly what you talked about is this subscription revenue. We have a higher percentage over half of our business in subscription revenue with long-term agreements. And so, when you\u2019re in a soft market, those long-term agreements versus just selling parts makes a very, very big difference. That\u2019s been a conscious strategy on our part to create value for customers, drive more of these comprehensive service agreements. If you look at 2018, the comprehensive service agreements grew three times faster than the rate of new shipments. So, we have -- we really changed that strategy around five years ago, relative to driving more long-term agreement, subscription type revenue, and even in 2018, it's still growing at a very high rate. It really comes back to creating value for customers, optimizing output, yield, cost. We\u2019ve put a tremendous focus there. And again, we\u2019re getting a lot of traction. So, it\u2019s good for us, and also definitely good for our customers. And I'll turn it over to Dan for the next question.","Dan Durn","Yes. And Vivek, on the second part of your question, I think there is a couple of ways to look at it. If we take a longer-term perspective around WFE and we look at it as a percentage of overall semiconductor revenue and you go back to couple of decades, 2000, WFE as a percentage of semiconductor revenues was about 17%. This was a bit of a peak because our customers were investing in both 200 and 300 millimeter systems. And then, over the course of the next decade as 300 millimeter cut in all the factory automation systems and the way our customers consolidated and became more efficient in operating their footprint of capacity, you saw it come down to about 9% in 2013. Now that all the efficiency gains from 300 millimeter have worked their way through the system, 450 millimeters is not on the roadmap, in the last few years since 2013, that WFE intensity has gone to 11% to 12%. In an environment characterized like we\u2019re in now where we see elevated inventory levels on both the foundry logic side as well as the memory side, and our customers managing in a very disciplined way supply to meet end market demand, we see those inventories come down. And so, I think it's a good set up for 2020. But, I don't think what happens to this year forms the baseline because we do think what's happening this year is shipping below true end market demand as these inventories come down.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from \u200eMorgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Joe Moore","I wanted to follow up on the comment that you made about China spending being down and being little bit foundry oriented. There still seems to be quite a bit of desire to build a sovereign memory business and we\u2019ve seen a number of players talk about spending large amounts of money. What do you think it has to -- it's going to take to sort of kick start that effort, and is it a function of the technology being production ready, is it a function of the market environment, creating new spaces, what's the gating factor behind that business starting to grow?","Gary Dickerson","Memory technology, I think, you can see in terms of the 3D NAND ramp is very difficult. Companies that have decades of experience, tremendous technology, deep experience, talent, I mean, those customers had difficulty transitioning from 2D to 3D NAND. And certainly DRAM scaling is extremely difficult right now. So, it just takes a lot of time to build that type of technology base. And you\u2019ll also need experienced talent across many, many different types of the skill set. So, what we said before in terms of China is that China will definitely continue to incrementally spend but it\u2019s going to be years before you see -- if you look at cost for bit, any type of competitiveness on the leading edge is going to take a lot of time to develop the technology, to develop the talent. And in the meantime, again in the foundry logic area, there is a tremendous growth in sensors, IoT, trailing edge technologies. And we see rational spending there ramping in China. And again that's the more of the spending in 2019. So, again, we see increases but as we said before, we don't see a hockey stick. It\u2019s going to take many years to build the talent and technology.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Joe. And operator, I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Patrick Ho","Gary, maybe just following up some of the commentary you\u2019ve made about EUV on this conference call, particularly for the leading edge foundry and the increasing litho intensity in the near term. At the same time, as these leading edge nodes shrink to 10, 7 and 5 nanometers, we\u2019re seeing new materials implementation, stuff like cobalt for interconnects and other new processes being brought on board. Can you discuss a little more specifically Applied Materials capital intensity for its class of segment that even with EUV you will continue to see increases for your business segments on a going forward basis for leading edge logic and foundry?","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Thanks, Patrick. As I said earlier on N5 -- really for all the customers, every now they are driving power, performance, area and cost. 2D scaling is one of the ways that they are driving those improvements. And certainly shrinking is part of that; pattern placement techniques to place patterns in the right location are also part of that where we've said before we expect our patterning revenue to grow, we've grown significantly over to last several years. We do still see, if you look across the whole industry, our patterning share to continue to grow for Applied Materials. And then for power and performance, some of the things, I talked about earlier in N5, gate materials, epi, implant, surface treatment technologies. I will tell you, the interfaces are getting very, very difficult. And so, when you look at how you improve power and performance, you\u2019re talking about a few atoms making a very big difference. In some cases, you take wafers out of one process chamber immediately in a matter of seconds or minutes, you have moisture being absorbed into the films, oxidizing; that impacts device performance.","So, more of these integrated materials solutions will be the path in terms of how people drive scaling going forward. The 1,000x leakage current example I\u2019ve given is I think a prime example of a huge improvement in power and performance, and that requires a combination of technologies on a platform where Applied has a significant advantage. So, those are the areas we\u2019re focused on. We have many deep conversations with a number of different companies. I meet on a regular basis with all of the R&D leaders. And really, that's the focus for us and creates a big opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham and Company. Your line is now open.","Quinn Bolton","Gary, I just wanted to follow up on the market share comments. Obviously, the mix shift towards EUV hurt supply. But, if you look at the segments in which you compete today, what are your expectations for share gains? Are you flat to still gaining share in those segments? And then, sort of second question is just -- you talked about in the script, you are not yet ready to call the bottom. Just curious, what signs are you looking for before you're ready to call the bottom -- on the semiconductor side?","Dan Durn","Yes. On the semiconductor cycle and calling the bottom, I think what we're looking to in the back part of the year, we've got conversations, deep conversations ongoing with customers. And while we like some of the positive lead indicators we\u2019re seeing, we still see inventory at an elevated level coming down. And if we were to see that come down faster than we\u2019re currently contemplating, utilizations rising, ASP stability, I think those would be all good lead indicators that would look into the back half of 2019 and change the trend lines that we see. And again, if that is the scenario that materializes, we will benefit greatly in that environment.","Gary Dickerson","I think, on the market share question, certainly we\u2019re doing well in the areas we\u2019re competing. But we\u2019re driving to compete in more areas. There are certain areas where there are big TAM expansion opportunities. Those are areas that we\u2019re very focused on. And we\u2019ve talked many times about inflection-focused innovation. There is no question the playbook is changing going forward. It's not all about to 2D scaling. So, whether it's in advanced logic, specialty nodes, like power devices, CMOS, image sensors or scaling new memory technologies, all of those areas are areas that we\u2019re very focused on. They are all dependent on materials innovation. And we\u2019re driving major investments in those new products and also new structures that enable that new playbook. So, that's a big focus for us, and we see it is a great opportunity.","Michael Sullivan","Okay. Thanks, Quinn. Any last thoughts, Dan, before we close it up?","Dan Durn","Sure, Mike. Thanks. Just a couple of quick thoughts. First, I want you to know that while the environment is challenging, we feel very good about the structural WFE growth that we see in the years ahead. So, today, we\u2019re going to do the right things that increase the value of the Company. We will drive spend discipline throughout the organization while we\u2019re still investing. We're going to invest in new products and new capabilities. This is about winning, winning in new inflections that we know are going to play out in the growth years we see coming.","Second, even though we see some positive lead indicators based on conversations with our customers, we will resist the temptation to call the bottom. What we will do though we\u2019re going to stay close to our customers, we\u2019re going to continue to be transparent; we\u2019re going to continue to be available to you. On that point, we've got the Morgan Stanley conference coming up in a little less than two weeks. I\u2019ll look forward to seeing many of you there, and both Gary and I at many other events throughout the rest of the year.","Okay. Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, great. Thanks, Dan. And we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today. The replay of the call is going to be available on our website by 5 p.m. Pacific Time. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program.

Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you, Jennifer. Today, we will discuss the results for our second quarter, which ended on April 27. Joining me on the call are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements including our current view of the company\u2019s industries, our performance, products, share positions, profitability, announced business combination with Tokyo Electron and business outlook. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied and they should be interpreted in that light. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our most recent Form 10-Q, Form-8-K and other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements speak as of May 15, 2014 and we assume no obligation to update them.","Today\u2019s call also includes non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today\u2019s earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","Before we begin, I would like to make a calendar announcement. On the afternoon of Monday, July 7, Applied will hold its 2014 Analyst Briefing in San Francisco, with a live webcast for anyone who is not traveling to SEMICON West this year. We will provide you with more details as we get closer to the event.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. In our second fiscal quarter of 2014, Applied Materials delivered earnings near the high end of our guidance and we expanded our operating margins for the sixth quarter in a row. These results reflect healthy investment by our semiconductor and display customers, strong execution against our strategic plans and significant improvements in our financial performance. Across the company, we are focused on accelerating our momentum for profitable growth. We are strengthening our field technical engagements with customers, our R&D capabilities, and our ability to ramp new products faster with lower cost and better quality. At the same time, we are making great progress getting the organization ready for our merger with Tokyo Electron.","We continue to believe that we will receive regulatory approval for the merger in the second half of this year. Our S-4 securities registration statement has become effective and our shareholder meeting to approve the combination with Tokyo Electron is scheduled for June 23. The detailed plans to integrate our two companies are taking shape. The level of engagement and strong working relationships within the integration teams are tremendous. This gives us high confidence that we can rapidly bring together the critical areas that will enable the new company to achieve its strategic and financial goals. We have also been developing the mission, vision and values that will be the foundation of the combined company\u2019s culture and we will share more information about our progress at SEMICON in July. As we work through the integration planning process, we are even more confident that we can accelerate materials innovation for the industry and increase the value we deliver to our customers and shareholders.","Turning to our market outlook, evolving trends in mobility and connectivity are driving industry growth and accelerating innovation in mobile chips, solid state storage and interactive displays. The advanced processors, sensors and memory needed to enable high end smartphones have driven significant growth in the silicon content of these devices. Consequently, the foundries continue to make substantial investments as they ramp 20 nanometer capacity and accelerate their pilot lines for 16 nanometer and 14 nanometer FinFET technology.","We expect foundry spending to increase 10% to 20% in 2014 and be distributed over a broader customer base compared to recent years. Mobility and cloud computing are also driving demands for NAND memory and we expect bit growth to be about 40% this year. As a result of strong investments in advanced planar NAND, we believe total NAND spending could reach $7 billion for this year.","Adoption of 3D NAND is progressing at a slower pace than previously anticipated, but we still see increasing investment as customers work to solve technical challenges in a transition from planer to 3D devices. DRAM customers are also investing more as they upgrade capacities at their advanced nodes to meet demand for mobile DRAM. We expect 2014 DRAM spending to be 10% to 15% higher than last year. Overall, while there have been some adjustments in customers investment plans in recent months, we maintain our view that 2014 wafer fab equipment could be up 10% to 20% relative to last year.","In the display market, there are two primary factors driving growth. The first is TV, where average screen sizes are increasing at 1.5 inches to 2 inches annually, which is significantly higher than historic rates. Three, new Gen 8.5 factories are being built in China as our customers race to meet this growing TV area demand. The second is mobile, where displays are an important area of differentiation for smartphones and tablets. Higher definition screens are driving demand for low temperature polysilicon backplanes and we expect multiple new Gen 6 factories to be built in the next two years to meet the market\u2019s needs. These strong market drivers in display have enabled us to book $340 million of new orders in our second fiscal quarter and while we expect our revenue patterns to be uneven due to shipment timing, our outlook for the display business remains positive.","In semiconductor and display, new materials innovations are enabling key inflections by providing our customers with solutions that improve device performance, yield and cost. We see tremendous customer pull for Applied\u2019s differentiated technologies and precision film deposition, materials modification, materials removal and interface engineering margin which are at the heart of key transistor inflections. We are also working with our customers to drive significant materials innovation and interconnect.","Earlier this week, we launched our Volta CVD Cobalt system, this precision film deposition technology can be used to form CVD based cobalt liners and selective cobalt capping films that allow customers to overcome critical yield limiting issues as they scale copper interconnects at advanced nodes. This breakthrough strengthens our leadership position in interconnect, while growing the available market for Applied\u2019s CVD products.","Over the past 18 months, we have taken actions to support our growth strategy by shifting spending to our best opportunities, strengthening our processes and adding talent in critical areas of the organization. We have increased our technical capabilities in the field to better support new applications development for our customers. We strengthened our product development engine to accelerate new precision materials engineering innovations and we aligned our product portfolio to increase our focus on those programs that make the biggest impact for our customers and for Applied. We are starting to convert these actions and investments into market share momentum.","In calendar 2013, we gained 1.4 points of wafer fab equipment market share ending the year at our highest level since 2006. We delivered positional share gains across the majority of our leadership businesses. Our PVD business gained 7 points of share in the year. epitaxy gained 5 points while our implant, thermal and CMP businesses all delivered strong gains.","We also built positive momentum in areas that are large growth opportunities for us. We won 6 points of share in overall etch driven by gains in conductor etch. We continue to build momentum and expect to gain additional conductor etch share in 2014. Equally, our process diagnostics and control group is demonstrating its growth potential. We gained 5 points of share in wafer inspection and 3 points in litho metrology in 2013. And this past quarter, the group delivered its second highest revenue on record. We continue to see strong customer pull for our inspection technology, particularly in defect review. We are extending our leadership in this market with the strong adoption of our new G6 e-beam review tool. This market is also one of the fastest growing segments, with customers using the G6 more extensively to solve defect problems as they ramp new foundry and memory device technologies.","Across the organization, we are focused on creating a strong pipeline of new, highly differentiated products to enable future inflections in logic, memory, and display. While we are making the required investments to grow, we are also driving superior financial performance. And as Bob will explain in a few minutes, we are making good progress towards our 2013 Analyst Day models. We have reduced the impact of our solar business on our overall performance and expect our EES group will achieve breakeven or better performance for the year. We continue to strengthen the organization in many critical areas, attracting top talent in engineering and the field. We are increasing our focus on high-value services for our large installed base of tools. Our customers are planning to ramp challenging new devices in existing fabs. We see an opportunity to work with them to accelerate yield, improve performance, and drive lower cost for these new device technologies. And we are driving improvement in performance, time, cost and quality across the company, so that we can execute better and be ready to effectively scale after we combine with Tokyo Electron.","In summary, as we approach the midpoint of the year, 2014 is playing out largely as expected with global trends in mobility, connectivity, and display providing a strong foundation for customer investments in capacity and technology. We remained focused on applying our unique capabilities in precision materials engineering to enable major technology inflections for our customers. We are driving profitable growth, gaining market share, and making progress towards our long-term financial model. Our preparations to combine with Tokyo Electron are accelerating and we are incredibly excited by the opportunities this merger will bring for our customers, shareholders, and employees.","Now, I will hand the call over to Bob who will provide additional details about our performance and outlook.","Bob Halliday","Thanks, Gary. We have been highly focused on investing to drive profitable growth over the short, medium and long-term. We have also very tightly managed our spending to increase our product development and field technical support, while simultaneously driving for higher levels of profitability.","As Gary discussed, we gained market share in 2013. This progress was made with limited leverage from the new and disruptive products that have been funded and are making their way through the development pipeline to our customers. In fiscal 2014, we are on track for profitable growth, compared to the same period in 2013. Second quarter orders were up 16%, with SSG backlog at the highest level in the past six years. Revenue was up 19%. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was at the highest level in six years. Operating profit exceeded 20% for the first time in nearly three years and earnings per share increased 75%, significantly outpacing revenue growth.","We continued to focus on margin improvement even as we invest for growth. Our non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 44.2%, up 1.7 points sequentially, including 0.5 point of one-time benefits. We now expect to increase it by approximately 1.5 points in 2014 versus the prior year. R&D as a percentage of net sales has been running several points higher than in recent years. This is a headwind to our operating margins, which will become a tailwind as we introduce new and disruptive products in the future. Even with this higher level of investment, we are making progress towards our target operating model. All of our business segments delivered sequential operating margin improvement this quarter and the best performances in some time.","On a non-GAAP basis, SSG operating margins were the highest in seven quarters. AGS\u2019s were the highest in seven years. Display had its second highest result in 10 quarters and EES was profitable for the first time in 2.5 years. By focusing on margin improvement, even as we invest for growth, we believe we can deliver approximately 5 points of non-GAAP operating profit expansion for the year.","Next, I will provide more color on some of the changes in our Q2 results versus the prior quarter. Orders of $2.6 billion were up 15% as growth in display and SSG orders were partially offset by a decline in AGS orders, which reflected the seasonal timing of service contract renewals. Net sales of $2.4 billion were in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin of 44.2% grew 1.7 points including 0.5 point of benefit from the partial recovery of a customs assessment charge we recorded in Q4 2013. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $559 million were within our guidance and higher sequentially due to the absence of Q1 shutdown savings and the addition of merit increases.","We expect quarterly OpEx to be about $555 million, plus or minus $10 million for the remainder of the year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.7%, which was up from 22.5% in Q1. Both the quarterly rate and the expected annual rate have been impacted by a change in our forecast of regional revenue mix for the year. As a result, we expect the full year rate to be approximately 24%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 was in the high end of our guidance. Cash from operations of $437 million or 19% of revenue grew 17% reflecting higher profitability. We paid $122 million in dividends and ended the quarter with cash and investments up $313 million to $3.4 billion.","Next, I will comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders of $1.7 billion were up 6% with increases in DRAM and logic more than offsetting declines in foundry and NAND. SSG net sales of $1.6 billion were up 7%, in line with our expectations as increases in DRAM and foundry offset decreases in NAND and logic. SSG non-GAAP operating margins increased 3 points to 27.3% on higher volume.","AGS orders of $537 million were down 10% due mainly to the seasonal timing of service contract renewals. AGS net sales of $534 million were up 5% in line with our expectations. AGS non-GAAP operating margin increased over 3 points to 28.1% driven by higher revenue, favorable mix and the recovery of customs assessment charges.","In display, orders grew substantially to $340 million reflecting large orders related to new TV facilities in China. These orders should result in revenue growth later in the year. Display net sales of $147 million were down 8% in line with our expectations. Display non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1 point to approximately 18% reflecting operational improvements. EES orders were $88 million and net sales more than doubled to $88 million in line with expectations. EES non-GAAP operating income was $7 million.","Now, I will provide our third quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to down 5% sequentially. This range represents expected growth of 13% and 19% year-over-year. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be down 2% to 6%. This range represents expected growth of 17% to 22% year-over-year. AGS net sales should be flat to up 5%. We expect display net sales to be down approximately 20% and EES net sales should be up 5% to 10%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29.","In summary, we are investing for profitable growth and now on track for year-over-year increases in revenue and profitability. We are very excited about our planned merger with Tokyo Electron, which will provide us with more strong products and technologies to enable our customers\u2019 roadmaps, a larger installed base of systems to service, substantial economies of scale, and a unique opportunity to return more value to our shareholders. Applied and Tokyo Electron hope to see many of you in San Francisco on July 7. After the Applied Materials Analyst Briefing, we plan to hold a joint briefing to provide you with an update on our progress.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Mike Sullivan for questions.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks Bob. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow up. Jennifer, let\u2019s please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","There has been a lot of controversy in the market relative to how the year was to going to play out, especially relative to people\u2019s expectations as a couple of the bigger suppliers in the industry that have talked about weaker trends and then Lam and yourself have talked about things kind of stand pretty much as they were. Do you guys have any views as to what the differing views would be or why there is differing views from the major suppliers? Thanks.","Bob Halliday","I will take a shot at it, Jim. I will give you some data points. Number one, we did have strong orders in the quarter for both SSG and display and we ended the quarter with our highest backlog in years. So, that feels pretty good about little bit of wind at our back. Positionally, we are doing very well as a company on these transitions, whether they would be VNAND or FinFET. There has been speculation on a couple of concerns I think. One is some of the VNAND things may have pushed out and I think there is a general consensus, a little less spending in the short-term on that although we see that as very powerful longer term trend. But on the other hand, we do see a serious commitment by our customers to getting there on FinFETs. So, there might be a little bit of optimism coming on that in the intermediate term.","And then I think specific to Applied, as I mentioned we have the strong backlog. We have very strong display wind in our back also for both TVs and the smaller displays. And the solar business is doing okay for us. So overall, I would say there is a little bit of pushes and shoves, maybe a little bit of softness people have talked about, but overall we feel pretty good about our position.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, I would say also if we look at across the market with what we are hearing from customers, the foundry spending is expanding to additional customers above what they were in 2013. So, based on what we are seeing from customers and even some increase in demand short-term from some customers, we see that business being pretty good for 2014. NAND demand is pretty strong and again we see that up. DRAM, we also believe is up. Logic, we think maybe flat or down. But if you look at all of the different customers in the segments and you add it all up based on what we are saying, we are still in the range of the 10% to 20%, maybe it\u2019s more towards the bottom end of that range, but still in that range.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up and you guys had commented last quarter that you saw pretty healthy margin trends over the course of the year. Obviously, there is pushes and pulls based on what segments are spending and customers and timing and things of that nature, but how do you feel about the margin trajectory over the course of the year at this point?","Bob Halliday","Yes, I think we are making progress, Jim. You have to segment. Obviously, you segment it by our segments, that\u2019s obvious. And if you look at it, Solar is doing a lot better. I think the costs have come down. We are into the black there. Display is doing really well as a business. If you go look at \u2013 if you also look at AGS, the margins were up. Then you look within semi and we are making sustainable progress on some of the underlying things, which are the costs are somewhat down, the positioning is good, the new products are starting to appear. And then you have some mix issues that helped us a little bit on the quarter. We had a little bit less etch and we had that one-time Korean thing, but I would say underlying progress is pretty good. We think it will be pretty good next quarter and up on the year.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s great. Thanks so much. Good luck.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group.","C.J. Muse - ISI Group","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I know you guys don\u2019t guide to orders, but curious if you could talk about your visibility there, expectations for volatility there, and then how you see spending linearity for WFE first half versus second half of the year?","Bob Halliday","Yes. We don\u2019t \u2013 honestly, C.J., we don\u2019t give exclusive guidance on orders. We feel that the business environment is okay. I think it\u2019s not as a big concern as people say. We see pretty good strength in the second half. We see the FinFET stuff okay. As Gary said, the foundry spending is more spread out. I think to get greater visibility into the mix you have got to look below the top three guys. You have got to look at all those other spenders, the next four or five. And that strength year-on-year is more powerful than sometimes people focus on with the top three. So, I think the second half is okay. Traditionally, last few years, the fourth calendar quarter tends to be a little bit bigger than the third calendar quarter, but still too early to say.","C.J. Muse - ISI Group","That\u2019s helpful. And as my follow-up, as you build on the market share gains in silicon in 2013, how do you see yourselves in \u201814 relative to the market? Can you give some color on what kind of outperformance you think you can do in silicon?","Gary Dickerson","Yes, sure. We have had a really good start to 2014 in a number of different businesses. This last quarter was very good and we look over the next two quarters, it\u2019s kind of hard to see beyond the next six months. Those next two quarters also look pretty good for us. Major driver for the next few years is the transition customers are making in foundry and memory to dramatically different device architectures with FinFET and 3D NAND. These transitions are very good for us really enabled by materials innovation and we are optimistic that these transitions will grow our business and share as they happen. And beyond those leadership businesses, we are also seeing momentum in etch and PDC. And so you combine all of those factors together, we believe we are in a good position to grow our market share in 2014 and beyond.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company","....give us the SSG order breakdown by a customer bucket?","Michael Sullivan","Okay. Tim, sorry, your phone was on mute for just a moment. Do you mind repeating the question, so we can make sure we had it?","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company","Sure, Mike. Can you provide the order breakdown by customer type for SSG?","Bob Halliday","Yes. Let me look you out there on that one. I think what we said on the call was from quarter-to-quarter, foundry was \u2013 flipping pages.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company","Sure.","Bob Halliday","Yes, if you look at quarter-to-quarter as we said in the call, we had pretty strong orders overall but we found foundry Q1 to \u2013 if you want to hear about \u201813, I will tell you right now.","Gary Dickerson","So why don\u2019t we come back \u2013 Tim, do you have any other questions, when we get the data, we can come back?","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company","Okay. Sure, Gary. So Bob then the question just, I am trying to stick to the guidance, so it looks like you are guiding OpEx about flat, so to get to the middle of the EPS range it sort of implies the gross margin has to be up like 100 basis points sequentially on down revenue, is that the right math?","Bob Halliday","For Q2 to Q3?","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company","Yes.","Bob Halliday","Yes. We had pretty gross margins in Q2 and we think in Q3, we are pretty strong too. I don\u2019t want to be specific, but I think it\u2019s in the ballpark, slightly up a little bit, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 100 basis points.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company","Okay great.","Bob Halliday","Now, the other thing you got going Tim is you said the tax rate in the quarter, next quarter is probably a little lower because we guided for the year in 24.1%. And this quarter was 24.7%, so if you figure some benefit probably on gross margins, some benefit on tax, the math does the work.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company","Okay. Then if you guys get those SSG order breakout, that would be great? Thanks.","Bob Halliday","Yes and I will give you some color, so Q1 to Q2 as we said on the call, foundry was pretty strong in Q2, but not as strong as in Q1 bookings, our fiscal quarters, right. We had \u2013 DRAM was up a fair amount, flash is down slightly and logic and other was up.","Gary Dickerson","Go ahead Jenifer.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit Shah -Nomura","I wanted to ask about just the deal with Tokyo Electron, it seems like the markets maybe a little bit more skeptical about the deal closing versus how you guys are thinking about it and particularly around just the regulatory approval process in some of these major countries, Gary could you just share with us your thoughts on getting regulatory approval. And then what milestones we should be focused on beyond, I know you mentioned the filing as well as the shareholder approval meeting later in June, what else should we be focused on? Thank you.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Again, as we have more to announce, we will. But rather to their process, we really continue to expect the merger to close within the second half of 2014 and the process is proceeding pretty much as we expected. And we look forward to closing within the original timeline. The other thing I would say is that the level of engagement and working relationships within the integration teams are really tremendous. And as I also mentioned earlier that we really have increasing confidence that we can rapidly bring together their critical areas and enable the new company to achieve its strategic and financial goals. So again, from a timing standpoint pretty much similar to what we had originally communicated and no real change in expectations there.","Romit Shah -Nomura","And then can you \u2013 as you have spoken to some of your top customers about this deal, what\u2019s been the reception?","Gary Dickerson","We are not going to comment on all of those discussions. What we have said before is, those discussions went pretty much as we expected. And I have engaged with pretty much all of our top customers in the last month and there really have been no surprises in any of those discussions.","Romit Shah -Nomura","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned that your gross margin year-over-year should be up about 1.4 points and Op margin around 5 points, if that is the case is it fair to assume that Op margin level Q3 and Q4 would be flattish and would it imply sales to be flat Q3 to Q4 or am I reading too much into it?","Bob Halliday","Yes. Well, this is the trap I get into when I give full year numbers. I don\u2019t want to give Q4 guidance, Krish. We do want to give you some color, so I think our gross margins and Op margins in Q3 are in pretty good shape, I wouldn\u2019t see why they would go down in Q4, but I don\u2019t want to give specifics soon.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Got it. Fair enough. And then a question for Gary, I mean good job on the share gains last year, I am kind of curious you guys definitely had some pretty good share gain momentum in etch and process control last year and overall net share gain last year, I am kind of curious, after the deal is announced or has that share gain momentum continued the first five months of this year or over the last six months or do you think that share gain momentum has slowed down?","Gary Dickerson","Well, let me talk about etch first. We are really happy about the progress. We are making in conductor etch. We focused on investing in areas where we had the best opportunities to grow. And as we discussed this is paying off. As we discussed earlier with the 6 points of share gain last year, we have added a great talent into the team. The level of excitement is tremendously high. In the second quarter, we had the highest conductor etch revenue in the last seven years. And based on the interactions with customers, we believe that we will have further conductor etch share wins this year and continue to grow share in 2014 and beyond, so very, very good momentum in conductor etch. Inspection, last quarter we also had the second highest revenue quarter for PDC. And we anticipate 2014 could be a record year for this business, so very, very strong pull from customers in all segments including inspection and defect review.","I think one thing that people really maybe are not fully aware of is that we have leadership in e-beam review. We introduced the G6 e-beam review tool this year, very strong pull from customers extending our leadership. And this is also one of the segments that is the fastest growing as customers are focusing on how to solve defect problems as they make these major transitions in foundry and memory, so very strong growth in the market, in the total available market in e-beam review and very strong share position. So really in both of those businesses in 2014 the perspective is very positive.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you very much, Gary.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Securities.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Securities","Question, first just on the foundry piece, I was wondering if you could give us an idea of roughly how much of the foundry spend this year you think will be on 28 nanometer and above and how much might be on say 20 nanometer, 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer?","Bob Halliday","And so we think the Fin stuff is around 25%, right. I think we think the Fin stuff is around 25%, the 20 nanometer grouped in there is net above that.","Michael Sullivan","That 25% is going to be 28 nanometer still\u2026","Gary Dickerson","So most of \u2013 I would say 25% or so around FinFET technology this year. And really the bulk of the rest is 20 nanometer in 2014.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Securities","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I was just wondering on the cobalt cap announcement, it\u2019s really interesting, can you give us an idea of what you think the incremental revenue opportunity might be and then what the rate of adoption is by customers maybe just roughly by nodes, which nodes they may be introduced into?","Gary Dickerson","Sure, absolutely. So interconnect scaling is really a major challenge for customers, they need to fill smaller and higher aspect ratio of structures with good device performance and high yield and this is getting really hard for future devices. So to address these issues we developed the integrated cobalt liner and also a selectively deposited capping layer to enable customers to continue to use copper for future nodes. The cobalt liner is integrated on the same platform with our PVD chambers, which is a really great opportunity to expand our market in interconnect. And the capping layer is really a unique selective film similar to epi where we have a huge growing business and enabling new capabilities for customers. If you look at the size of the markets, you have two steps that will go across five different layers, so it\u2019s about 10 steps. And it\u2019s about a couple of million dollars for every 1K wafer starts roughly in terms of the size of the business. And this year in CVD we anticipate this is going to be a strong year. We anticipate gaining several points of share and part of that is this new Cobalt CVD film. So we anticipate very strong adoption in logic and foundry for really all of the customers and that will add a fair amount of business in 2014.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Securities","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","Maybe first going to the DRAM market and seeing the pickup in the CapEx spending as you look over the next couple of quarters and even to 2015 with some projected projects that are out there. Can you discuss the type of capital intensity you maybe seeing in future DRAM spending as it relates to your process segment versus some of the market share gains you maybe able to expect to gain in that customer segment?","Bob Halliday","DRAM, we think is up this year, Patrick. As we said, Q2 was up on Q1 for us in bookings. Q3 and Q4, we feel are better than Q1, but maybe not quite as good as Q2 for us. If you look at what\u2019s going on there, on the periphery stuff, we are benefiting particularly in medium current and high current implant as it gets more logic like there is all sorts of gap fill stuff going on that\u2019s helping us. We are going to be introducing cobalt with our PVD tools. Dielectric mesh looks good for us. And in etch we are making pretty good progress too. So, there is a bunch of transitions that are going on for us in the periphery, which is getting more logic like and also some of this capacitor stuff looks pretty good.","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe my follow-up question on the NAND side of things, what I was getting, I guess really customer specific, how do you see the challenges for most of the other players in terms of deciding to go to planar NAND versus their time of adoption or their rate of adoption of next generation 3D NAND?","Bob Halliday","Yes, what we see Patrick is really all of the customers are focused on the transition from planar to 3D NAND, because of the bit scaling opportunity that they have. Now, there are challenges in that transition. And we actually have a very strong position. In etch, that is really our strongest market segment, the planar and 3D NAND. And we have new applications that we are growing in that segment. We also have some unique technology that is focused on addressing the major challenges, yield challenges that customers have as they are making this transition from planar to 3D NAND, some new deposition technology. So, we really look at that being a really great opportunity. As we have talked about before the switch from planar to 3D NAND is really focused on thermal deposition and etch products. And we have made a lot of investment in those areas. We see this as a great opportunity for us to grow share as these transitions happen. What we have said is that our available market growth was 25% or 30% in the first generation. And then as you continue to scale the number of layers as they drive bit scaling that growth is even stronger for us. So, we believe that we are in a very good position as that transition happens. Now, it is the tough transition, but every single one of our customers are very focused really on technology buys to drive the development of that technology. Certainly we see 2015, the spending ramping a fair amount above what we see in 2014. So, most of the customers are really planning to ramp in \u201815 and \u201816. And this as we said is a very good opportunity for us.","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","(indiscernible) results, thanks for them. May I ask the question? Gary, I guess my first question as it\u2019s becoming clear that Moore\u2019s Law capital intensity is going up, you are starting to see your customers and your customers\u2019 customers kind of evolve their strategy. Last week, SanDisk kind of talked about a 3D CapEx spend that seems to be targeting flat dollars off of their \u201814 spend level intentionally. Talking about a longer period to ramp 3D, you have got Samsung this week talking about fully depleted SOI. I am just kind of curious as the economics start to become challenging and customers do things to extend nodes or slow progress, how does that impact kind of your view that you had at your Analyst Day in 2013 about a WFE number that can approach $37 billion?","Gary Dickerson","Well, Patrick [ph] as we talked about in the Analyst Day, we really sized our business at $30 billion. So, we are improving our profitability in our profile \u2013 sorry, we are really driving improvements in our business model at $30 billion. So, relative to the increasing CapEx spending, if you look at the planar to 3D NAND more spending is in the areas that are \u2013 where we participate and really where we have enabling technologies. So, you look at deposition etch and thermal processes that CapEx is going up and litho as a percentage is going down. So, that is a really very good opportunity for us.","The other thing I would say just as I travel around and I visited pretty much all of the major customers in the last month or two, the drive \u2013 this is a real war for mobility leadership that\u2019s happening. So, if you look at the memory area, the transition from planar to 3D NAND is a big bet that these different customers are focused on. And so they are all trying to get there first with the best technology. And the foundry competition is even more fierce, because people are focused on driving low-power, higher performance, more features. And so you look at this battle that\u2019s going on, we absolutely see stronger pull from those customers. And as you said that the CapEx does go up as they are moving to those new devices. Fortunately, for us, they are very heavily leveraged with our materials, precision materials engineering technologies. So, the transitions are good for us, but it is a big battle and a big bet for all of these different customers as they go through this transition. So anyway, John, those are my thoughts, I don\u2019t know, Bob, do you have any\u2026.","Bob Halliday","I think that\u2019s accurate. I mean, we do see increase in capital intensity. We do see it playing well in the areas, where we compete. We do see that our customers are competing and then things like FinFET and VNAND are very powerful devices down the road. Now, VNAND when they go to second generation, it probably becomes more cost effective than first generation. FinFET, we will have to play out a little bit. One of the more intriguing things that\u2019s starting to pop up on the FinFET stuff too is the interconnect which we talked about a little in the call. So, how it all plays out commercially in a couple of years, I am not sure. The other thing I think I said to you on an earlier call, John we are managing the company to achieve significant levels of profitability, a $30 billion wafer fab equipment, so that we are a very attractive company in terms of growing market share profitability at $30 billion to $37 billion.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yes, helpful guys. And then Gary I guess as for my follow-up, you guys have historically been well-levered to do the largest foundry in the world over in Taiwan. I am just kind of curious how I should think about your relative share at sort of some of the other foundries like Samsung and GLOBALFOUNDRIES as you talked about it in your prepared comments, the foundry customer base kind of broadens out in the back half of the year. How different is your share position was kind of the number two, number three guys versus the number one guy?","Gary Dickerson","Yes, John, really the foundry segment is our strongest segment really across the board. So, the more foundry is growing, that\u2019s really great for us. And we have a great opportunity as customers are introducing these new technologies, you gave more epi stuffs. You have a number of other areas that we talked about, the Cobalt CVD. A lot of these technologies we are seeing a broad adoption across all of these different customers. And so as this broadens out, that\u2019s very good for us as that mix shifts towards stronger foundry spending.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Perfect, thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS","Thank you. Yes. Maybe you could just follow-up on that last question on the sustainability of foundry orders coming from multiple customers. In your quarter, we saw two of your foundry customers announce a major strategic collaboration. I was just wondering historically have you seen these customer collaboration typically help improve order visibility in the near-term, but maybe this becomes a headwind for orders later on as they choose to build less fabs and do more sharing?","Bob Halliday","Yes, we have had some of this in the past, Stephen. You worry about all these things, because it\u2019s a reasonably big deal, but in the end it hasn\u2019t had huge impact. There are a few things going on that touch on what Gary just said. We do very well at places like foundry because we are enabling technology, if you look at PVD to metal gauge, look at epi, our products really help them solve, again as Gary says high value problem. So the benefit and value of our products is really high on foundries and particularly at inflections around metal gates, FinFETs and also in inflections in VNAND frankly. The inflection we are pursuing on DRAM is a little bit more in the periphery. So then if you go to customers consolidating, we have strong share in all the foundries and our enabling technology we had very high market share in those because we are enabling, so I think it will work out.","Stephen Chin - UBS","Okay. And then maybe for my follow-up question, just on the general silicon order trends, did you guys discuss that your silicon customer overlap is now close enough with Tokyo Electron, are you seeing the same big picture industry trends for silicon orders (indiscernible) after Tokyo Electron talked about I mean just a short order pause the June quarter with a recovery and maybe July, just wondering if you think you are close enough to them that you see the same big picture trends? Thanks.","Gary Dickerson","We really don\u2019t \u2013 we are not sharing any of that kind of information at this point, so I don\u2019t think we would have a perspective on that.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks Stephen.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Sullivan","Jenifer is Mahesh\u2019s line un-muted because we are not hearing him.","Operator","And Mahesh your line is open.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets","Hello.","Michael Sullivan","Hi.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets","Sorry, I was (on a) headset, I apologize. So on your backlog it looks like you are getting better visibility in terms of orders on silicon SSD, your orders were up 6% and you are guiding revenue down 4%, is it specific to a customer or some segment that you are getting better visibility on the orders?","Gary Dickerson","I think we just have some good timing on backlog. We have pretty good positions in share. So typically, there are typical customers who give you backlog and lead times that tends to be logic and a little bit more foundry, a little less so memory. But I think I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And another question on DRAM, we have seen a pretty interesting trend in DRAM, we have seen lithography and process control guys have not seen the strength you and Tokyo Electron and Lam has seen, is there anything going on technologically in terms of the transition to 25 nanometer and 20 nanometer that is driving more of deposition in etch versus litho and process control?","Gary Dickerson","Yes. Those are the areas that we see that are the strongest. I mean as Bob mentioned, the periphery is really changing to be more logic like, I mean it\u2019s lagging certainly the foundry and logic people by a couple of nodes, but we are seeing really strong pull for implant. I was just in Asia with one of our customers and really very, very strong pull as they are moving to next generation DRAM devices. We talked about cobalt, some other films for the capacitors, etch, different etch steps, so I would agree that those areas we are seeing pretty strong pull.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank","Yes, thanks for taking my question. So can you compare your market share in 3D NAND to-dare where you are in planar NAND and if you can give numbers, just through some general sense. And then also of that $7 billion in NAND spending for this year how much of that breakout to your 3D?","Bob Halliday","My memory is we are gaining share on both planar and 3D NAND. And I think our percentage of wafer fab equipment is slightly higher in 3D NAND because there is more deposition in etch. So our share of wafer fab equipment is up in both in \u2013 our share is up in both. The relative share is up more in 3D for two reasons. We are winning positions. And it\u2019s more deposition etch-intensive. In terms of the spending mix between the two, it was about 30%...","Gary Dickerson","30% this year. But as we talked about before there is may be 25%, 30% growth, just in first generation, I mean some people will also quote kind of what the growth is from planar to 3D NAND. But you really have to look at the number of layers in the stack, so for us it\u2019s 25%, 30% as you go to first generation 3D NAND devices. And we did see an increase in market share in the first customers that were moving from planar to 3D NAND. We didn\u2019t give an exact number and how much that share was going up, but there was a fair increase as we went through that transition.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank","And then I just want to probe further into AGS margins, which were pretty strong in this past quarter, can you talk a little bit more about what\u2019s driving that margin outperformance, is it mix, is there something else going on and is this how to think about the segment as a new normal?","Bob Halliday","Yes. The margins for AGS were strong. They were the beneficiary of that 0.5 point of gross margin improvement for the overall company that was a recovery of a Korean customs audit that we did well on, that we reserved in Q4 \u201813. So it\u2019s a little bit of one-time item in that. Generally, our AGS margins are doing better, I don\u2019t know if the current quarter is exactly going to stay the same for the foreseeable future probably because of that Korean customer\u2019s audit.","Gary Dickerson","Yes. One thing I would say, a couple of things I guess on AGS. If you think about what is happening with our customers in foundry and memory and in logic, they are making major transitions in device technology. So as they are moving to FinFET, they are moving from planar to 3D NAND. As they are shrinking these devices, defects become a bigger issue, uniformity becomes a bigger issue, edge die yield, tool stability. So for our customers to extend our large install base of tools as they are making these transitions, they are really pulling on us more and more and that really gives us an opportunity in AGS. The other thing is we really are making major changes in our organization to drive lower cost and also improve our ability in the parts business to grow that parts business, lower cost for customers and also providing parts that do give lower defects, better uniformity these types of capabilities. So we are making \u2013 really, it\u2019s a big drive for us and we see this as an opportunity for us to grow that business.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank","Great that\u2019s all for me. Thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company","Just wanted to revisit your \u2013 how your book to bill or booking versus revenue for SSG, it\u2019s been above 1 point for like three quarters, but you guys guided down, but I was just wondering, is it just based on timing of shipment. And then maybe some color on the linearity of shipment in the June quarter?","Bob Halliday","Well, the book to bill has been north of 1, as you said Edwin, we are guiding down on revs because even though we don\u2019t think there is any big time pause, it\u2019s typically the last few years that Q3 in terms of order trend isn\u2019t quite as high as other quarters. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big time pause, I think we are being helped by second tier buying, but it\u2019s probably off a little bit in orders.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company","Actually that\u2019s very helpful. And then just you talked a little bit about the etch and inspection share gain, sounds obviously very impressive, just curious, is there anyway you can kind of quantify where is it coming from, any particular area like foundry, memory or logic that you are seeing stronger pull on your customer side for those products. And as you integrate with TEL, do you see those two areas being further rooms for gaining share and area with the most opportunities or do you see other areas that you see, that you might have a lot of opportunity to gain share?","Gary Dickerson","Well, I think kind of the big picture for us is that these major technology transitions that are happening within foundry, logic, memory, huge changes in the transistor, from planar to 3D NAND, those \u2013 that\u2019s the big picture. And we talked about significant growth in PVD and epi and a number of different areas and we really see that continuing. There really are more steps that are being added as the customers are trying to drive device scaling and it is very hard for them to make these transitions. And really more and more focused on materials innovation, so I would say that is the major theme for us. And that provides a very good environment over the next few years as the customers ramp those new devices.","Now within etch, we were fortunate last year that we had the 6 points of share gain in overall etch. And really based on our gains in conductor etch and as I said earlier, we had last quarter the highest conductor etch revenue in seven years and we really have very strong pull from customers. Certainly in NAND flash, we see that market being very strong. We are also \u2013 we also anticipate that we will grow our business in foundry this year.","And then the other area that is an inflection is around selective material removal, where we have very strong products and we see that technology continuing adoption as the customers are implementing these new device structures. So, we really see a really great opportunity in etch for us to continue to grow in conductor etch. One of the things I talked about also is that we are not trying to boil the ocean. So, we have focused on the areas, where we thought that we had the best opportunities. And certainly, we saw that conductor etch was a great opportunity. We have very strong pull from customers in conductor etch and we have increased our investment, shifted money into that segment and that\u2019s where we see continued growth in 2014 and beyond.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company","Thanks. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you ","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark Heller - CLSA","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question on the foundry orders, the mix within that and also when you noted broader foundry spending in the second half, are we talking \u2013 is this mostly on FinFET spending or is it 20 nanometer or 28 nanometer?","Bob Halliday","Yes. What you are seeing in the second half, you are starting to get a little bit bigger pull recently for FinFET stuff. So, we said on the year, it was about 25% FinFET stuff across foundries and about 75% planar. The planar stuff was more weighted to the beginning of the year and the FinFET stuff is more weighted to the end of the year. And recently, it\u2019s been in public domain a lot last month or so. People have become a little bit more worried about VNAND timing this year versus next year. I think there is a little bit more pull recently for FinFET.","Mark Heller - CLSA","But are you seeing any increase in more lagging etch demand like 28 nanometer?","Bob Halliday","A little bit.","Mark Heller - CLSA","And the other question, any thoughts on the recent Samsung ST announcement with silicon-on-insulator, what is your view on that technology and the potential implications for equipment spending?","Bob Halliday","Yes, we know about silicon-on-insulator technology for a while now. It\u2019s been around for a while. It\u2019s hard for us to see a big inflection here, but we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time on it either.","Mark Heller - CLSA","Thanks. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Ben Pang with Northland Capital.","Ben Pang - Northland Capital","Thank you for taking my question. On the outlook for spending, I think you mentioned an answer to a previous question that you are looking at the low-end now rather than the high end of the range, what\u2019s the change \u2013 what segment has changed the most year-to-date?","Bob Halliday","I don\u2019t think we have changed a lot. We didn\u2019t change our range. We are probably a little bit lower in the range. I think it\u2019s the stuff people have talked about a little bit. NAND \u2013 the total NAND is a little bit off probably, not big time. We are still at around the $7 billion number, but a little bit and I think it\u2019s mostly timing between years also.","Ben Pang - Northland Capital","Okay. So, it\u2019s primarily NAND spending is where you see the \u2013 just to be clear about it, that\u2019s kind of where you guys also \u2013 this is not based on \u2013 I guess, this is based on your own view from your customers, correct?","Bob Halliday","Yes, it\u2019s in the\u2026.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, absolutely. And again, I think that as Bob talked about, timing really can make a difference as you get to an end of the calendar year and someone pushes out any of these technologies by one quarter, but we basically are in constant communication with our customers and the forecast that we have right now is pretty much aligned with what we hear from them.","Ben Pang - Northland Capital","On the flipside, what gets you to 20%?","Gary Dickerson","If you pull in, as they get more aggressive on FinFET or pickup NAND back to where they were.","Ben Pang - Northland Capital","Okay. And then one quick follow-up, on the capital intensity, you commented on lithography having lower capital intensity, is that because the number of critical layers is slowing down as you go to FinFET?","Gary Dickerson","No, we talked about really on 3D NAND versus planar and the feature sizes are increasing as that\u2019s the reason why they are going. Again, they are going to the 3D scaling versus 2D scaling. So, it\u2019s not shrinking the dimensions as there is the transition from planar to 3D NAND. So again, what we see from the big \u2013 our large customers etch, deposition and thermo processors are going up and litho because you are scaling vertically, not horizontally, the feature sizes are not as demanding and that is reducing the percentage of litho CapEx in 3D NAND.","Bob Halliday","Yes. It\u2019s more of a NAND discussion, Ben.","Ben Pang - Northland Capital","So, if I look at it for the total WFE space, even your guidance NAND, 3D NAND outlook is like 5% right of total, right like $2 billion or 7% or something of the total. So, the overall WFE waiting, do you really expect a big change in your sort of developed market, because litho goes down for this year?","Bob Halliday","Ben, you are saying, you think NAND spending is only 5% of\u2026","Gary Dickerson","No, Ben, again what we are seeing is\u2026","Ben Pang - Northland Capital","Yes, I think you guys have 7% and then 30% of that, right?","Gary Dickerson","Yes. So, what we are saying is basically when that transition happens, we are not talking specifically about the mix, where we did give those numbers on 2014, but as the 3D NAND ramps, our total available market goes up and then it\u2019s just a function of how much of that spending is happening in \u201814 versus \u201815 and \u201816, but definitely as that device ramps, that\u2019s good for us.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Ben. And Jennifer, we are running a little over. So, I would like to ask you if we have maybe two more questioners in the queue please.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson & Company.","Tom Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Company","In your outlook for the next year, how many new fab, the new greenfield fabs do you see versus just upgrades to existing facilities?","Gary Dickerson","Well, typically again when you say what ends up happening as the customers now will divide these investments into multiple phases. So, they are counting differently. Let me give you some color. So they are going to sort of these mega fabs for bunch of reasons. So, if you look at the Xi\u2019an Fab, the total Xi\u2019an Fab is I think 220,000 wafer starts in multiple phases. The total fab \u201814 build out eventually is over 200,000 wafer starts, I think. So, these mega fabs make it a little bit harder to count a greenfield fab, because they do it in phases now. If you look at wafer starts and pulling up that data, that\u2019s a fair amount. Do you have the wafer starts?","Bob Halliday","Five segments.","Gary Dickerson","So, if you look at \u2013 we think 3D is up to about 80,000 by the end of the year. That\u2019s including about 30,000 from last year.","Tom Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Company","Okay.","Gary Dickerson","And so wafer starts are up a fair amount. We have foundry there. I mean, foundry is up quite a bit too, but it\u2019s more about wafer starts than greenfield fabs, I think.","Tom Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Company","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Most of the good questions have already been asked. I will just ask couple of follow-ups. The first one has to do the breakdown of the backlog. Bob, I am looking at your display backlog is up 65% Q-over-Q and up almost 30% year-over-year and then on SSG, backlog is down 7% year-over-year. How should we think about the margin profile, especially some of these display equipments are shipped in the latter part of the year? And I am asking this because I am under assumption the display margins are much lower than SSG, so if nothing happens or nothing dramatic happens to the SSG backlog, how does the larger mix of display is going to impact the overall margin? And I have a follow-up.","Bob Halliday","There are a couple of things. Display backlog is up significantly, but year-on-year, I think the SSG backlog is also up. So, we are in okay, pretty good shape on both in terms of the mix. Gross margins are higher as you know in SSG versus display, but display operating margins have been trending up reasonably well. So, the gap isn\u2019t as big as it used to be. Third, the lead times for display equipment are much longer. So, I don\u2019t think we are going to have a big bump in our operating margins in any given quarter, because of unusual display disparities either in operating margins or in huge volume of business. I think it will be manageable.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Got it. And then one follow-up to your commentary about managing the business for WFE of $30 billion, should I assume that your SSG operating margin would grow back towards low 30%. I am looking at July of 2012, for the same revenue as you did in April of this year, operating margin was about 400 basis point higher. So, should we think about cost cutting to the point that you would be able to squeeze that much margin expansion?","Bob Halliday","Well, if you go look at the model, we showed you last Analyst Day July 7 or 8 last year, we trended up to 25% operating margins at $37 billion number. And now some people including John earlier on the call, was worried that it wouldn\u2019t be $37 billion environment. Our model, we showed also on that day was at a $30 billion environment. We are going to do about $22.5 billion. And so to make that model work between the $30 billion and the $37 billion, you need to have an improvement in SSG operating margin. As we said today earlier, across the whole company if you look at our spending in $8 billion revenue environment, which was 2004, \u201808 and sort of \u201812\/13, we are spending about 4 points higher as a company on R&D as a percentage of sales. And most of that\u2019s in SSG. So, we expect not only that our spending as a percentage of sales will be more favorable, but we will start to get growth in sales, especially in SSG as these new products hit the market. So, the short answer to your question is, yes.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, Mehdi, the other thing I would say is that we have talked before about shifting over $200 million maybe as much as $300 million of OpEx spending. EES is now getting back into the black. We have shifted a lot of money out of that. We have shifted a lot of money out of headquarters functions into the semiconductor R&D. So, the operating margins as you pointed out correctly are lower, but we really believe that those investments that we are making in SSG are important for our customers as they move to these new device technologies, FinFET, first generation, future generations, the interconnect technologies, new memory technologies. We really think those investments are important for our customers for the industry and we believe that we will get a good return on those investments. So, there is not going to be any reduction in that R&D spending in the near term.","Bob Halliday","Yes, I think that operating \u2013 to resonate what both of you said, I believe we can get to the type of numbers you are saying in a moderate spending environment. And I believe the way we will do it will largely be \u2013 we will start to kick in some revenue growth that we are investing in for now.","Michael Sullivan","Great. So, Mehdi thanks for your question and we would like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we would really hope to see many of you in San Francisco for the SEMICON West briefing on July 7, the afternoon of July 7.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you, Mike. Today, we'll discuss the results for our third quarter, which ended on July 27. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including our current view of the company's industries and our performance, products, strategies, opportunities, announced business combination with Tokyo Electron and business outlook. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied, and they should be interpreted in that light. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our most recent Form 8-K and 10-Q filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak as of August 14, 2014, and we assume no obligation to update them.","Today's call also includes non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary E. Dickerson","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. In our third fiscal quarter, Applied Materials delivered earnings near the high end of our guidance. We are demonstrating substantial progress toward our long-term financial model, having now improved operating margins for 7 quarters in a row.","During the same period, we have stepped up our investment in research and development to create a pipeline of new product that will enable our customers' future success and drive long-term growth for Applied.","We are in the middle of the biggest changes in semiconductor and display technologies in decades, and these major technology transitions are enabled by materials innovation. This plays directly to Applied's unique capability in precision materials engineering. Our strong operating and financial performance is supported by sustained investment in capacity and new technology by our customers.","Across the company, we are building momentum for profitable growth. We have focused our strategy and investment in areas that have the largest impact for customers and generate the best returns for Applied. We are driving execution of our strategic plan by focusing on alignment and speed. And we are placing a significant emphasis on getting the organization ready to scale by ensuring that we have the right talent in the right areas.","The actions we are taking benefit us today and pave the way for rapid integration with Tokyo Electron. The merger with TEL accelerates our existing strategy by bringing together both companies' complementary strengths to create an expanded set of capabilities. This will enable us to be a higher value partner for customers by delivering more innovative products faster and at lower cost.","We are engaged in dialogues with regulators around the world, consistent with our goal of closing the merger before the end of the calendar year. During this phase, we have been advised not to provide details or answer questions about ongoing discussion.","Turning to our market outlook. Mobility and connectivity trends continue to drive significant growth and accelerate technology innovation in both semiconductor and display.","In foundry, the broadening of spending this year and the build-out of the 28- and 20-nanometer nodes is fueling record performance for our transistor businesses. The next major focus for foundries is FinFET, and we believe this will provide a catalyst for a new wave of investment in 2015, as customers start to ramp this technology.","In memory, overall investment levels remained strong. NAND bit growth is expected to be around 40% this year. While the bulk of this incremental demand will be met by investments in advanced planar technology, customers are now publicly discussing their road map for 3D NAND to achieve cost parity with planar NAND. Based on what customers are telling us about their future investment, we believe the bit scaling advantages of 3D NAND, combined with performance improvement, will fuel 3D NAND spending in 2015 and beyond as more manufacturers move to this new technology. As we have said before, this transition to 3D materials-enabled devices is very positive for Applied, expanding our available market by 35% to 50%.","In DRAM, we see supply tightening. Lower-power mobile DRAM shipments are expected to grow about 60% this year. And in parallel, there are indications that an enterprise-driven PC refresh cycle is underway. As a result, DRAM investment is increasing. We expect technology conversion to provide the 30% bit growth needed this year while seeing strong potential for new capacity additions in 2015. We anticipate overall memory spending being up approximately 30% in calendar 2014. And in addition, we believe we will grow our share with memory customers by more than 2 points this year.","Looking at the market as a whole, we maintain our view that 2014 wafer fab equipment spending could be up 10% to 20% this year. We also believe that 2015 will be stronger than 2014, as the foundries ramp FinFET, more customers invest in 3D NAND and DRAM spending increases.","In Display, 2014 is shaping up largely as expected, with strong investment in capacity and new technology. This is being driven by mobility, where higher resolution displays are becoming a major battleground for smartphones and tablet and TV, where average screen sizes are growing significantly faster than historic norms. In the past 2 quarters, we booked over $600 million of display orders, which is over $100 million higher than we expected at the start of Q2.","In semiconductor and display, the major device technology changes that are taking place are enabled by materials innovation, and this provides a great opportunity for us. Over the past 18 months, we have aligned the company around our precision materials engineering strategy to drive growth at Applied Materials. Central to this strategy is the rapid development of enabling product, and we are very pleased with how our current portfolio and future pipeline are taking shape.","This quarter, our metal deposition product business delivered its highest revenue in 14 years. Epi, one of Applied's first products, posted its highest sales for any 12-month period in our history. Epi remains a key enabler for next-generation transistors, and we believe the applications for Epi technology will grow significantly in the future.","We are gaining share in both etch and CVD and expect our combined revenue in these markets to grow by approximately 40% in calendar 2014.","We are also building traction with our selective material removal technology and now have tools at 5 large customers.","Across the company, we are driving actions that allow us to move faster and scale the organization. We are strengthening our teams and processes in the field, product development and operation. This is enabling us to see inflections first and deliver solutions to our customers faster. We are in the process of making changes to our structure to better align the field, R&D, service and operation while getting ready for our combination with Tokyo Electron.","To drive repeatable success, we have trained over 3,500 engineers and technologists across the company while investing in the development of our general managers and marketing capability. As technology transitions get harder for our customers, we are seeing strong pull for our service business.","We have made significant changes in our service organization to deliver better device performance and yield, as well as more competitive cost for our customers as they ramp complex, new device technology. By building our capabilities in areas that help customers ramp new technologies faster and at lower cost, we anticipate AGS will deliver high single-digit revenue growth this year.","As Bob will explain in a few minutes, we are converting our focus on alignment, speed and scaling into superior financial performance. The progress we are making towards our 2016 financial model is driven by strong demand for our most enabling products in transistor and interconnect; improving performance in our businesses that are growing the most, including etch, CVD and display; and actions we have taken to limit our exposure to the downturn in the solar market.","To summarize, Applied has great opportunities, as we are uniquely positioned to apply our differentiated capabilities in precision materials engineering to enable major technology transition. We are only at the beginning of these inflections. The ramps in FinFET, 3D NAND and new display technology will be the next of multiple waves of investment by our customers. We remain highly focused on execution to ensure that we can take full advantage of these opportunities and can rapidly scale the organization when we merge with Tokyo Electron.","Our teams around the company have already accomplished a great deal. The progress we are making towards our strategic and financial goals would not be possible without the hard work and passion of our global employees.","Now, Bob will provide additional details on our performance and outlook.","Robert J. Halliday","Thanks, Gary. As Gary discussed, we have aligned the company around a growth strategy that is creating a pipeline of differentiated products to enable our customers' success as they make unprecedented technology transition.","Before I get into the detail of our third quarter results, I'll spend a few minutes talking about our focus on execution and how this is translating and will continue to translate in stronger financial [indiscernible].","Let me provide some details about how we are executing better and faster in key areas [ph], how we are making sustainable improvements in our operating model and how these improvements are translating into stronger financial results. Here are a few examples of better, faster execution across the company.","In SSG, market share gains are being helped by a significant reduction in our product development cycles. In AGS, we are driving profitability improvement with the introduction of new device performance and field service products and tighter alignment with SSG. In Display, we reduced our factory overhead costs and inflation cycle time. In EES, we expect to be above breakeven and cash flow-positive [indiscernible] the year. And for the company as a whole, we have been reducing our tax rates for the implementation of a more efficient tax structure [indiscernible].","Now let me give you some examples of the sustainable improvements we are making in our operating [indiscernible]. We have increased resource allocation to SSG and display, areas where we have superior opportunities to grow revenues and margin. Within SSG, we have increased our focus on the products that are most enabling to customers [ph] and where we have great opportunity to grow. These areas include Epi, CVD, etch, inspection and PVD. And we are relentlessly focused on reducing materials and overhead [indiscernible]. For the year, we're on target to achieve a 2% reduction in material [indiscernible].","Our strong execution is translating into improved financial [indiscernible]. On a non-GAAP basis, Q3 gross margin was at a 6-year high, and our full year gross margin will be up 2 points, approaching 44%. Q3 operating margin was at a 3-year high. The full year results could be up by 6 points. The fiscal year tax rate could be down by 1 point or more and is making progress towards our 22% target. And operating cash flow was at a 3-year high.","Our focus on execution, alignment and speed is translating into stronger financial results today, enabling us to make solid progress toward our long-term model and getting the organization ready for our combination with Tokyo Electron.","Now I will provide more color on our third quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.5 billion were down 6% sequentially, driven by SSG orders, which tend to be seasonally slower this time of year [ph]. Compared to the third quarter of last year, orders were up 24%. And our book-to-bill ratio was greater than 1 for the seventh consecutive quarter. Backlog was almost $3 billion, with SSG backlog at a new 6-year high and Display backlog at a 5-year high. Net sales of $2.3 billion were near the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin increased to 45.5% in Q3, which included 0.8 points in non-recurring benefits. Even excluding these benefits, gross margin improved by 1 point [ph] [indiscernible]. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 was near the high end of our guidance. Our operating cash flow was $584 million or 26% of revenue. Next, I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter.","SSG orders of $1.6 billion were down 6%, with decreases in DRAM and foundry, more than offsetting small increases [ph] [indiscernible]. SSG net sales of $1.5 billion were down 7%, slightly below our expectation due to some changes in the timing of customer fab. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin increased 1.4 points to 28.7%, reflecting favorable mix. SSG's operating margin performance was at the highest level in almost [indiscernible] years.","AGS orders of $552 million were up 3% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. AGS net sales of $567 million were slightly higher than expected, an increase of 14% [indiscernible]. AGS non-GAAP operating margin decreased slightly to 27.2% and remained near the highest level in 7 years [ph].","Display orders of $296 million were the second-highest in the past 6 years [ph]. Display net sales of $119 million declined, in line with our expectation. While backlog grew at very high levels, in anticipation [indiscernible]. Display non-GAAP operating margin increased by over 4 points to 22%, including a benefit from the sale of some previously reserved [indiscernible]. Display's operating margin was the highest in the past 3 years [ph].","EES orders were $66 million. Net sales increased to $103 million. EES non-GAAP operating income was $25 million, including the benefit of favorable litigation outcome.","Now I will provide our fourth quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat, plus or minus 3%. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be down 1% to 7%. AGS net sales were flat to up 4% [ph]. We expect display net sales to be up over 60%, and EES net sales should be down approximately 35%. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 44%, which would be up almost 2 points year-over-year. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million, plus or minus [indiscernible]. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 25% to [indiscernible].","In summary, our strong financial performance and the progress we are making towards our long-term model is being supported by sustained investment by our semiconductor and display customers; our precision materials engineering strategy, which is focused on enabling major technology transitions for our customers [ph]; and our focus on improving execution, alignment and speed.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Mike Sullivan for questions.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of them. There's a couple of new DRAM fabs that are being built out, and, of course, there's a much discussed build-out from one of the other foundries, who's trying to play a little bit of catch-up on FinFET. Could you guys give us a little bit of perspective on the timing for new orders for those projects? I know, in particular, on the foundry project, different equipment suppliers have seen those orders at different times. So I'm wondering how much of that is still on the come versus how much of that you might have already seen, and then same thing on the DRAM side.","Robert J. Halliday","Sure. The big drivers of the technology transitions we talked about earlier [ph] [indiscernible] FinFET and VNAND. And if you look at FinFET, still very positive. I think it's a little more heavily weighted to early '15 and late '15 [ph]. If you look at VNAND, some of that has been slipping from [indiscernible]. DRAM was [indiscernible].","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then if I could follow up. You guys have done a terrific job on the gross margins. I think that you had commented at SEMICON that it was the highest gross margin -- quarterly gross margin in 6 years, then you guys did another nice bump-up this quarter. What are the biggest incremental drivers of gross margin from here? Is it just volume, mix or lower component costs? Or how would you categorize the bridge between where you are today and wherever you might be able to go? Because it's been very impressive so far.","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, there's 2 sets of opportunities, Jim. The one that is most disruptive and sexy and attractive is interesting new disruptive products that are really valuable for [ph] customers. And those, frankly, are starting to come, especially next year, we'll see more of that. The progress we made to date is just managing very tightly [ph]. If you look at our gross margins across virtually every segment of AGS, solar, Display and Semitool [ph]. So it's blocking and tackling, reducing operating costs, reducing the build costs, better mix -- driving better mix in terms of your revenue and sales, better mix between segments. So I think these systemic things, just grinding away at mix, cost issues, positioning and betting on the right products is going to help us quarter in, quarter out for the next several years. I think the disruptive new product is coming out more next year. So we see 2 opportunities there, one is pretty systemic and one is [indiscernible].","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, what I would say also, Jim, is that the -- as we've talked about, these transitions are really in the sweet spot for us, with all of the precision materials, engineering, technologies and products that we have. And, really, the customer pull is stronger than we've ever seen. Our percent of the TAM increases as some of these materials-enabled devices start to ramp. So as Bob said, that's the key strategic issue for our customers, and that's really what gives us a great opportunity to grow our business over the next few quarters and over the next few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from ISI Group.","Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question, I was hoping to get an update on integration efforts with TEL. You provided some great info at SEMICON and prior to that; would love to get an update there.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes. On the -- thanks for the question, C.J. On the merger, we're absolutely convinced that this is the right strategy to bring more value for our customers, drive innovation with better products, faster and lower cost. And I think as we continue to work together, we're more and more convinced of that. And that really is accelerating our existing strategy in materials innovation and really focused on the key challenges, the key strategic challenges that our customers have. So that's been going very well. The integration planning has really been tremendous. We talked, as you said, last month a lot about that relative to the organizational structure. We're aligned on the culture and the mission, vision and values, the operating rhythm. And what I've seen is just a continual building of those relationships and excitement of all the key people on both sides. So really just tremendous progress ahead of where we thought we would be at this point.","Robert J. Halliday","I agree with Gary. I think the mechanics of the integration, which seemed to be your question, C.J., is going actually really well, better than I would have expected. The engagement by the teams has been really good. Working relationships have been strong. Sort of the rhythm of it in terms of operating organization, how we'll do business together has been pretty darn positive. I think we see line of sight to the synergies. Pretty damn good, I'd say.","Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And if I could ask a follow-up. It looks like revenues came to the low end of the range, and the culprit was silicon. And at the same time, your backlog actually grew there, I think, 4%. So curious, how should we think about the time frame of recognizing revenues there? And does that suggest a strong January quarter and\/or does that kind of bleed into the first half of '15?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, we do have a really strong backlog, actually, in SSG and Display. We've been talking about the display backlog and the orders build for a couple of quarters. We're going to start to get some significant benefit for the Display backlog in terms of the revenue line next quarter. SSG backlog will help us next quarter, but I think some of that benefit will also go into fiscal [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Farhan asking a question on behalf of John. My first question is regarding the breakup of orders within SSG. Did you provide a breakup between NAND, DRAM, foundry and logic? I may have missed it on your commentary.","Robert J. Halliday","We didn't provide.","Michael Sullivan","Yes, it's in the press release, Farhan, so we can definitely point it out to you later and...","Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No, that's fine.","Michael Sullivan","Okay.","Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then in regards to 2015 expectation, you talked about a significant ramp in 3D, and also, on DRAM side, you're persisting that there could be a pickup as the capacity additions may possibly resume. From -- in terms of your outlook for 2015, which segments do you expect to grow most? If you could just give us a sense of is there strength more in foundry or is it more in memory?","Gary E. Dickerson","So first of all, 2015, we think will be an up year, as we talked about before. Kind of the major changes that are happening in '15, we see that the investment in FinFET technologies are going to pick up a fair amount. Should be -- our current forecast is something like 50% of the foundry business we'll be investing for those technologies in 2015. And we see foundry investment may be up slightly in 2015. The memory business for both NAND flash and DRAM, we see both of those being up. And also, as we talked about before, we see 3D NAND investment in '15 increasing significantly from where we're at in 2014. So those are the major drivers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things. Bob, I wanted to ask about the performance of the company this calendar year versus what your financial model is. And I understand that the financial model is a 2016 model, so maybe the answer is just time. But this year, you're going to do with like -- WFE is sort of in the low-30s, maybe it's $32 billion, I think, is what you guys are now saying. You're going to do somewhere in the $1.10 range, if you assume that the January quarter is not like heroically up or down. And your financial model has you doing $1.50 at $30 billion WFE. So my question is, what is going to happen or sort of what has to happen to get from where you are this year to where the financial model says you'll be? Because there still seems to be a big gap.","Robert J. Halliday","I've got to check the math. I didn't know if it's $1.50 at $30 billion, frankly. This year, it's about a $31.6 billion to $31.9 billion WFE. So if you look at -- we got a gain [ph]. We said in the model we're going to get to 19.9% wafer fab equipment in SSG. We ended last year at 19.1%. We haven't forecasted it this year. But the year before, it's 17.7%; we gained [ph] 1.4% through last year in wafer fab equipment. We continue to be optimistic that we'll get to the 19.9% [indiscernible] model. The second thing is gross margins. I think at the $30 billion model, we were at like 44%, 45%. In the quarter just ended, we did 45.5%. This year, we'll probably be about 44%. So it's a little higher volume, $31.6 billion versus the $30 billion model. So we're actually getting there. OpEx, I think, in the $30 billion -- I'm doing this from memory, Tim. I think it was like a 2 2 [ph] or something like that.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","2 1 [ph].","Robert J. Halliday","2 1 [ph]. So right now, we're trending to be about 220 [ph] on the year so we did about $100 million [ph] extra expense. Just a little 450 [ph] spend in our numbers and then we've got some managed expenses and inflation a little bit, so we're off [ph] about 100 [ph]. Tax rate, we said, would be 22% in that model. And right now, we're running a full year, I think we're going to end up around 23, 24 [indiscernible]. So -- and I feel pretty good about the 22% getting there. So if you look at -- I think we're about 70% on track. [indiscernible] we've got to get a little more share gain, a little more gross margin, manage down expenses a little bit [indiscernible]. Let me just check the math. I guess we are [indiscernible], but those are the levers, I think about 65%, 70% there. Yes, you're right, it is $1.50[ph].","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Awesome. Okay. And then just a follow-up on the fourth calendar quarter. If you look at the numbers that Semi puts out, the run rate for Q1 with WFE was like $34 billion, $33 billion, $34 billion. Q2 is like $30 billion. And then most companies, including you guys, are sort of guiding Q3 down just a touch. So maybe you're sort of in the $30 billion range. So if the full year is going to be $32 billion, then the fourth quarter has to be a pretty good quarter to get you to $32 billion for the year. Is that what you see right now, that the fourth quarter is going to be up pretty sizably in SSG?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, we haven't guided to a Q1 yet, but we think Q1 is probably stronger, fiscal Q1 for us, right, which is November, December. It's been that way pretty often in recent past. And if you think about -- we talked about earlier, Tim, about technology transitions, VNAND and FinFET. They slipped down [ph] a little bit on the -- in the middle of this year, but they still look very committed to those. So my guess is that the fiscal Q1 for us or the calendar Q4 for the industry is probably [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Given the complexities, both process development and yield ramps associated with some of these next-generation technologies, it looks like your take rate and attach rates on services is growing nicely. I think you guys said you anticipate high single-digits percentage growth this year. Given what appears to be a continuation of this complexity trend, would you expect similar type of growth going forward? And at this type of growth rate, are you guys driving OpEx leverage?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes. So we definitely see opportunities in the service business. As customers are going through dramatic technology transitions in foundry and in memory, it really creates a great opportunity for us. We've done a lot in terms of aligning our service strategy to those opportunities. We've changed the organization structure. So there's tighter alignment between SSG and AGS. So we're really focused on those device performance and yield and cost challenges. As customers are making those transitions, we're seeing good response from customers, so strong pull for those types of capabilities. As customers are making these transitions, getting the particles to the level they need to be to get good yield, edge die yield, uniformity, all of these things are harder and harder. And we're aligning our company and our strategy and our structure to really provide more value for our customers and drive those opportunities. So we see, as we said, the single-digit revenue growth this year. So we really see this, as you talked about, as a great opportunity for us to continue to drive the service business going forward. And there -- we see a lot of leverage also as that business grows.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then on the selective removal platform, I think at SEMICON, you pegged this as about a $1 billion opportunity. You talked about tools being placed with 5 large customers. What technology nodes are your early customers looking to use this solution in high-volume manufacturing? And is it more targeted for front-end-focused or back-end-focused applications?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, thanks, Harlan. So we've always seen some cases where customers are putting the selective removal technology into production, but we really see this more as you go forward to some of these future device technologies. Especially, we've seen adoption of this in memory. And there are a number of different potential opportunities in patterning. You have things like pattern collapse. As you're going vertical to the taller 3D types of structures with the tighter design rules, that's where you start seeing the current technologies running out of gas and an opportunity for us to implement the selective removal technology. So we do see some already, layers going into production with this technology. Certainly, we'll see it ramping next year, and then probably the year after that, even stronger adoption.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes, the spending environment has been under a little bit of pressure recently, but we're seeing what I think is just a higher level of stability in your revenues compared to some of your peers. And I'd love your perspective on that. Is that just seasonal or do you guys see your businesses inherently being less cyclical?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, I think, generally, the semi industry is a little less cyclical, a little more seasonal, as you go to more and more consumer products for the chip versus [indiscernible]. So I think that's true, and I think a lot of people believe that. I think the Display business, half of it or 60% of it is kind of cyclical big TV size, more TV capacity added. I think there's a little bit more systemic growth on the smaller screen sizes, phones, iPads, things like that. So net-net, between Semi and Display, I think we're trending more seasonal versus cyclical, historically. And the other thing that's going pretty well for us: the service business looks like it's going to get [ph] some growth. And also the solar business, the growth is moderate, but the profitability is [indiscernible].","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And your SSG revenues were a little bit lighter, but margins were a lot better. Bob, you mentioned mix. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on what was it within the mix that drove the better margins there.","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, a couple things. One, I think -- the revenues, I was actually, in hindsight, in SSG, relatively pleased. We had strong bookings. Revenues were a little under what we thought, but there were things that transpired in the quarter that happened there that we managed it pretty well. And then if you look at our peers, our guide and our actuals sort of our second quarter, our third quarter and even our third quarter through our fiscal fourth quarter, we compare pretty well, actually. So the revenues in SSG and the company are holding up okay. If you look within SSG revenue mix model, which you're asking on the margin, we're making some progress in most of the products and some margin, cost reduction, efficiency, selling more upgrade products. It's all of the execution things you think about every day. So the gross margins are trending up a little bit. Now what we're very optimistic about is the money we've invested last year, last couple of years, really, in R&D and SSG because we put a heavy weighting of that this year on 300-millimeter products versus 450 last year. We think those are going to give us some more lift on opportunities in the revenue and gross margin line of product [ph].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The first one I have was for Gary. If you look at the 3 big technology inflations next year, 3D NAND, FinFET and multi-patterning DRAM, in your WFE assumption, which do you think is -- in terms of dollars, which do you think is going to be the biggest? Do you think 3D NAND or FinFET?","Gary E. Dickerson","In terms of dollars, the FinFET -- or the foundry spending is going to be higher than 3D NAND. And what we see in both the FinFET and 3D NAND is a real strong transition to both the FinFET as a percentage of that spending and also 3D NAND as a percentage of the NAND flash spending. So in both cases, we think that the spending for those new technologies are going to be around 50%. And as we've said before, that's very positive for us because we have great products in enabling new transistor technologies. And 3D NAND is really materials-enabled versus litho-enabled. So it's very heavy in areas where we have a very strong position. So in both cases, we see about half of the spending next year being those new technologies. Foundry is about 2x the total spending versus 3D NAND. So that would mean that the FinFET is more heavily a percentage of our revenue versus 3D NAND.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared comments about capacity additions in DRAM next year, despite just technology changes this year. So next year, when you look at capacity additions, can you try to quantify or help us quantify, in terms of wafer starts or [indiscernible], what do you expect for DRAM capacity has to be in calendar '15?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, what we see in DRAM next year is up some versus 2014. But if you look at '13 to '14, the WFE spending really is going up pretty dramatically. We have it up in the 30% to 45% range in terms of total WFE spending in DRAM. And we see it up slightly, maybe less than 5% next year, is our current view. And on the capacity versus technology, we see it much heavier-weighted in capacity buys versus technology buys in 2015, but that's our current view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the segment operating margin. Maybe to start with, if, Bob, you can maybe share some color on the rising of unallocated corporate expenses. Is that mostly due to merger with Tokyo Electron? And does that go away after the merger is completed? So maybe there's room for additional operating margin improvement from that corporate line?","Robert J. Halliday","So if you look at GAAP versus non-GAAP, we have a couple of points spread between our GAAP and non-GAAP PVD [ph], the tax income. It's actually -- generally, the spend just gets tighter, but there's about -- most of that is the Tokyo Electron. And then we also have this corporate sometimes under the bonus plans. I think a lot of that you're looking at is a non-GAAP related to [indiscernible] merger costs [ph].","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a follow-up question on the improving gross margin. How much are gross margins benefiting from this diversification of spending by the customer base, especially in foundry? The question is, can gross margin possibly see another tailwind as customers not named Intel or GSMC or Samsung memory become a biggest piece of your sales?","Robert J. Halliday","Let me go back to give you the answer I gave before and then give you more color first [ph], Stephen. What we've done to date is we've done a lot of good blocking and tackling with places like EES, where we have -- get the cost down, get -- run it back at a rate in business and raise gross margin [ph] that contribute to the company. If you look at display, it reduced their overhead costs and getting valuable products. The whole mix of things have done well. If you look at AGS, trended up a little bit with gross margins there, too. So it's all of the blocking and tackling across the company. So you can't pick a heroic thing, you just look at good blocking-and-tackling and execution and a broad range of activities. Within SSG, specifically, where you're talking about, there's things -- blocking and tackling probably helped us some. The second thing that helps and hurts periodically in the quarter is just mix of the individual products. So we're actually gaining share in etch, which we talked and we're very pleased with. But the gross margins are a little bit lower in these early etch tools. And it's not pricing, it's just etch is always a little bit lower for us the last 20 years. So the mix within quarters, once [indiscernible], the systemic thing in SSG, the blocking and tackling is getting better, new products are coming, which will help SSG, you have timing mix quarter-to-quarter, which is a plus or minus. Now the question you're asking is mix between customers. We don't typically talk about mix between customers. Configurations are different, the mix of product sales is different. But generally, we think we're in line to sell a more valuable set of product volumes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sundeep Bajikar from Jefferies.","Sundeep Bajikar - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Would you please provide your perspective on Applied's Display business in China? What's your outlook for new investments in display technology from China over the next year? And how would you characterize the competitive landscape over there for display equipment? As part of that, perhaps also help us understand if there are any major synergies between Applied's Display business and Semiconductor business in China.","Gary E. Dickerson","Thanks, Sundeep. The business in China for display is definitely very strong. And as we've talked about before, our customers are going through transitions in amorphous silicon, to LTPS, to metal oxide and organic LED types of display technologies. Our market share performance in display is really exceeding our expectations. We have very strong products, as customers are ramping these new factories and ramping these new technologies. So we're -- China is a big percentage of our business right now. I think we recently announced an order where we had 100% market share in one of the big factories there. So overall, we're very, very optimistic about display. We talked also about the last 2 quarters having more than $600 million in orders. So the overall momentum there is very good. And as Bob talked about, the team is really outstanding. They're executing really well in terms of their new product introduction. They've cut their install cycle times down dramatically. A lot of different things they're doing there not only from an innovation standpoint but also from an execution standpoint.","Sundeep Bajikar - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. That's very helpful. And just to follow up, how much exposure does Applied have to flexible OLED display? If we see a product in technology ramp in flexible display, say, in the next 6 to 12 months, is there a chance we would see it impacting Applied's fundamentals?","Gary E. Dickerson","We do have products. So OLED, with the current displays, the TAM opportunity for us goes up by about a factor of 2. And -- so that's a very good opportunity for us with existing technologies. We also have some new technologies that we are seeing traction with some of these flexible products that are being -- the early ones that are being adopted by customers. And we have opportunities there with new business. We're seeing the early indications of that, but we definitely do have opportunities there also.","Robert J. Halliday","I think, Gary, now when it also grows our addressable market [indiscernible].","Gary E. Dickerson","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe first question, in terms of the share gains you guys have generated over the past year or so, as we look at 2014 versus 2015, as FinFET and 3D NAND ramp even higher next year, how much of the share gains will we, I guess, see realized in 2015, given that, Bob, I think you mentioned some of the new products that are out there? How much more will we see that impact hit the company's, I guess, top and bottom line in 2015?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, we think a few things play for us in 2015, Patrick. One, we think we could gain share. The addressable market for those products was growing fast, and we think we'll gain share. And those markets tend to be around CVD. Etch, we think, will do well. Some CMP steps are being added, I believe, in one of those structures. So it looks pretty good for us. The second thing, so mix of customer spending should play for us for those things, number one. Number two, some of our tools that we're offering in there will play for us. And then, three, within the mix of that customer spending, it's more -- first point of mix was between customer. Second was in the type of products they're buying. 3D NAND and FinFET is more heavily weighted than where we're gaining share. So I think all of those will play first usefully [ph] on the market share opportunities in [indiscernible].","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And maybe a specific question for you, Bob. Looking at the last several quarters, you guys have done a really good job in terms of, it looks like inventory, as well as DSOs and the supply chain. If you could give some of the examples of what you've done on those fronts to improve the balance sheet metrics, as well as cash flow generation.","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, some of the stuff isn't glamorous. I think the whole company's done a good job. I mean, if you think of some of the stuff we pulled onetime today, whether it's the display tools we [indiscernible] the money on, the inventory we pulled in solar, EES, the -- some of the stuff in the customs audit in Korea, there's just a lot of good blocking and tackling across a wide range of people in the company, and it feels like it's building momentum. That's a good thing. In terms of higher-level principles, we are taking more strategic view of the supply chain, I think, in terms of the ramp, IP, costs and sourcing opportunities. I think we're starting to subsegment our supply base into people who have high IP versus low-cost opportunity. I think we're tackling that a little bit [indiscernible]. I think if you look at our new products, as we're going to ship new products, we're taking a deeper view of the IP opportunities in those new products. We have sustainable differentiation ourselves. And then we'll probably take a more strategic view of it. That's still developing. We get better and better. In terms of the balance sheet, [indiscernible]. I think we're doing better. I think it's a big [indiscernible] opportunity, to be honest. But I think inventory, how we manage inventory in the factory and service, we made some progress. I think we're going to continue to make [indiscernible].","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the flat panel display again. You had pretty high level of orders. I think you have to go back to 2008 to get to those levels. And historically, those have been very lumpy. Can you give us a sense of what the yearly run rate are you thinking right now, this year and next year, in 600 to 700 kind of range? Or some help on that will be very good.","Gary E. Dickerson","What we talked about in our financial model was to get to $1 billion run rate in the 2016 model. And we feel really good about the progress we're making. We also talked about, as these new technologies are introduced, the LTPS, metal oxide, organic LED, some of these flexible substrates, all of those are great for us from a TAM growth perspective. In some cases, as much as 2x larger TAM versus where we're at today. So the market, we have really good pull relative to the total available market. And also, our market share is growing pretty significantly in the Display business. So we're very optimistic. From a model standpoint, we're still on track with what we've talked about in the 2016 model. Around $1 billion is the -- is that goal.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then one question on SSG. You talked a little bit about the memory growing 30% this year and maybe DRAM growing 5% this year. So is it fair to say that this year's growth primarily coming from memory and next year growth maybe more driven by foundry?","Gary E. Dickerson","Well, so if you look at the wafer fab equipment spending in 2014, we're still -- we still have the view that it's up 10% to 20% versus 2013. The areas that are growing are foundry, the NAND flash and also DRAM. All of those areas are up a fair amount. In the foundry case, it's more a broadening of the customers that are spending. But all of those are up a fair amount. And our current view, based on what we're hearing from customers, is that 2015 is going to be a stronger year than 2014. We see still strong spending in the foundries in 2014 and incremental improvement in the memory business. But within that, you also have, as we talked about, major technology transitions that are happening in the foundry and in NAND flash that are very positive for us.","Robert J. Halliday","So, Mahesh, we're still guessing [indiscernible]. But I guess, in my opinion, as Gary said, they're all up. Probably the biggest percentage growth of those 3 is probably NAND.","Michael Sullivan","All right, Mahesh, thanks for your question. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. In a moment, we'll discuss the results for our first quarter which ended on January 31. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements including Applied's current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions, profitability and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, and are not guarantees of future performance.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor's page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mike and good afternoon everyone. I'll start by commenting on Applied Materials' results and talk about our outlook and longer-term strategic goals. Then I'll share our views on the market and what this means for us in 2016. I'll conclude with my thoughts on each of our major businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our results and describe how we're optimizing the company's performance and delivering strong shareholder returns.","In both semiconductor and display, we see dramatic technology changes taking place. When we look at the advances our customers are making, materials innovation is at the heart of these changes. I believe this creates great opportunities for us. We have the broadest and deepest talent and technology to enable the materials innovation, that will drive the semiconductor and display industries forward.","Our strategy is to develop highly-differentiated materials engineering products and services that make major technology inflections possible. Our strategy is working and I'm pleased with our progress. We are turning the investments we've made in new products into profitable growth.","When I look at our Q1 results and our outlook for 2016, there are four main drivers of our performance. First, our leadership businesses including Epi, PVD, Implant, CMP and RTP, have high market share and unique capabilities. I see these businesses delivering critical enabling technology that our customers need to drive significant innovations in transistor and interconnect for 10-nanometer devices.","Second, our high-growth businesses, Etch and CVD, are winning substantial market share as the 3D NAND inflection and materials-enabled scaling accelerates. Third, we are delivering sustainable growth in service. 2015 was a record year for service revenue and in Q1 we booked our highest orders ever.","And finally, we are growing beyond semiconductor, specifically in display. When I meet with leading display companies, it is clear that the industry is becoming highly dependent on materials innovation, especially as they introduce new technologies like OLED. This plays to our strengths and significantly expands our market.","Now, let's turn to our market outlook. Like everyone, I'm mindful of the current global economic risks. Even in this environment, we believe 2016 wafer fab equipment spending levels will be similar to 2015. We are seeing industry investment focused on technology inflections, including 10-nanometer and 3D NAND, as well as increased spending in China. For our customers, the inflection-driven investments in foundry, logic and memory, are highly strategic. We have been witnessing a fierce battle for leadership in these new device technologies.","When I talk to customers about their major competitive challenges, they talk about how critical it is to hit the right timing for major technology transitions. In foundry, we believe 2016 investment levels will be more or less the same as last year. We anticipate that the majority of spending will be for the 10-nanometer node, which will be heavily weighted towards the second half of the calendar year. In addition, we see a broadening of foundry spending and some shifts in customer mix, shifts that I believe are very favorable to us.","In memory, we see NAND investment up about 25% year-on-year as more customers ramp 3D NAND technology. Our available market at a 3D NAND factory is up to three times greater compared to traditional planar technology.","2015 was a year of heavy DRAM investment, with the highest level of spending in five years. This year we expect DRAM investment to be down around 20% coming off this high. And in logic, we expect investment to be relatively flat year-on-year. Within the global environment, I look at China as a very significant opportunity. In China, we are seeing growth in revenue and orders, both from Chinese manufacturers as well as multinational customers who are expanding their footprints. I believe that Applied is very well positioned. We were the first company in our industry to establish a presence in China more than 30 years ago. Today, we have strong customer relationships and great talent to support the new projects that are ramping there.","Now that I've given you this background on the market environment, I would like to talk about the progress and priorities for each of our major businesses. In semiconductor equipment, I'm pleased with our momentum. Technology changes are moving the market to our sweet spot in materials engineering. And this means that our served market is now 60% of total wafer fab equipment.","We are investing more than ever in innovation and unique products to accelerate materials-enabled scaling for our customers. I like how our future pipeline is shaping up. And we have very strong pull for our latest technology. We are projecting that 40% of our 2016 revenue will come from products that we launched in the last three years.","In 2015, we believe that we made solid share gains in wafer fab equipment, with almost all our major businesses growing or maintaining their market position. I expect that 2016 will be an even stronger year for us.","In service, we aligned our strategy to enable customer success. We've done this by bringing together capabilities from across the company to deliver more value with our service products. The changes we've made to our strategy drove record performance in 2015, and we are now focusing on sustaining growth in this business.","Because demand for service is seasonal in nature, we believe year-on-year comparisons are helpful. Our Q1 revenues are up 7% compared with the same period last year. I also look at service contracts as another leading indicator of our future growth. If we look back to 2012 and 2013, the net number of tools under contract was not growing. In 2015 we added around 1,250 tools under contract, and I expect us to continue this momentum.","As I mentioned, in display, customers are also making strategic investments in new technology. We are seeing these investments accelerate, particularly for OLED displays. The display technology inflections significantly expand our available markets. For example, we project that our opportunity at an OLED factory is more than three times larger than at a traditional amorphous silicon LCD factory.","We have great opportunities and momentum in display, and I'm excited about how we are positioned. Our display business has grown consistently for the past three years, and we expect to deliver additional growth in 2016 and beyond.","To summarize, as I look ahead, I am confident about our future growth and performance. We are maintaining a positive outlook for Applied in 2016 because our customers are making strategic inflection-driven investments that play to our strengths.","Our leadership businesses, where we have unique capabilities, are performing well as the market comes to the sweet spot of our technology. Our high-growth businesses, Etch and CVD, are making significant market share gains as the 3D NAND inflection accelerates. And we are delivering sustainable growth in service and display. Across the organization, we are focused on delivering enabling products and services and generating attractive returns for our shareholders.","Now, let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our quarterly results, performance, and priorities. Bob?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Gary.","Like Gary, I believe we're in a strong position to deliver profitable growth in 2016, as our customers invest in the technology roadmaps across semi and display. Based on the demand outlooks of our customers, I believe we'll make significant progress this year towards our 2018 financial model, and we will deliver very attractive cash returns to our shareholders.","On the revenue line, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making in semiconductor systems market share. While we expect the WFE market to be about the same size this calendar year, we believe our share of WFE will be higher. We expect our SAM share of WFE to expand this year as well. In fact, we believe it will be up seven points compared to 2012.","Our Global Services business is on track for a third consecutive year of growth, and we believe our display business will grow for a fourth consecutive year. I'm also encouraged by the progress our teams are making on our gross margin initiatives, and I am still confident that we'll make additional progress in our second half.","On the operating expense line, we are tightly controlling our discretionary spending, holding OpEx relatively flat while strengthening R&D. We are making substantial R&D investments to deliver a strong pipeline of new products for emerging inflections. These products are already delivering revenue growth today. At the same time, we're reducing non-GAAP G&A to the lowest level in years. We've made further progress with our tax structure, and I believe we're on track to lower the rate once again this year.","We continue to be aggressive with the buyback program. We've repurchased 112 million shares over the past three quarters, which is equal to 9% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the program. So while 2016 is shaping up to be a flattish year for WFE, we believe Applied will outperform our markets, making significant progress towards our financial 2018 model and deliver very attractive cash returns for our shareholders.","Next, I'll make a few comments about the first quarter. When we delivered financial results that were slightly better than our expectations. Revenue of $2.3 billion declined 5% sequentially, and we slightly increased our non-GAAP gross margin to 42.4%. We held non-GAAP operating expenses within the range, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.26, slightly above the midpoint of the range.","Turning to the balance sheet, we used $625 million to repurchase 35 million shares of our stock. We've completed 65% of the $3 billion authorization, and we'll continue to be opportunistic with the program. We also repaid $800 million in short-term debt and redeemed a $400 million bond scheduled to mature in June.","Turning to the segments, Silicon Systems orders were 12% lower sequentially. Within the mix, only DRAM orders were higher. Our Silicon backlog remained healthy at $1.6 billion, and while revenue declined in Q1, we believe our demand will increase in Q2 and the second half. Our AGS orders reached $773 million and set another all-time quarterly record. AGS sequential revenue was slightly lower, consistent with seasonal patterns.","Our display orders were down 6% sequentially, but remained up year-over-year. Our display revenue increased 12% sequentially. Bear in mind that display orders and revenue will continue to be lumpy. EES turned to modest profit even as revenue remained at low levels.","Now, I'll provide our business outlook for Q2. We believe our overall net sales will be up by 5% to 10% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect Silicon Systems' net sales will be up by 11% to 17%; AGS net sales should be flat to up 5%. We expect our display net sales to be down by 20% to 30%, and EES net sales should be approximately $55 million.","Our non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately flat, and we plan to hold non-GAAP operating expenses in a range of $565 million, plus or minus $10 million. We are forecasting a Q2 non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, and we believe non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.30 to $0.34.","So in summary, we see 2016 as a year when a broad range of our customers invest in leading-edge technology across semi and display. Our investments have put us in a position to grow our served market, revenue, share and earnings. While we're mindful of the macroeconomic concerns, we believe 2016 will be a strong year for Applied Materials.","Now, let me turn the call over to Mike for questions.","Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Operator, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on the silicon side. So, given your outlook for you guys to outgrow WFE and where you are in terms of backlog and the orders in the quarter, the math seems to work that orders should be up at least 20%, 25% into the April quarter and then rising through the back-half of the year. Is that kind of the framework you're looking for? And I guess within that, how should we be thinking about mix between foundry, logic, memory through the year?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, C.J., I'll take a shot at that. We're not going to give specific orders guidance, but we have said, we do believe that the second half is stronger than the first half. We do believe that the first half is a little bit more weighted to NAND, whereas the second half is more weighted to stronger performance in foundry, logic and DRAM. So we do see a stronger second half. And incrementally, we see strong performance for Applied in the second half, because of our position on V-NAND throughout the year and also foundry and the 10-nanometer conversion. So we think the second half does feel more positive than the first half, and our position is pretty good in the second half.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Excellent. And I guess as follow-up, how should we think about the trajectory here off of a flat gross margin guide into the back-half of the year?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. We said on the last call that first half of fiscal 2016 would be flattish with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 when we did 42.2%. We did 42.4% in first quarter this year. We're guiding to about the same in Q2. So we're a little above what we thought we were a quarter ago and we still believe that the second half is up from the first half. We've said in the last call there to be a 200 basis point roughly increase from first half to second half. We think the full year is still positive as we've said. We think we exit the year. We think we're up in the second half. But given that we're a little ahead of plan in the first half, I don't know if there's a 200 basis point improvement from first half to second half.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Got you. Makes sense. Thanks so much.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, C.J.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.","Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on a solid quarter and a strong guide. I have two questions as well. The first one is regarding memory CapEx. Just given the recent pricing dynamics in memory, are you worried at all about DRAM and NAND CapEx in the back-half of the year? Or do you think the pending projects are strategic enough for your customers to spend according to plan?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, generally, we think that this year is sort of flattish with last year, when last year it was 31.5% to 32%. But the year is a good year for Applied Materials, because if you look at the spending this year, we kind of think foundry, logic are flattish, but the mix within foundry and logic spending in terms of what they're buying, I mean customer profile is very good for Applied.","The second thing is within memory, DRAM is down about 20% and we think flash is up about 25%. And the predominant spending in flash is V-NAND. So that transition on V-NAND is particular good for Applied on three levels. One, the absolute level of greenfield spending for first and second generation V-NAND is higher than the absolute spending for planar NAND. The second thing is that the reuse \u2013 where they were doing a lot of reuse in the shrink on planar, is significantly less in first and second generation V-NAND, and particularly around tools that we sell. And thirdly, we're gaining on the transition.","So I think that the mix within the year plays for Applied, and in terms of our concern, we think the 31.5% type number, maybe a little more on the year is a fair estimate, and we think we've taken the risk you've referenced into account.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.","Okay, helpful. Thank you. The second one is regarding your display business. I know, Gary and Bob, you've both touched on this, but can you maybe talk little bit about what you're seeing in terms of orders trends primarily in China today and how big the OLED opportunity could be for you guys in 2017 and beyond, I'm guessing primarily in Korea?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. The OLED is a great opportunity for Applied. We've talked about the increase in the total available markets there added CVD, PVD, thin film encapsulation steps. So if you do a comparison to amorphous silicon LCD, the total available market is up by about a factor of three for us. In display, we've talked about 2016, we're anticipating it being a fourth consecutive year of growth. And based on everything we're seeing, we're on track to either hit or exceed the 2018 model that we published for display previously.","So display, we have tremendous momentum. And certainly OLED, especially in mobile, is a huge opportunity for us. The other thing I would say is that this is really a great proof of our ability to expand materials engineering into adjacent markets.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the lumpiness in some of the order patterns, particularly NAND, I mean for NAND to be as strong as you've talked about it. It seems like it's going to come back a lot in the second quarter, is that the right trajectory? And then longer-term, how long do you think this 3D investment sustains, and when do you think that that might peak?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. I'll take a shot at that. The \u2013 so if you look at it, the disconnect is, we think that NAND is stronger in the second half than the first half and we think there's an increase in traction around V-NAND \u2013 I'm sorry NAND is stronger in the first half than the second half. And you'd say, well, why did you have bigger DRAM orders and not NAND? We had already booked some. If you go look back to Q3, Q4, of 2015, we had very large bookings, and some of those were V-NAND bookings.","Secondly, we see increasing traction. So if you see why we're beating in Q2, it's around two things in particular. It's around China and a wider proliferation of V-NAND. So we do see the momentum on V-NAND and we're pretty comfortable that it's going to happen.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then in terms of the length, the duration of this investment?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Oh, the duration.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Does it grow again you think in 2017? Do you have the visibility to say that?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So right now, there's about 1.4 million wafer starts in the world of NAND. Through the end of calendar 2015, 150,000 had been converted. We think cumulatively through the end of 2016 there's going be 350,000 to 400,000. So through the end of 2016, 400,000 of 1.4 million available have been converted. We think most of those get converted over time. This year, we think NAND spending is about $8.7 million. And we think it's sustained to pretty good levels over the next three years for this conversion. Does it stay that high? I'm not sure, but it's a pretty healthy number.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful, thank you very much.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. Actually I had two. First, Bob, if I look at the service, orders have been pretty meaningfully above revenue for about a year now. And I thought that service usually had like a one-year contract. So I guess I would have thought that we would see some catch-up on revenue relative to bookings. So are these contracts now lengthening out beyond a year? Can you sort of bridge that gap for us? Thanks.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The service contracts are a good leading indicator of revenue and they are also a good leading indicator of sustainability of revenue, because you build in that relationship over time, and customers get greater value from us, frankly. And so, it's a win-win both ways.","In terms of how you recognize it through the revenue plan, it is happening. A couple of things are happening though in the quarter. One, you did have the Chinese New Year and a little bit of slowdown started up earlier in Q1. So we book a lot of contracts typically in Q1, but the revenues \u2013 it's not a high revenue quarter, and fab utilization was okay in the quarter, so in terms of tactical sales of spares and services, not super high. And then 200-millimeter tools are in that number too, and those go up and down a little bit.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, Bob. And, Gary, just a question for you on M&A. Can you just talk at a very, very high level about that? There's just not a lot of stuff in your current SAM that really can move the needle for you. So I guess the question is your willingness to think a bit outside the box and maybe expand your SAM into some new verticals. Thanks a lot.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks for the question. Regarding our current strategy, we like our current strategy. The outlook for 2016 we think is very strong. And beyond 2016, we also believe that there are great opportunities for growth. We have a strong position in transistor and interconnect as foundry and logic moves to the new technology node, very strong pull for Etch deposition tools also, especially in the memory space, but certainly in patterning and future technology nodes. We're growing service, growing the display business, and we believe that's sustainable growth in those markets.","So overall, we're making tremendous progress towards the 2018 model, and we're optimistic about growth opportunities for Applied, especially when you look at what's driving this year and what's going to drive the future. You have 10-nanometer that is really based on materials \u2013 new materials, 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, new memory technologies, organic LED displays. All of those areas are enabled by materials innovation where Applied has clear leadership. And we think this is a -we're in the early innings of these changes and in driving materials-enabled scaling. So I am personally very optimistic about growth for Applied Materials.","Relative to M&A, our strategy continues to be pretty much the same. We continue to look for good opportunities, but we're very selective in what we look at. There are three criteria: financial returns; strategic alignment, especially with our materials engineering technology; and does the company have an opportunity for leadership in whatever segments that they're in. So those are three things we look at. Certainly we keep looking for opportunities, but I am very confident about our growth opportunities, and we are definitely not needy relative to M&A.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot for that, Gary. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you. You talked about strength in China, and I'm seeing orders in this region up 20% sequentially and up over 50% year over year, and in terms of regions, your second-largest region for total orders. Can you guys talk a little bit about what's driving that strength and the sustainability of it?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I can start and then, Bob, if you want to add anything. So clearly there's a lot of activity in China. We see investments by both multinational companies and domestic companies. Applied has a very strong position in China. We were the first company to build capability there about 30 years ago; very strong team, very strong capability, very good relationships and positions with both the Chinese companies and the multinational companies that are moving to China. So we would look at this as certainly an incrementally very good opportunity in 2016. But my feeling is that this is certainly not just a 2016 story; that there's a great opportunity going forward, and for Applied we're very, very well positioned.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Thanks, Gary. And then I also had a question on OLED. So your display business is about $700 million to $800 million last year. Can you break down for us within that, how much is OLED revenue? And when do you think this business actually starts to move the needle for total revenues?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, we segment it in a couple of ways. One, we talk about historically between TVs and smaller screens, and the smaller screens historically have been split between OLED and non-OLED. Last year, mostly what we've sold was OLED. It was the encapsulation tools. Those were OLED-like. We talked about bookings last year of $150 million. Many people in the mainstream media speculate that there will be a more rapid transition, particularly in the small screens, to OLED. We are pretty well positioned for that.","In terms of split of revenues, we said earlier in the year that our split of revenues that we were projecting for this year between small screens and larger screens, TVs and smaller screens, I think we were like 60% for the small mobile devices and about 40% for the others, mostly TVs. If anything, we think we're better positioned if there's an inflection that goes more strong in OLED. So over time we think there's probably more and more of that.","Now put in perspective, we are much better positioned than we were several years ago there in terms of products and breadth of products. And there are about twice as many layers on OLED devices and LED screens. So I think we're very well positioned. The inflection seems to be happening, but we haven't talked specific numbers. And it won't hit our revenue line right away because these tools take about nine months to build.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question, I had two of them. First one, for Gary or Bob, looks like everyone is bullish on 3D NAND, which kind of makes sense given the technology transition going on. I'm curious. When you guys look at the risks to it, where do you think we could be wrong in terms of the 3D NAND growth? And along with that, have any of your customers actually looking at 2D NAND at like 12-nanometer or below, or do you think there's no more 2D NAND development being done? And then I had a follow-up.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think relative to 3D NAND, certainly when I'm spending time with customers, there's a tremendous competitive pressure to move to 3D NAND technology. So all the discussions \u2013 and I had met with many customers over the last few weeks, so all of the discussions were focused on that transition. Not everybody is in the same place relative to the maturity or the yield for that technology, but I certainly see that as an overwhelming focus for all of the memory companies.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Got it, and then a follow-up on the display side. It looks like when you compare to your semi business, your served available market on display is pretty low. I understand that you're riding the OLED wave. Is there any plan to actually make the display like a $2 billion revenue business by organically or inorganically developing products so that you can get a better percentage of the display CapEx?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We've got, as we've talked about, really good momentum in OLED with 3x larger TAM than we've had in the past. Bob talked about the number of steps increasing with CVD, PVD. We've entered thin film encapsulation also, so that gives us another growth driver. So we're very optimistic in terms of the growth opportunities in display. We are working on some other areas that would expand our TAM, but we're not ready to talk about those.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thank you.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Krish.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the solid results and guide. My first question is on 3D NAND. In your guidance of up 25%, can you tell us if you are including XPoint or any of the new memories in there? And secondly, if you could tell us what portion of the non-CapEx was 3D last year and how much of it is on 3D this year?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So I can take on the XPoint. XPoint still is really in the early phases. So really almost no CapEx for XPoint in our forecast. And what was the other question?","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","The other question was what portion of the CapEx within NAND is 3D in 2016 and what portion of it was 3D in 2015?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We think that in 2015, it was a little under 50% and we think in 2016 it's probably mid-80%s.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And then one question on China. I wanted to just probe little bit more along China. There are two things we are seeing from China, one is, like, we have seen new fab announcements from new entrants. So I wanted to understand if you have seen any of the orders or any activity from new companies that are coming up in China like XMC or some of the other memory companies that have been announced?","And secondly, there have also been some large equity investments in some of the tech companies in U.S. from Chinese private equity companies, and I wanted to hear if you have received any interest from any private equity firm in China?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, the first question, have we seen memory orders from new Chinese manufacturers in China, Farhan?","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Memory or interest, like even activity, like, joint development projects or R&D lines or any sort of activity?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Let me try to answer and help. Most of the activity we're seeing tactically is from existing customers; existing customers in China already and existing customers outside of China who are increasing their footprint in China. We hear about people interested in technology and in acquisitions, but we're not really involved in that.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say we are engaged with some of these companies, but relative to business coming from those companies right now, it's very minimal. We are engaged with some companies that have future opportunities, but by far and away, the majority of the business today is from existing companies.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. That's all I have.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Farhan.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Nice job on the quarterly execution and the strong guide. On the foundry investment for this year, I think you guys were previously looking for a slight growth for foundry this year and now you're kind of guiding for flattish. I'm just kind of curious what's changed. Do you see a slower 10-nanometer conversion cycle? Or maybe slightly lower 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer capacity adds? Any color here would be appreciated.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't think we've changed much, frankly. I think we were flattish, slightly up last time. We're flattish now. I don't think there's been much change, frankly. I wouldn't read too much into it.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There has been some change in mix.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think mix has changed a little bit. In other words, we think some of our foundry customers are more committed to their spending, giving us orders. Some of the others seem to be hesitating. So we think the mix has changed a little bit from last quarter.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And those changes are also a positive for us in 2016.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, okay. And then on DRAM, you expect it to be more second-half weighted. Are you starting to see the 1X nanometer DRAM conversion in your pipeline for the second half of this year? And is this part of what's driving the second half bias?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We see some of that happening this year, but we're not getting a lot of orders yet.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But it is a big focus, there's no question. 1X is also another one of these competitive battlegrounds where there's a lot of focus.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks a lot.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Harlan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, Gary and Bob, nice execution, just a follow-up question on China. So can you share your thoughts on the competitive landscape in semi-cap equipment from local Chinese semi-cap suppliers? I mean Applied has been there for many years. Do you see any meaningful local Chinese semi-cap competitors different from other regions in the world?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As you've said, we've been there for a long time. We have extremely strong relationships. I mean certainly you have some investment from multinationals moving to China. And the transitions that are happening there are areas where we have strong shares, strong momentum. And the domestic companies that are there, we also have a very strong share position. Historically, those positions have been some of the best that we have within the company and that really \u2013 we expect to continue that outlook in 2016.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks, Gary. And then just a follow-up question for Bob on how to think about modeling gross margin in the second half of this year. It sounds like foundry customer mix, it's helping Applied's revenue in the second half of the year. But should we also think about that helping drive gross margin higher in the second half too, because of the favorable foundry customer mix? Thanks.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It should help some. If you go look at why it would be up from the first half through to second half, it would be because some of foundry mix \u2013 some cost reduction is helping us and some is maturing of new tools. The thing that helps us a little bit ahead of schedule in the first half is we had some pull-in a little bit of some of the foundry customers that we have. And this is some of the lagging node stuff as much as anything, where we have strong share and positions. So foundry does help us generally, because the mix of tools is more advantageous for us there.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks, Bob.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much, and congrats on a nice year. Bob, first on the display side. Typically, it's always had little bit of a lower gross margins relative to your Silicon system. As this transition to OLED begins, is there any potential, I guess, margin improvement you see with the product portfolio and things that you have done on display side of things?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think display gross margins will improve over time. I think that in this year of early adoption of some of these new tools, I think they're okay. And then they get better through the end of the year into next year. The second thing that we talked about I think on the earlier calls is that the mix of tools we sell into small screens versus TVs. TVs is a sweet spot for us in terms of mix of tools and gross margins. It's a little bit different mix down at the smaller screen side with little lower gross margins. And as we mature our positions there, they should get pretty good. So by the time we're done, you'll see gross margins more attractive in display over the next year or two.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And Gary, maybe a question on a bigger picture related to EUV and potential capital intensity increases on future technology nodes on the logic end. Have you had any customer discussions that have highlighted, hey, EUV could be further delayed? What are you guys going to do to help us out? And maybe potentially, especially since your models are based on EUV getting the 7-nanometer logic node, maybe just on a big picture basis, what are some of the, I guess, additional incremental opportunities for Applied if EUV misses this next node?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks for the question, Patrick. We have a number of very deep engagements with customers in patterning. Certainly patterning cost is one area that's a big focus, but also from a yield standpoint, edge placement errors are another area that is a big focus for our customers. And this is another area where, again, materials innovation, materials engineering, there are some really great opportunities for us. So as we continue to drive new capabilities with the new products that we've introduced over the last three years, the combinations of those products we also see tremendous opportunity. So the engagements that we have with customers I would say are further out, broader, deeper than we've ever had. And this particular area is one that is a huge focus for all of our customers.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter end guide. My question is on the foundry side. With improved visibility of your 10-nanometer orders, do you think 10-nanometer will be a smaller node similar to 20-nanometer, or is it closer to through node? And related to that, how much of 10-nanometer capacity do you expect by the end of this calendar year? And lastly on this topic, what's the incremental equipment for 2016, 14-nanometer versus 10-nanometer and maybe between 10-nanometer versus 7-nanometer? If you can give some color, it would be great.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, let me see if I can do this efficiently. Our customers tend to think of these as sister nodes now, 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, and then 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer. They do the interconnect stuff more on the first leg and they do the transistor stuff more on the second leg. So they tend to ramp quickly through the first leg, whether it be 20-nanometer or 10-nanometer, to get to 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, or 7-nanometer.","And so my guess, 10-nanometer won't be a long node. They're already going to start doing parallel work on the 7-nanometer, and so it won't be a long node. The total node of 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, the sister might be an attractive node, but they've got to get to 7-nanometer. Okay, that's one and two.","In terms of comparing 20-nanometer\/16-nanometer\/14-nanometer to 10-nanometer\/7-nanometer, there are differences. You have to look at what the backfill is from the previous node on a lot of this stuff. So if you look at 20-nanometer, they change the interconnect, but it was the last planar transistor, it wasn't a FinFET. So the attractiveness in terms of processing power and battery, processing speed and battery is a lot better on a FinFET. So that you didn't have a lot of people pull to go to 20-nanometer, they waited for 16-nanometer. You don't have that disadvantage when you're going from 16-nanometer to 10-nanometer. So there will be a lot of tapeouts still coming at 16-nanometer from people who went from 28-nanometer and so forth. So you're not going have back this back-filled gap you had at 20-nanometer.","So point number one, 10-nanometer\/7-nanometer are probably attractive. They get through 10-nanometer pretty aggressively. You won't have as big a gap as you've had at 20-nanometer because 16-nanometer will backfill and tapeouts will increase.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Switching to a different subject, how should we think about your buybacks in your April quarter now that your thinking is down to roughly $1 billion remaining authorization? And are you restricted somehow by domestic cash balance to do more buybacks beyond the existing program?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, the total authorized buyback was $3 billion. Through the end of fiscal Q1, we've done $1.950 billion, so we have $1.050 billion left under the existing authorization. The way we execute the authorization is we look at multiple valuation metrics of the company and we set up a table, such that if the stock price is attractive based on, frankly, longer-term metrics, then we will buy stock. So we pretty aggressively bought stock the last three quarters.","We started to get a little bit tight on U.S.-sourced cash in September. So what we did was we were able to trigger home some $800 million of cash as a repatriation of capital without paying tax. And secondly, we raised some money through debt. So right now, about 50% of our cash is onshore at the end of the fiscal quarter. So we think we have enough cash to execute the buyback. And then if we want to continue \u2013 we are committed to long-term cash returns to shareholders through dividends and buyback. If we want to continue to buy back after discussion with the board, we believe we can find other sources of cash.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Pacific Crest. Your line is open.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi, thanks. I just have a couple of questions. First, operating expenses, they look like they're creeping up a little based on the guidance. I'm just wondering if you think that flattens out moving forward or if that grows a bit more in the second half.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We said we're about $5 million over in Q1, about $5 million over the midpoint in Q2. So I think we're a $5 million over model for a quarter or two. But I think we're pretty much holding the line.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Did you say $5.55 million or $5.65 million for Q2?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We're flat from Q2 forward.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. The other question is just related to the Inspection segment. You have the new E-Beam tool, a new optical tool. KLA had a pretty good quarter and outlook. They had orders up 26% last quarter and they have a new inspection platform launching this year. You said you'll get more aggressive in that segment. So I'm just wondering if you can walk us through what you think happens in the Inspection segment. Do you think you can gain some share or grow your SAM this year, or is it more of a 2017 event?","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're pretty optimistic on wafer inspection and review for 2016. Our UVision brightfield tool has a good position in foundry and logic. Last quarter we talked about receiving our first revenue for our new E-Beam inspection platform in both memory and foundry. E-Beam technology is the largest part of PDC revenue, our PDC division. We're number one in E-Beam review, and now taking that technology into Inspection, where we have significant pull from customers. So overall in 2016, we're pretty optimistic about that business.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, good. Thank you.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Wes. And, operator, I think we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yes. Good afternoon. So a quick question on the mature side of the business. What is your view right now for 200-millimeter business this year? And what impact does that have on margins in general?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","200-millimeter business ticked up last year. 200-millimeter business is driven mostly for things like sensors, CIS devices. There's a growing content of those in your mobile devices and also in things like automobiles. Last year it spiked up as they added capacity. We think sales of 200-millimeter tools this year might be down a little bit, but healthy.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then over the next two years, do you think that's still an IoT growth market for you?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Generally speaking, we're positive on IoT growth in sensors and things like that. How it translates into used 200-millimeter tools sales, we're not sure past this year.","Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say that those \u2013 the other wafer processing CIS, CMOS image sensors, power devices, RF sensors, all of those areas are definitely areas of growth. And some we're seeing in China with some of the business incrementally in 2016, but definitely that will continue to grow. Whether it's 200-millimeter or 300-millimeter, I think that it may not be 200-millimeter far into the future, but certainly that is definitely an area of growth and opportunity for Applied.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mark Heller from CLSA. Your line is open.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in. Two questions on OLED. I guess first, along with the display business you're guiding down I think 20% to 30% on revenues for the April quarter. I was wondering if you could give any color on the expectations for display orders in the April quarter.","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Again, these tools take nine months to build, Mark. So I wouldn't read too much into the Q2. I think that the general direction is positive and our position is positive on display. So I think I wouldn't read too much into Q2, that's more of a result of what we booked six months to nine months ago.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. But any color on direction of orders for the April quarter for display?","Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We don't usually guide explicit orders, but we're directionally positive.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then it sounds like most of the interest or activity is on small-screen displays. But I was wondering if you have any thoughts on OLED TV pickup and investment there?","Gary E.

Applied invites you to attend our 2012 Investors and Analyst Meeting in New York City on Wednesday, March 28. At the event, you'll have a chance to meet the executive team, get an update on all of our businesses and take a deep look into emerging technologies during our afternoon breakout sessions. The registration site is open now and we hope to see many of you in 6 weeks.","And with that introduction, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter.","Michael R. Splinter","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. On behalf of Applied Materials, I would like to convey our condolences to Steve Appleton's family and our colleagues at Micron. Steve's leadership in the semiconductor industry will be greatly missed.","Now let me comment on Applied Materials' performance and our industry outlook. I'm pleased to report that Applied started 2012 with a strong first quarter, posting revenue and earnings that exceeded the high-end of our ranges. Global demand for mobile electronics is driving strong capital investments by semiconductor customers, resulting in solid order momentum and higher expectations for our second quarter. The rate of technical change continues to accelerate in all of our markets and leading-edge technology investment remains a priority for our customers.","In early November, we completed our acquisition of Varian, and welcomed their talented team into the Applied Materials family. Bringing these 2 leaders together comes at a critical time as the industry accelerates its advanced transistor roadmap. Our combined capabilities in Epi implant and thermal processing enabled new opportunities to provide customers with high-value solutions for the next generations of high performance energy-efficient transistors.","Let me now turn to the economic outlook. Since the start of the year, we have seen improvements in a number of macroeconomic indicators. While the ongoing recession and increased austerity in parts of Europe remain a concern, we believe the global economic environment will support healthy spending by consumers and businesses.","I'll now provide an update for each of our segments. In semiconductor, 2012 is shaping up to be the year of the foundry. The mobility trend is driving growth and in the fourth calendar quarter, smartphone unit sales surpassed PCs for the first time. We expect between 600 million and 700 million smartphones to be sold in 2012, an increase of 35% year-on-year. In addition, we believe the tablet market will grow by more than 60% this year on top of 65 million units sold in 2011.","Smartphones and tablets are driving demand for application processors and as these processors become increasingly sophisticated, we are seeing a significant increase in die sizes. As a result, foundries are aggressively investing as they ramp production at the 3x and 2x nodes.","Applied is favorably exposed to foundry investment. In our first quarter, we saw 75% increase in revenue from these customers and expect sequential growth of over 40% in our second quarter, driven by record quarterly sales in our front-end products, metal deposition products and implant.","Mobile devices are also driving NAND bit growth rate, which is expected to exceed 70% this year. As a result, NAND manufacturers are investing in new capacity and moving to the 2x and 1x nodes. We believe PCs will be the primary beneficiary of improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The new ultrabook categories in Windows 8 have the potential to drive a PC refresh cycle and spur growth in the second half of the year.","Oversupply in DRAM continues, with manufacturers able to meet the 30% to 40% bit growth that is expected in 2012 by migrating existing lines to advanced nodes. As a result, we expect another year of low-DRAM investment, although we do expect spending to be modestly higher in the second half.","Wafer fab equipment spending for 2011 exceeded our forecast ending the year at approximately $35 billion. Lithography investment reached record highs last year, as memory makers implemented device shrinks by upgrading lines with immersion systems.","As we look at 2012, we expect another solid year for capital equipment spending and currently estimate wafer fab equipment will be in the range of $30 billion to $35 billion or flat to down 15%. 2011 was a strong year for our inspection, transistor, deposition and electroplating businesses, and we expect to see share gains in all of these areas. However, 2011 was a down year for our share in etch and CMP, primarily due to spending mix.","Over the past 4 quarters, we have increased the number of tools under service contracts in Asia by over 20%, and as we progress with the Varian integration, we see opportunities to expand our implant-related services in the region.","During the quarter, we launched 2 new CVD applications on the producer platform, enabling enhanced device performance for our customers and adding to our served market. We also released the fifth generation of SEMVision, our industry-leading defect review system. As the industry\u2019s 450-millimeter roadmap becomes clearer, we continue to work closely with our customers and focus on developing early test wafer systems.","In Display, the low absolute level of orders show that we are continuing a long bottom of the current down cycle. TV unit shipments grew modestly in 2011, and holiday sales were encouraging, helping to reduce inventories and close the gap between capacity and demand. However, we do not anticipate significant new investments in television-related capacity until late in 2012.","In order to reduce our breakeven point, we've implemented a range of spending controls while continuing to invest in targeted product development. Our customers are starting to transition new technologies into volume production, specifically metal oxide transistors and low-temperature polysilicon for OLED and high-resolution LCDs. We expect these next-generation factories to increase the served available market for our CVD and PVD products by over 30%.","In solar, end market demand exceeded all expectations in 2011, with installations ending the year in the 26- to 28-gigawatt range. This was driven by an acceleration of panel consumption in Europe late in the year, combined with strengthening demand in China, Japan and the United States. Germany alone installed 4 gigawatts in the last 3 months of the calendar year. We expect strong end market growth to continue and anticipate 2012 installations to be in the range of 28 to 35 gigawatts.","In 2011, we capitalized on the industry's rapid capacity expansion, gained market share and delivered strong operating performance. While the industry is currently in a period of capacity digestion, several top-tier manufacturers have been running their factories at close to full utilization. We are also seeing unnecessary rationalization of capacity, as less competitive players consolidate or exit.","Given the depth of this downturn and equipment demand, we are taking significant steps to reduce our cost structure in EES. However, we remain confident in the long-term potential of this business. Cell efficiency is becoming increasingly important for customers and as new technology is adopted, we expect to see an increase in demand for our leading-edge products as some portion of the industry's current capacity becomes obsolete.","In summary, Applied began 2012 with a strong first quarter, and we enter our second quarter with order momentum, driven by our semiconductor businesses. Visibility for the second half of the year is limited, but we're optimistic about 2012 and expect the third consecutive year of wafer fab equipment spending above $30 billion.","Now let me hand the call over to George for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?","George S. Davis","Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining us on the call today.","For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Applied delivered revenue of $2.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.18, both above the high-end of our outlook, led by strong net sales in our Silicon Systems business. The results included Varian's financial for the fourth quarter, which contributed net sales of $202 million and approximately $0.013 in non-GAAP earnings per share.","Applied's orders in the first quarter increased by 26% to $2 billion, as an increase in SSG orders offset softness in AGS and a weak environment for EES and Display. Our backlog decreased by 10% to $2.2 billion. The decrease reflected a 0.92 book-to-bill ratio and negative backlog adjustments of $146 million, partially offset by $94 million in Varian backlog acquired. The negative items consisted of $99 million in financial debookings with the balance from cancellations and foreign exchange effects. Financial debookings are made when the expected delivery date for an existing order moves beyond our 12-month policy window. Our non-semi businesses accounted for over 75% of the negative adjustments.","Net sales were flat at $2.2 billion, exceeding the high-end of our outlook of down 5% to 15%, primarily due to SSG performance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40.7%, up 1.2 points sequentially, driven by higher mix of SSG revenue that was partially offset by a $31 million inventory adjustment in EES. Non-GAAP gross margins excluded the effects of Varian acquisition adjustments, which I will take a moment to explain.","In accordance with purchase accounting rules, Varian's balance sheet was adjusted to fair market value with inventory essentially written up to sales price. This adjustment, along with the amortization of intangibles, was reflected in cost of sales. The adjusted inventory is expected to be consumed by the end of our second fiscal quarter. Varian acquisition-related charges in Q1, including the purchase accounting adjustments, deal cost and integration costs, were $153 million, of which, $96 million were reported in cost of sales and $57 million were included in operating expenses.","We are very focused on exceeding our synergy goal of $50 million to $60 million by the end of year 2. Our efforts since the close have been productive and we believe we will exceed the high-end of our 2-year target and will reflect more than 50% of our announced savings in our fiscal year-end run rate.","Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $546 million, slightly better than the low-end of our target range due to favorable onetime items and spending controls across the company. We expect our non-GAAP OpEx in Q2 to be $565 million, plus or minus $10 million, with higher investment in Silicon Systems and lower shutdown savings, being mostly offset by lower spending in our non-semi businesses.","Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3 billion, down $4.2 billion from Q4, reflecting cash from operations offset by the Varian purchase and $304 million in cash returned to shareholders in dividends and share repurchase. ","Operating cash flows were $181 million or 8% of net sales. The cash flows reflect the impact of certain Varian closing and initial integration costs, continuing decreases in customer deposits in non-semi as we draw down deferred revenue and our annual variable compensation payout. We expect a strong recovery in cash from operations in the second quarter.","Our capital allocation priorities are to make organic and inorganic investments that provide attractive long-term returns. We are also committed to increasing the dividend, in line with the growth of the business, and to utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash after investment and debt service. Dividend payouts in the quarter were $104 million, and we used $200 million to purchase 18.3 million shares at $10.95 per share.","Next, I will comment on our operating segments. Silicon Systems Group orders were up 53% to $1.4 billion, reflecting demand from foundry and NAND customers. Net sales increased 26% to $1.3 billion, above the high end of our expectations, led by a more than 75% increase in our revenues from foundry customers and growth in memory-related sales. Customer concentration remained high with 3 customers accounting for approximately 70% of revenue. The non-GAAP operating margin increased to 28.7% and operating margin dollars grew by 36%, reflecting the addition of Varian's equipment business.","In Applied Global Services, orders were down 8% to $517 million, driven by low customer factory utilization levels. We anticipate these levels to gradually improve throughout the year. Net sales in AGS of $534 million were at the midpoint of our outlook of down 10% to 20%. As a reminder, our lower guidance anticipated the absence of $71 million in some fab revenues that were reported in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin dropped to 21.2% on lower revenue.","In Display, orders increased modestly to $40 million. Net sales were down 39% to $104 million, in line with the downturn. Tight spending controls enabled the group to achieve a non-GAAP operating margin of 7%. In EES, orders declined to $33 million and net sales declined 34% to $207 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was negative 8.2% on lower revenue and an inventory adjustment of $31 million.","We have taken several cost actions in EES to date including workforce reductions, shortened workweeks, product program rationalization and spending controls. Over the past few quarters, operating expenses have been reduced by approximately 20%, and we have removed over 50% of our manufacturing cost structure. Given the uncertain period to an uptick in demand, we are continuing to look for additional cost-saving opportunities in order to further lower breakeven levels. We'll provide an update of these actions at the Investor Analyst Meeting in March.","Now I will cover our targets for what is shaping up to be a very strong second quarter, led by our semiconductor businesses. We expect SSG net sales to be up 15% to 25% due to strong sequential growth in foundry spending. In AGS, we expect net sales to be up 5% to 10%, driven by improving customer utilization levels. In Display, we believe net sales will be in the range of flat to down 25% off a low base, as the industry continues to absorb overcapacity. In EES, we expect net sales to be down greater than 40% due to continuing soft demand and the drawdown of backlog and deferred revenue. We expect our overall net sales to be up 5% to 15%, and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.28 per share, reflecting the positive effect of higher semiconductor revenues on our margin structure.","Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks George. [Operator Instructions] Rachel, let's, please, begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Question on the equipment [ph] order momentum here, that you mentioned, Mike. The foundry and NAND orders were very strong in the first quarter. Are you managing the company to see those orders sustainable in the near-term or is there kind of a normal digestion period that you're expecting to play out?","Michael R. Splinter","Thanks, Stephen. If we really look at the first half, we think certainly with the visibility that we have so far, we think that they'll be sustainable through the first half of the year. I think the question for the second half of the year is we see that NAND spending will continue to rise in the second half of the year, and it's just a question of how much foundry will soften if it softens during that period.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And as a quick follow-up on the EES operating breakeven level, do you have an estimate, George, of where we can think about the breakeven level being for the EES division going forward?","George S. Davis","Yes. Thanks, Stephen. The breakeven level coming into the year was about $800 million. And with the actions that have been taken so far, probably see about $100 million come out of that today. And we'll -- again like I said, we'll cover at the March Investor Meeting, we'll update our progress on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess first question, relative to customer concentration, are you seeing -- what were you seeing price-wise in the industry as we see 1 or 2 guys kind of dominate a big chunk of the order book? Is anything out of the ordinary there or kind of business-as-usual?","Michael R. Splinter","Jim, we really make these agreements with customers just a couple of times a year that really frame how we're going to do business. So I don't think that there's anything that's not predicted. But I think that this is just part of the consolidation that we're seeing, and especially when you think about the trends that are happening in the industry where the smartphone supply chain kind of gets -- is also consolidated to a few players. It's not surprising that we're going to continue to see this high rate of concentration.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. And for my follow-up, I guess kind of more of the bigger picture question about the cycles and if they're changing at all, just from the standpoint of historically, when your customers [indiscernible] they probably ordered more, and when they weren't doing well, they ordered less, at the back half of the [indiscernible] we actually saw a change to that or it's actually a little strong, but before the customer stepped up and ordered tremendous amounts of equipment, especially the fourth quarter. Do you think [indiscernible] that customers are going to be ordering equipment [indiscernible] or adding capacity vis-\u00e0-vis their own business or do you think that was for a little bit of an anomalistic situation?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes, you were breaking up a little bit, but I think I got the essence of your question. And we've been doing a lot of thinking about this particular issue. And the essence, I think, of what's happening kind of has a few elements. First of all, the smartphone and tablet demand is accelerating. So it's pretty fast, and to keep up with that ramp, foundries are going to have to move more quickly. Over the last couple of years, die sizes have doubled or you could say die sizes are kind of going up at a 50% a year kind of level, which is pretty unprecedented for the applications, processors, which are the major silicon consumer there. Then the other thing is that because these die sizes are going up, you've got to move to the leading edge very, very quickly. And as we've all certainly seen, as these smartphones change model, everybody moves to the new model immediately. So there's a lot of pressure for foundries to be ahead on capacity and be in a position to supply the demand that's coming, even though their utilization might be not the 95% or 90% where they use to wait until that point to order significant amount of new capacity.","Operator","Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, first question, if we were to assume, I guess, the higher end of your WFE guide, let's call it flat to down 5%. How would you see seasonality first half versus second half in terms of silicon shipments?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes, C.J., if we would take the midpoint, if I could just kind of move your question to if you kind of look at our midpoint of down 7% or so, it's close enough to down 5%, we think that you'd have to see equal first half, second half. And that the kind of puts and takes there would be more NAND spending, a little less foundry spending and a little more DRAM spending, logic, kind of ratable across the year. So if we would think that we're going to be able to get to the high-end of that range to flat, I think we'd have to see a little more foundry spending, probably a little more NAND spending.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And as my follow-up, can you talk about, George, the trajectory of OpEx that we should expect post the April quarter? Clearly, there's pluses and minuses there in terms of volatility to the top line, but as you see it today, what kind of cost savings do you think we could see in the next couple quarters?","George S. Davis","Yes, I think you're seeing some cost savings already in the non-semiconductor areas, but we're continuing to increase spending in the semi again. Really, there's just an extraordinary number of activities going on with customers that are important to do right now for positioning. But we'll continue to see improvements in the cost structure in our businesses that are in the bottom of the down cycle. But some of those are variable. So I think the current run rate in the $550 million to $565 million range is probably a reasonable place to assume we'll be.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So regarding your silicon bookings in the coming quarter, can you give us at least directionally, how do you think about the different segments, foundry, NAND, et cetera?","George S. Davis","Sure, for Q2, Edwin?","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Yes. Sorry, regarding your silicon booking guidance. So as regarding the coming quarter, that's all and -- yes.","George S. Davis","Yes, as we said, we said foundry revenues were going to be up significantly. We also see bookings being up as well quarter-over-quarter for foundry customers. Flash had a pretty good bounce last quarter. We see it being kind of flattish, and then, and same with DRAM and logic. So really it's a foundry story as we see it. And that's I guess why we\u2019re calling it the year of the foundry.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe, that's your...","George S. Davis","That -- yes, yes, yes, it was -- sorry, Edwin, go ahead.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, no problem at all. And then one follow up on AGS, just curious how 200-millimeter is trending, within AGS and its booking and revenue in 200-millimeter is still pretty low here, and can you state any kind of improvement there?","George S. Davis","No, I'd say that's a good description of where we are. The -- it's been pretty light on bookings and on revenues at the end of last year, but more so this -- in the first half of this year. We do expect that actually to pick it up though we're seeing signs from customers that they need to add capacity, particularly in selected areas. So we expect it to be a little down overall from last year, but to recover and that will be a source of improvement in the second half.","Michael R. Splinter","Edwin, we think the automotive market is coming back and electronics in there, especially power electronics is going to help drive a little pickup in 200-millimeter. But I think we would be happy if we improve margins and it was flat to up year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Thanks for taking my question, I have 2 of them. Mike, if I look at memory spending, I understand the secular drivers for NAND. And both NAND and DRAM, it seems like the beginning of the year, there's all this optimism that they come back in second half. But over the past couple of years, it never panned out exactly. I'm kind of wondering like what gives you the confidence this year memory spending will come back in the second half, and I have a follow-up?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes, I think if we, first of all, just say NAND spending, I think that talking to customers, it would be the broadening out from the current set of customers to at least one additional customer that we believe is going to make some more significant NAND investments in the second half of the year. Our expectation for DRAM is very modest, so it's just kind of a timing of when they're going to make their investments to move their lines to the next generation. They have -- just to be competitive, they have to keep moving node to node to node. We don't expect any capacity investments in DRAM at all.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then in...","Michael R. Splinter","If I'm mistaken, we got it in the first [ph].","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up. On the Varian synergy, you said you might exceed the $60 million target, where is most of the savings coming from? Is this SG&A or are you seeing a lot of savings in -- on the COGS line too?","George S. Davis","Yes. I mean, when we first announced the synergies, Krish, we said that maybe 60% would be coming out of OpEx, maybe 40% in cost of sales. And what we're seeing is much more opportunity in cost of sales. And so we would expect maybe those ratios to change a little bit. We also have seen some additional opportunities in SG&A, so overall, we think that's why we're confident we're going to be able to increase the number. And as we get a little bit further along, we'll set a new and higher target.","Operator","Your next question comes from Srini Sundararajan with Oppenheimer.","Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","My question is with EUV likely to be inserted only around 2014. Do you expect additional sales from SADP and maybe quadruple patterning?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes. First of all, our view on EUV is pretty consistent with what you said. I just add to that, that as it comes into production, it's really going to come in at one layer, probably contact layer first, get into production for one year or maybe another layer as we go through time. But I think the insertion, because of the costs are going to -- and need to get to productized are going to be relatively slow. So the net of that is that double patterning, quadruple patterning is pretty much here to stay. We kind of view that our SAM gets increased by about $800 million with those applications today as it gets applied to more layers, that'll grow over the next few years. So we think with or without EUV and how it's going to go into production, not much change to the current trends.","Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. I have just one follow up. Looking back at Varian, can you  tell me something that make you feel that you made the right decision?","Michael R. Splinter","I can tell you a lot of things. But let me just start with the Varian team. I mean that bringing the Varian team into Applied has already had some great effects. As you get to see how we're integrating the company, you'll see Varian executives and a number of different jobs throughout Applied. In the end, when you buy a company, you buy the people and the culture, as well as the products. So I mean that's one that we're really excited about, probably more -- way more excited than, certainly, the day we bought -- announced that we bought the company. Then just the way our technical people are working together and finding synergy and issues, areas to do experiments together on. I think we have a great opportunity. These will take some time to talk to customers about and get into solving the customer problems. But I think that's another one that is going to be very, very exciting. And then just the matchup of the strategies. We think the solar product is going to be very good over a period of time. And so when you put all those things together and we save more than we announced at the beginning on synergy, we're still incredibly excited about acquiring Varian. George, would you add anything?","George S. Davis","Sure, I've got to throw in a couple of numbers. But obviously, they were non-GAAP accretive, and they're right out the gate as we said they would be. And in the second quarter, as we look, they could be close to GAAP accretive. So they got a lot of leverage in their performance model, as do we. I think that was maybe underestimated by -- as you could see in the consensus, why we came in so much stronger when you saw an uptick in the semi business. So there is just -- their business model works well with ours. The people are outstanding. And not only are we able to help them in areas, but they've got some practices that, quite frankly, that will help us and we're adopting as well. So it's the kind of acquisition you like to see and everything we've seen so far says it's only better than we thought.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have 2 questions. One is we saw actually very strong December quarter performance from a few of your Japanese competitors. But then we saw these competitors guide March bookings down, contrasting what you and your U.S. peers have seen. I was wondering what is your view on F2Q orders in this context and what could explain the difference between the strong order momentum you and your U.S. peers are seeing versus what some of your Japanese counterparts are not seeing in the March quarter?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes, well, the Japanese companies typically are on a different fiscal year. And if you look at their order pattern over time, it always moves with more of a 6-month cycle than a 3-month cycle. So I [ph] know that I could say anything more intelligent about what -- how their business goes, but for us, it's clearly exposure to foundries. Our strong position with those foundries that are buying today. And so that's really the essence of it for us quarter-over-quarter and how we see the first 6 months of the year.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up question with the year coming to a close, if you look at your market share in silicon equipment throughout 2011, how did that market share progress compare to the targets that you set out one year ago? And what are your targets looking forward one year? If you can maybe highlight some of the share gain opportunities and challenges in your silicon business now.","Michael R. Splinter","Sure. So I said some things during my prepared remarks, but maybe I can just kind of summarize. On the macro, on wafer fab equipment spending including everything, including MOCVD, we saw a pretty big spending shift towards lithography. That spending shift basically on a percentage basis, shrinks our TAM or shrinks our SAM. So we saw a 2- to 3-point downward shift because of that during 2011, primarily -- and that was -- caused a lot of line upgrades, also in logic, a big shift to immersion lithography. We expect that to -- and you can kind of see the change now that we're maybe through that period except for DRAM. I think DRAM's only going to do technology upgrades for a while. But as we look at our product line, we think we have great opportunity to gain share virtually in every area. We did gain share in all of our major areas. ECP gained double digits last year. We gained in metal deposition, in CVD. We lost in CMP and etch where we have good chance to bounce back this year and gain points there. In our Inspection division, we gained last year, at least one point of overall share. We expect, with wins we\u2019ve already seen this year, that we'll also gain this year. And in that area, in Inspection, we really had a shift in the business over the last few years to really the bulk of our business was with the top 3 or 4 manufacturer customers as opposed in previous years, it was quite different. If there's any specific product line that you'd like to know about, we can cover it or we can cover it after the call.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mike, I had a question, when you thought about the year, you kind of gave some projections for the different product divisions you have. It seems like we've had a little bit of adjustment here. Could you give us a little thoughts on maybe, over and under, it sounds like flat panel and EES might be weaker than you thought, maybe that's offset by better silicon -- semi equipment sales?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes. Certainly, back in November when we started, we certainly underestimated where we thought we would -- where we are today with semiconductor equipment sales. As we said, really, the thrust by foundries to get capacity in place has been the biggest part of that. Our flat panel display seems to push out -- has been pushing out. We've been expecting factories in China that buildings have been built to start to get facilitized. Those things seem to be getting pushed out. We're seeing a little bit of capacity digestion in touch panels right now, but we do expect that technology and that product line to come back with the growth in tablets and during this year sometime. In solar, I think this is pretty much what we expected. If anything, we're surprised by how strong the end demand is. So if we look at the kind of effective capacity there, we think there is kind of effective capacity of 40 -- a little over 40 gigawatts. There is nameplate capacity over 50 gigawatts, but when you look at who can make solar cells that will sell, it's really a little bit over 40 gigawatts. If demand gets up to 35 gigawatts, this year, that's a significant closure of the gap of the capacity demand gap that we're dealing with right now. And you could see a more normal kind of buying pattern than we're seeing today.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question I had was just kind of tied to gross margin expectations throughout the year. You have a very concentrated customer exposure beginning the year and it sounds like you expect this to kind of mitigate as we go through the year. So in general, should this improve overall the gross margin structure for the company or how do you think we should kind of trend that out?","George S. Davis","Hey, Chris, that's good question. I think what you're seeing is a couple of factors: Number one, gross margin improving, in general, in our semiconductor businesses with volume and -- but also the gross margin improving as the mix of our business changes in the year. With the softness in our non-semi businesses, what we referred to as the semi-businesses, which is SSG and AM AGS, which is largely serving semi customers, you get a close to a 90% mix now of those businesses which were down in the kind of 80% or less range last year. So you're getting a much better flow-through and that's reflected in the margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mike, question on longer-term. There is certain segments like PVD and RTP, Epi. CMP, where you have more than 70% market share. As your customer prepare to move for 450 nanometer -- sorry, 450 millimeter. Do you think that the smaller competitor can survive, can take and invest in the 450 millimeter and as a result, on that concern, you might begin to get 100% market share on those segments?","Michael R. Splinter","We can always hope that the smaller guys, but they've been awfully resilient in this industry over a long period of time. What we're trying to do here is work closely with the customers, understand their needs and timing so that we don't, first of all, invest too soon or too late, that we put our investments in the places that are going to be needed. I said earlier that we're looking at the early test wafer systems. And we're pretty specifically focused there because that's what our customers need first. So that test wafers can be run, robotics can be tested, defects can be measured and the like. So we're going to make sure that Applied Materials is very well positioned going into 450 millimeter so that our solutions are there for the customers. We're solving their problems in the 300-millimeter generations ahead of 450 millimeter because we believe that there is a lot of risk in transitioning to 450-millimeter. If we can maximize our position in 300 millimeter going into that transition, that will be the best possible scenario for Applied Materials. Then we have to make sure we're managing our spending very tightly so that we don't get ahead of the game or behind the game. But we're going to be lockstep with the customers is the best way that I can try to describe it.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And also on the SSD subsegments, where are you most excited about in terms of above market growth? I mean, there is -- you participate in several segments, but my sense is that transistor is becoming a lot more complicated and you have several markets, I mean, implant RTP, Epi, metal gate, if I take all these together, where do you think you see more growth, I mean, if I look at all your SSD subsegments?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes, well, I'm certainly excited about all of them. But if you make me pick 1 or 2, especially focused in on the transistors where we're going to see a lot of change. We're going to see a lot of change on the memory cells. So we're getting ourselves prepared to help customers make those transitions. Epi has been one of those areas that doesn't get noticed a whole lot. It's a product inside of our front-end products group. But pretty much now with each generation, there is an added Epi step, at least in Logic and foundry. In the future, we\u2019re going to see a need for Epi in the channels, so we'll have additional Epi steps. We'll see probably in generations to come, Epi needed on memory devices to enhance the performance of the transistors. And then as we go to vertical NAND, I think we got a lot of opportunity on both our deposition, our CVD products and our PVD products. And finally, if you look across all these different things, they're all going to need more and more implants. It was part of the analysis that we did when we bought Varian, but we see the number of adjustments and dialing in of the performance of the various transistors to accelerate with time here. So we think that, if I really, really have to narrow it down, then I get to Epi and implant.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mike, you mentioned 70% of your sales were from 3 customers. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your order concentration in the last quarter and also maybe the next quarter?","George S. Davis","The order -- this is George, Vishal. The order concentration was right on top of the revenue concentration, maybe just slightly higher. And again, it's looking sort of equally concentrated in the second quarter.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. And maybe you could talk a little bit about your expectations for revenue growth this year. You said that litho was very strong last year. How do you see your revenues in fiscal 2012 grow compared to overall industry?","Michael R. Splinter","Well, maybe we could wait for that projection until our March Analyst Meeting. I think we'd feel a little more comfortable and have a little better view of what's going to happen in the second half. I think you get an idea from the discussion about there's pretty good momentum in our view that wafer fab equipment spending will be over $30 billion. So I think we're quite confident on where we'll be with our semiconductor and service. The service division will grow quarter-by-quarter through the year. I think where there are still a lot of uncertainty as in our other 2 divisions, the Display and EES, on exactly how their performance is going to trend through the year. So if you'd give us a little bit of a pass for a few weeks here before our Analyst Meeting, I will give you a lot more detail then.","Operator","Your next question comes from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of things. Firstly, on your comments on market share in response to an earlier question. I wanted to probe a bit into the etch and CMP portion, and you said customer mix was the reason overall share was lower, because my interpretation that the market share for etch and CMP is lower at the top 3 customers or how should we think about that?","Michael R. Splinter","Well, our etch business is very much towards DRAM and memory in particular. So especially during this last year, we suffered quite a bit because of the low spending in those areas. Spending mix was down, so that certainly hurt our Etch business substantially. Where we're really focused with the etch business is on the patterning applications. We think that the solution that we have with Centris offers better performance, certainly better productivity and uniformity than the competition. So we think our focusing in into that area should give us an opportunity to grow back some share this year and then in the years to come. In CMP, it was really just a spending shift, who is spending more, who is spending less. And I think that we'll see a pop back on CMP share this year to previous high levels.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on a longer-term question on NAND flash, SanDisk, on its Analyst Day, said a few things, what -- they expect the long-term cost reductions for NAND to almost decline in half to maybe 30% a year down from the low-50% it used to be. And they expect, I guess, that might slow down the rate of wafer capacity adds. How do you sort of think about NAND evolution, longer-term, if the cost reduction were to slow? And what can AMAT do that could push the cost reduction backup?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes. I'm not sure of everything they said. But NAND certainly benefited from being able to go faster than Moore's law for many, many years. So I think that's one of those impacts that's affecting NAND. I still think the biggest cost reducer is how much of their mix they can put on multicell -- multi-bit devices. But I think the demand is going to continue to grow pretty rapidly because of this mobile trend. So perhaps more of the footprint -- more of the dollar footprint ends up in NAND or we decide we don't need as much capacity. But I think the trend has been pretty clear that for servers with Windows 8 and ultrabooks coming in SSDs will grow dramatically. And the amount of flash in the rest of the mobile world will grow with each generation. We're working very hard, double patterning, quadruple patterning works the best in flash. Then moving to a vertical NAND structure should allow them to get significant cost-per-bit reductions. So we're working very closely with them. We think we have some enabling technology, especially for vertical NAND. But that's still a few years away from getting to production, but those discussions are happening today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolas.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Mike, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're expecting bit growth in DRAM to be about 30% to 40% this year. Do you see a level of where you would get a tipping point for where actual capacity buys return versus the conversions you're seeing today?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes, we think it\u2019s -- certainly above 40%, more like 50% if we start to see a bit growth over 50%, we think some capacity will have to be added. But last year was pretty close to 50% and we didn't see -- we just saw, really, conversions coming through. So we'll wait and see, but I think the key still with DRAM is how fast do PCs and how fast the ultrabooks get adopted, and how many -- how much DRAM capacity per PC. That starts moving up, you could easily see 50% growth, but we just don't see it today.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And maybe a question for George in terms of the cycle times or the lead times you guys have been doing on the SSG side of things. It sounds like you still got -- you still have a pretty high level of turns business given the orders and the rapid turn in revenues, is that still the case?","George S. Davis","It is still the case. But again, the cycle times while they have improved ratably over time, a lot of the turns business reflects certain customers' preferences to kind of bring orders very close to the shipment date even though you have letters of understanding and a lot of dialogue with the customers over time. So some of that turn business is really a reflection of the way of operating in certain customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Pang with Caris & Company.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones. First, on the $30 billion to $35 billion on the wafer fab equipment, what's the -- on the low end of that, what changes in your view?","Michael R. Splinter","Yes, if we would go to the low end of the spectrum, we would not see -- we would see DRAM stay at the low level that we're seeing in the first half and we'd see a bigger drop-off in foundry and logic.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So your current outlook, that $30 billion, the DRAM would still be lower than where it is right now or what you're projecting right now?","Michael R. Splinter","So we wouldn't see any improvement in the second half.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and the second question is also on the wafer fab equipment spend, you commented that litho was a bigger percentage in 2011. Do you think that trend continues in 2012?","Michael R. Splinter","I think it will remain roughly flat in 2012, maybe down a little bit as a percent as the trend that we cited for last year played out.","George S. Davis","And again, I think our view is you start to see that change maybe come down a little bit as memory starts to add capacity instead of upgrading [indiscernible].","Operator","Your final question comes from Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on the competitive environment, obviously, one of your major competitors is buying another competitor, with SSD and [ph] etch combined. Now I'm just wondering if you -- how do you see the competitive environment going forward?","Michael R. Splinter","Sure, well, we certainly weren't surprised by that move. Obviously, we've been on this strategy for a while with the acquisition of Semitool and then Varian. So that's we certainly been trying to position ourselves ahead of the competition. As far as this particular move, we're pretty familiar with both of these companies and have competed with them for many, many years. As we cited, we think we've been in a strong position and improving our share in electroplating and in CVD and PVD, which have been prime competitive fronts with one of those 2 companies. We've had less success in etch, but we know certainly the game plan here, and feel like we know how to compete, and we'll meet them in the marketplace as we always do.","Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then one more question, I know that you want to maybe wait a bit until -- and give us more details later, but obviously, we've had pretty strong growth and you're guiding for strong growth in SSD through April. But for just like assuming a flat, July and October, it looks like fiscal year SSG numbers could be up 10% to 15%. I'm just wondering if we could expect a softer July and October?","Michael R. Splinter","Well, I don't think we can really say. I think we tried to outline what we thought on the spending. If we would pick the middle of our range on WFE, we think our performance would be flat first half to second half, but right now it's pretty hard to nail down that range.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Mark For your question. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today.

We appreciate you joining us for our second quarter of fiscal 2017 earnings call which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including those about Applied's current view of its industries, performance, product road map, share positions, revenue growth and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and are not guarantees of future performance.","Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of May 18, 2017 and Applied assumes no obligation to update them.","Today's call also includes non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike. I'm very happy to report another record-breaking quarter for Applied Materials with the highest revenue and earnings in our history. We've now set earnings records for 4 quarters in a row and as I look across the company, I see tremendous momentum. Our markets are strong and getting stronger and we're sustainably growing faster than these markets by expanding our served opportunity and gaining share.","In today's call, I will provide our perspective on the factors driving the industry and our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth within this environment. I will then describe the key inflections and investments within our markets before concluding with updates on our major businesses. Bob will then provide additional detail about our performance and outlook.","Let me start with the big picture. This is an incredibly exciting period for the electronics industry, with a broader set of drivers and a wider spectrum of companies making very large investments to advance semiconductor and display technology. In the past, PCs were the dominant factor in semiconductor demand. PCs drove the technology road map and enterprise refresh cycles drove industry upturns and downturns. More recently, global adoption of smartphones, combined with social media, have created a much more pervasive consumer demand, expanding the market and making it substantially less cyclical. Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. The impact for Applied is twofold. First, our markets are growing and becoming more stable. Second, this is a period of incredible innovation in logic, memory and display and we're in a great position to provide the critical building blocks needed to move the industry forward.","At Applied, our strategy is to be the innovation leader in markets that are evolving faster than ever before. To do that, we fueled innovation by reallocating resources and significantly increasing our investment in new product development. Then, to drive repeatable success and accelerate the pace of learning, we've developed a unique operating system, our product development engine and trained more than 10,000 employees how to use it. Across the organization, we're focused on delivering highly differentiated products and services that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before. I believe our innovation leadership is sustainable because of the breadth and depth of our capabilities. Our ability to combine unique competencies, technology and intellectual property accelerates our innovation process and sets us apart from competitors.","Having provided this context, I'll now describe the major inflections and investments taking place within our markets. Sales of memory chips are at record levels, fueled by increasing content in smartphones to support better cameras and VR applications as well as the need for more and higher performance storage in data centers. Market fundamentals remain strong and as a result, we're seeing robust investment from our memory customers. We believe we will see double-digit growth in DRAM spending this year and we expect NAND investment to be even stronger. Our view of 2018 and beyond is also positive for a number of reasons. The explosion of data storage requirements created by IoT, big data, AI and streaming video has only just begun. Data generation from new categories, such as Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicles, can potentially dwarf existing applications within a few years. As 3D NAND bit density increases and cost per bit falls, new segments of the storage market are opening up for solid-state drives. And at the same time, the bit density increase from generation to generation is slower for 3D than it was for planar NAND. To compensate, the industry needs more wafer starts and greenfield capacity.","In foundry, we're also seeing an acceleration of investment, both at the leading edge and in trailing geometries. In 2017, we expect investment in new leading edge capacity to make up about 60% of total foundry spending. This is driven by demand for more sophisticated smartphone processors as well as customers positioning to win the major inflections in high-performance computing and data centers that are needed to start unlocking the potential of AI. Within foundry, logic and DRAM, I'm increasingly excited about our opportunities in patterning. As these customers move to smaller chip geometries, all the layers in the device scale. A limited number of layers will move to EUV, but significantly more will move to multi-patterning. This means our patterning opportunity will expand considerably over the coming years. Applied is making significant investments to enable the patterning road map. We've already increased our patterning revenues more than 60% in the past year and still have significant room to grow.","Taking all these factors into consideration, we now believe that wafer fab equipment spending for the calendar year could be up about 15% relative to 2016 and our outlook for 2018 and beyond remains positive. Our expectations for the display market also continue to strengthen as a result of large inflections in both TV and mobile screen technology. Average TV sizes are expected to reach 44.5 inches in 2017, up 5 inches in the past 3 years. One of the key factors driving this growth is demand for large-format TVs, 60 inches and above. As customers optimize factories for these bigger screen sizes, they are investing in new Gen 10.5 capacity. In parallel, we see investment in mobile OLED getting stronger as confidence in the adoption rates of OLED technology increases. Recent forecasts indicate that 2\/3 of new smartphones could have OLED displays by 2021 and screen manufacturers are accelerating their investment plans accordingly.","My final comments about the market environment relate to China which is an important long term growth opportunity for Applied. We believe 2017 spending will be slightly higher than last year. And based on the projects we're tracking, we expect to see a significant and steady investment ramp in both semiconductor and display beginning in 2018.","I'll now provide updates on the performance and priorities for our major business groups. Overall, Applied gained 2 points of wafer fab equipment share in 2016 and based on the strength of our product portfolio, I believe we'll add to those gains over the next several years. In our leadership businesses, such as PVD, epi, implant and thermal processing, where we have strong share and highly differentiated products, we're extending our advantage. The available market for our leadership products is also growing, specifically in PVD and CMP. In PVD, we expect our available market to expand by more than 30% in 2017 as foundry customers adopt new interconnect technology for lower power devices. And the CMP market grew 40% in 2016 and is on track to grow another 20% this year, primarily driven by increasing steps in 3D NAND.","In our high-growth businesses, we're also outperforming our competitors in markets that are growing rapidly. In 2016, we gained about 5 points of share in conductor etch and 2 points in etch overall. This means that since 2012, we've won nearly 20 points of conductor share and 10 points of total etch share. These gains are driven by enabling technologies, like Sym3 and selective etch and new process steps. Our CVD business is also outpacing the market, gaining almost 6 points of market share in 2016. We have great momentum in these businesses and plenty of headroom to grow.","Service represents a stable and growing revenue stream for the company. On a year-on-year basis, we've now grown service revenues for 14 consecutive quarters and our compound rate of growth has been around 10% over the past 4 years. Our expanding portfolio of service solutions plays an increasingly important role for customers, helping them compress ramp times, improving device performance and yield and optimize output and operating costs. Because of this, I'm confident that we can continue to grow service at a similar pace.","Another exciting growth opportunity for Applied is display. Since 2012, we've grown display revenues around 20% per year and we have great momentum. This year, we're on track to book more than $2 billion of orders. Display technology and manufacturing is becoming increasingly complex and Applied is in a unique position to enable the road map. By leveraging our semiconductor experience and capabilities, we're delivering the innovative products our customers need to accelerate major technology transitions.","Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me quickly summarize. Q2 was another record-breaking quarter and 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for Applied. Our markets are becoming even more attractive. They are growing sustainably and becoming less volatile. And Applied is playing a larger and more valuable role advancing the innovation road map. We have focused our strategy and investments to ensure that Applied is the innovation leader that consistently delivers highly differentiated products and services. As a result, we're raising the ceiling for our performance and potential. We're setting new records, growing our available market and gaining market share.","Now let me hand the call over to Bob.","Robert Halliday","Thanks, Gary. Before going into the details of the quarter, I'll touch on 3 things that are sustainably better for Applied, one, our markets; two, our improving position in those markets which is enabling stronger gross margin performance; and three, our profitability and free cash flow. First, our markets are more attractive. We believe wafer fab equipment spending will be higher and less volatile for the foreseeable future. Display equipment spending also looks higher and more attractive, for Applied Materials in particular, because we're greatly increasing our served addressable market. Many of you have added valuable insights as to why WFE has become larger and less volatile. I believe it boils down to three things, one, the semiconductor market is growing and becoming more diverse; two, equipment intensity is increasing; and three, capital investment is measured and rational.","This better industry environment is sustainable. As Gary mentioned, the semiconductor industry we enable has also become larger, more diverse and more critical to big innovations in the global economy. Today, we're seeing the emergence of new silicon-rich devices needed to enable the Internet of Things, cloud data centers and artificial intelligence. Data is becoming more valuable and harnessing the value requires silicon. For Applied, this translates to higher demand for logic and memory capacity at both the leading edge and trailing geometries. I believe the industry has seen a new wave of sustainable growth with economic value creation that justifies the cost of investment.","Next, Applied's position in the markets in sustainably stronger. The changes we've made since 2013 in strategy, capital allocation and business systems, like the product development engine, have given us our strongest product pipeline in many years. I've been invited to an industrials conference this month to explain how our products are enabling big changes in manufacturing that many people call Industry 4.0. Here is how I plan to summarize our contribution without going into all of the technology.","Applied has a very strong overall business that can be separated into just 2 parts. First, we have our leadership semi equipment and services business which together generate nearly 60% of our revenue. Our leadership semi businesses drive technologies that are critical to making transistors for data processing and networking. We've maintained steady growth and high share positions averaging about 70% because we bring unique value to our customers. Our services business is similar in that it is highly enabling to our customers and characterized by steady, profitable growth. We're deeply engaged with our logic and foundry customers to enable their advanced road maps with this part of our business. When you think about the big new chips used for artificial intelligence, think of Applied Materials.","Second, we have our high-growth businesses which include etch and deposition used in 3D NAND and multi-patterning, along with inspection and display. Our high-growth businesses now represent about 40% of our revenue. We've made outsized investments in new and disruptive products in these areas to capitalize on the inflections we identified in 2013. Our high-growth semi businesses have been growing 40% faster than their markets and Applied's unique display equipment business is growing even faster.","Another way to measure Applied's stronger position in the markets is to consider the changes in our share by semiconductor device type. In 2012, our share in foundry was over 20%, but our share in logic, DRAM and NAND was under 15%. Today, we believe our share is at least 22% in all 4. In fact, we're the #1 equipment company by revenue in NAND, DRAM, logic and foundry. So regardless of the spending mix, applied is well positioned.","A great measure of the strength of our products, the value they bring to our customers and our execution as a company is gross margin expansion. Since 2013, we have increased our gross margins in our semi, services and display segments across virtually every business unit. In 2017, I believe we will deliver company non-GAAP gross margin of about 46% which would be up by about 5 points versus 2012 and the company's best annual performance in a decade.","Now I'll talk about how these changes are flowing through the income statement to enable stronger profitability and shareholder returns. Over the 2013 to 2016 period, we have grown the revenue line by 44%. When we compared 2017 to 2013, we can see revenue growth of 90%. This revenue growth demonstrates the compounding benefits of our share gains and new product penetrations across semi, services and display. For the year, we expect our top line growth, gross margin performance and disciplined R&D investment and spending to generate the highest non-GAAP operating margin of the past 17 years and free cash flow of 20% or more. The company has returned 100% of the free cash flow we generated over the past 5 years and stands committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders.","Next, I'll comment on our performance during Q2. As a reminder, we no longer report quarterly orders because we're focused on driving year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. Quarter-to quarter demand patterns can vary across our business. However, we have grown our revenue and non-GAAP EPS on a year-over-year basis in 14 of the past 15 quarters. In Q2, we grew company revenue by 45% year-over-year and increased non-GAAP gross margin by 3.6 points. Our non-GAAP operating expenses grew by only 14% over this period and we continue to invest 2\/3 of OpEx in R&D to fuel our product development engine. We set new company records in profitability as we increased non-GAAP operating profit by 110% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share by 132% year-over-year.","Now I'll compare our Q2 segment performance to the same period last year. We grew semiconductor systems revenue by 51% to $2.4 billion and non-GAAP operating margin by 9.7 points. We grew services revenue by 14% to a record $724 million and non-GAAP operating margin by 80 basis points. We more than doubled our display revenue to $391 million and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 4.9 points.","Turning to the balance sheet. We grew cash from operations by 87% compared to the same period last year. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion of cash and investments and nearly half was onshore. This increase includes proceeds from $2.2 billion in debt raised in March to increase onshore liquidity. Soon after the end of the quarter, we used approximately $200 million of the offering to redeem our October 2017 notes. We returned $390 million to shareholders in the quarter, paying $108 million in dividend and using $282 million to repurchase 7 million shares of stock at an average price of $38.15.","Now I'll provide our third quarter guidance. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.75 billion. The midpoint would be up by 30% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, our semiconductor systems revenue should increase by about 41%. Services revenue should increase by about 13%. And display revenue should increase by about 27%. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 46.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $665 million, plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $0.79 to $0.87, the midpoint of which would be up by 66% year-over-year.","Finally, to help you with your models, we project revenue in Corporate and Other to be around $15 million. We expect non-GAAP interest and other expenses of about $42 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 10.2%. And in the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP OpEx to be around $675 million. The projected increase is primarily targeted at R&D for new opportunities we're pursuing in emerging inflections.","To summarize, one, our markets are sustainably better than at any other time in the history of the company; two, our competitive position and execution is sustainably better, giving us a strong pipeline of new and disruptive products and gross margin expansion; three, this growth, combined with disciplined investment and spending, is generating higher free cash flow and we're committed to returning the excess to our shareholders.","Now Mike, let's start the Q&A.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions]. Let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI.","Christopher Muse","I guess question around sustainability. You're guiding WFE $40-plus billion here for '17. And curious, what gives you the confidence to be so upbeat looking into '18 and beyond? And I guess as part of that, would love to hear your thoughts in terms of the contributions from areas like AI and public cloud investments versus, I guess, more traditional areas like smartphone and PCs in the past.","Robert Halliday","Sure. Let me see if I can try to give you context. I think context rather than point answer is useful, give you context over time and context over breadth. So if you look at context, we thought back at Analyst Day last September that 2016 WFE would be about $33.7 billion. And in fact, it ended up a little over $35 billion. We thought at Analyst Day last year, this year would be $34.5 billion. And in fact, it started with a 4 number this year and it looks very healthy. So it's trending up. So then you say, well, where is it trending up? It's kind of up across the board. Earlier in the year, we thought it was kind of 5% up across the board. Now we think the whole thing is up 15%.","We're seeing in DRAM, NAND, foundry. Tactically, we're seeing high utilization in all the fabs. We see no diminution of ordering patterns. We don't see double bookings or anything people might fear. So we see -- when you see strength across virtually every customer and virtually every device type, that goes to some root cause questions. So in my opinion, we're facing what we've been talking about for a while which is, there is more root cause demand drivers for devices. Now longer term, those root drive cause factors are going to be things like cars and AR\/VR. What we're seeing now is tactically more content in the phones. We see a lot more content in the phones around NAND, DRAM and we also see strength within the processor side on both the cutting edge and the lagging edge. Lagging edge, again, this year, will be over 40% of device types. But the cutting edge is pretty strong, too. So we're seeing broadscale demand.","My belief is that in the intermediate term, there's more content going in phones and more going into the big data centers which are both driving this which will help us. So then the question is, why is there more going in? We believe that there's, what I call broadly speaking, more applications for processor technology, more apps on top of it that are driving systemic demand. And I think, frankly, we're in the early innings of it. So if you ask me, okay, is the second half good? Yes, we're okay. If you ask me, is '18 good? Yes, I think it probably starts with a 4 again. It's pretty good. If you ask me long term which is what I spend a lot of time on, I see more root cause drivers for growth in semiconductor and silicon growth than I've seen in years and I think it's sustainable.","Gary Dickerson","And C.J., this is Gary. If you look out over time what drove our business in the past were the enterprise and PC upgrade cycles, then it moved to mobile, social media, very pervasive and driven by holiday season new products, where all of the consumer electronics companies had to have those products ready for Christmas or Chinese New Year. And as you go forward, we talked about AI and the importance of capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data is really going to disrupt big industries, transportation, health care, entertainment, manufacturing. And when you look at AI chips, almost every week, somebody's announcing a new AI chip, that it's at the -- logic devices that are at the physical limits of how big they can build those chips because there's so much value in these changes that are happening in these major industries. And of course, that's great for us. If you're building these big logic chips, you need better transistors, you need much better interconnect technology and you also need more memory which is materials-enabled and another area that's in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. So longer term, these inflections really create even more sustainability in terms of our markets going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","On the China domestic semiconductor market and the outlook there, especially as we think about looking into 2018, I think conservatively, we're tracking 3 to 4 domestic foundry programs and about 4 to 5 memory programs. Foundry, obviously, is a bit more mature. Memory, we're kind of early innings, like Phase 1 kind of development. But especially on sort of memory in China and we get this question a lot from investors which is, is the team starting to get pipeline visibility into some of these programs actually starting to fire the confidence level that these programs are going to contribute to potentially a growth outlook for 2018? Love to get your views here.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, thanks for the question. China's one of our strongest regions for both semiconductor and display, very deep customer relationships. And what we're looking at for 2017, if we compare to '15, it's about 2x growth in our semiconductor business, 50% growth in service, 50% in display. And the business is really driven by a couple of different strategic factors. One is, there's a big gap between supply and demand and there's this large drive to try to close that gap and then also building a secure supply chain. When we look into 2018, what we're seeing right now is that the overall wafer fab equipment spending could be meaningfully up, more than $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion from '17 to '18 and the domestic part of that increase is also up a meaningful amount in 2018. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything else?","Robert Halliday","Yes, I think that's pretty accurate. And if you ask us to look longer term, we see the domestic -- we see the total going up basically every year and the domestic part, in particular, going up every year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company.","Timothy Arcuri","Bob, I actually have 2 questions. Number one, just on the recent debt raise. I know you paid down $200 million of debt with that money. But I'm surprised that there's not kind of a new capital return that was announced with that. So I guess that's my first question. And then I wanted to also ask about SSG in the back half of the year because if I run the numbers on calendar first half of the year, you're sort of annualizing to like $42 billion WFE roughly. And if we're going to be at $40 billion for the year, then that would sort of say that the back half has to be down like roughly 10%. So I'm wondering if that math's right.","Robert Halliday","Yes, 2 complicated questions. The first one, we raised money frankly from an opportunistic point of view and frankly a shareholder perspective. So if you look it, we raised $2.2 billion, now we had to repay $2 billion -- $200 million, so it's about $2 billion net. And it was about 50% of it was 10-year money, about 50% was 30-year money. And the 10% money, maybe like 3.3% and 4.3%, okay? So the average rate is about 3.8%. So basically what we're bringing into our capital structure is long term debt at low rates that's pseudo-equity at low cost of capital. So that's pretty attractive. The second thing we're doing, many people believe that there'll be some type of tax policy change this year or next which will ease and facilitate the return of cash from overseas locations.","Well, we're kind of hedging our bets. We're not sure about the timing and we want to stay committed to shareholder returns and keep our tax structure in place until there are any substantive changes. So I think this raise, if anything, was to continue to support meaningful returns of capital to investors. And as we said on the call, we've returned over 100% over the last 5 years. In this past quarter, the total was over $380 million, I think, between dividends and buybacks. So I think we're very committed to shareholder returns. We will hit the model which is shrinking the share count. And if we get more line of sight to what's going to happen on the tax policy, then we'll clearly react more effectively and more efficiently to how to maximize those shareholder returns. In terms of the -- how's the year look, we gave in the call a few data points. One, we said that our revenues in '17 fiscal year versus '13 were going to be up 90%.","So you can see, we're going to have a good year. So my take on it is, the year is a good year. Our take on it is the year will continue to strengthen throughout the year. Our take on it is that we're going to gain share this year. So it's going to be a really good year for us. And that's just semi. Display, we're going to do well, too. We believe those drivers that drive the market and our share continue for a number of years. So is the number a $40 billion number or north of a $40 billion number? All we want to say now here in early May is it starts with a 4. It's up significantly from last year and it strengthened all year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","My question is, you've already talked about it quite a bit. Generally just wondering if you guys have done any sort of analysis if one particular segment would benefit more than the other in terms of logic, NAND or foundry?","Gary Dickerson","I think relative to AI, as I mentioned earlier, you see announcements almost every week of new logic AI chips going to the physical limits of the reticle field, so the physical limits or the ability of the semiconductor companies to build those chips. So a tremendous amount of transistors, vias, interconnect technology, all of that is in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. Our Transistor and Interconnect Group, all of those different products, epi, PVD, CMP, thermal processing, implant, are really unique and very strong positions for Applied Materials. So that growth is really exactly aligned with the products that we have in logic and in foundry and give us really a great growth opportunity.","The other part of it's the materials enables memory scaling. More and more you're seeing devices going from 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. And as they're going to 3 dimensions, really, the ability to scale the performance and also the cost is all about new materials, new deposition, epi, new etch technology, selective removal, all of those areas. And personally, I'm increasingly optimistic that we have very innovative, highly differentiated new technologies that will not only enable further scaling in 3D NAND technology, but also enable new memory technologies. Our position there is very, very strong. The relationships and the engagements that we have with customers are broader and deeper than we've ever had in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citi.","Atif Malik","I have a question on the display part. So at the Analyst Day last year, you guys talked about expanding the TAM on the display products from 15% to 30%, 40% over the next 2 years. Just curious, how are your engagements going with those new display products so far?","Gary Dickerson","So we have very broad and deep relationships with all the leading companies in display and also the leading consumer electronics companies that are using those displays. So we're in a really great position to enable these new technologies. And as customers are moving forward with new display technology, it increases our total available market and puts us in a good position to continue to grow that business. If you look at display overall, you really have 2 big drivers. One is the strong organic LED for mobile opportunity and that is a broadening out to a large number of customers and also, the increased adoption of larger TV screens. So both of those are driving our business. As I said earlier, we have very strong and deep relationships with leading customers and we're focused on the biggest technology challenges. If you look at all of those customers that want to get into the growing mobile OLED market, we're focused on the major technology challenges that enable those customers to build those kinds of devices. We're not ready to announce any specific opportunities at this point in time but we will later this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sreekrishnan Sankar","The question I had was WFE running at 40 billion, 40 plus billion this year and next year, where do you think 3D NAND WFE is within that? And if the prices for NAND roll over, the reality of economics kick in and 3D NAND makers scale back the CapEx. Or do you think demand is strong enough to continue investing in capacity for the next 2 to 4 years?","Robert Halliday","Sure. So the question was, is 3D NAND going to keep expanding? Is that -- yes. So let me take a shot at that. So 3D NAND spending is up this year. It was up again last year. If you look at it, there's about 1.6 million wafer starts in the world of 3D NAND -- NAND in total. By the end of this year, they will convert at 750,000 wafer starts per month. So there's still a fair amount that's going to convert. I think that the vast majority that's going to convert over time because 3D performs better than 2D. I think what also helps memory in general, particularly NAND, is that more and more customers' customers are starting swap out 3D NAND over time for hard disk drives. So overall, demand for memory is going up. The share of NAND, far versus how this drive will trend up and 3D will be the NAND of choice versus 2D. So they're early in the build-out, 750,000. They got to get to 1.6 million. And we think that the installed capacity is going to go up over time because of this demand. Then if you look at greenfield versus refresh, we're kind of agnostic, frankly. So if you look at the cost of doing a greenfield 3D NAND factory, we do well. In fact, we're gaining share at virtually every product, I believe. If you look at transition of one 3D to a higher level of 3D, the revenue opportunity for us is about the same.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Chin of UBS.","Stephen Chin","Just a follow-up question on the higher outlook for wafer fab equipment spending. What customer type is driving that big increase in your WFE? And do you think this $40 billion number is the new normalized level for WFE and not a peak?","Robert Halliday","Yes, it was seen across the board. We're seeing it at NAND, DRAM and foundry. Logic's kind of flattish. We're seeing it at almost every customer, I think, too. So it's very broad. And when you get that broad, it's not, hey, they're timing DRAM, they're putting more DRAM in a PC. The root cause is broader than that because it's across a wide range of device types of customers. So then you say, what is the application for driving? We do think it's more and more about more applications for your PC and your data center and stuff like that. So it does start to see these AI stuff, deep learning. Can I point exactly how much does AI I know? But it's across the board we're seeing this, right? So then in terms of the number, those are, I called earlier, I think this year begins with a 4. But I'm not saying it's 40, frankly. It's a good number and I think next year's a good number. So I actually think the new normal is 40 plus. I think what I worry about internally at the company, that we don't plan more for the upside than downside. I think there's more opportunity on the upside than the downside.","Gary Dickerson","One thing I'd add to that is that I think everybody is seeing a large increase in the amount of data and also the value of the data. If you look at deep learning, the amount of data that you process is going to go up. Right now, a lot of data's thrown away. So you've got an increase in the amount of data and then the amount of data that's processed is also going to increase. So both of those factors make me personally pretty bullish about the memory business long term. And certainly, that's also what we're hearing from our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura.","Romit Shah","I did notice that display revenues were a little light in the quarter and that margins were down about 5 points. Can you talk about that, Bob? Is that just short term noise? And last quarter, you gave a target for display. I think it was up -- for 2017, up 50%. Do you still feel good about that?","Robert Halliday","Yes, we do. It's just timing and it's just logistical. Display's going to have a really good year. The underlying market dynamics are very strong for both TVs and mobile. And our position's really good. So I think display is strongly a lot of opportunity. And then we have a product cycle we've discussed coming on board later in the year. So I'm bullish on display and I think I wouldn't read too much in these quarterly numbers. In terms of the numbers we set last quarter, yes, we'll hit those. Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Bob, I had a question on gross margins. You guys showed nice upside in the quarter. And just wondering what the drivers were here. In the past, I think you pointed to outsized growth and things like etch and display that were headwinds to the business. The recent improvement, is that a function of that headwind abating? Or is that a combination of mix shift and also fundamental and sustainable improvement across the board?","Robert Halliday","Yes. If you look at a company like Applied, the gross margin improvement or change is a function primarily of 2 things and one third thing that's a little smaller. One is execution and second is mix and the third which is a little smaller, is absorption with volume, right? So if you look at execution, that's really three things, how you're executing cost reduction; how you're executing on new product development; and how you're executing in terms of field execution. So if you go look at it, this year, we're up a lot. We're up over a couple -- I don't know, several points. And if you look at it, I would say that the improvement -- we have underlying improved execution. So this year, we're up about almost, what, 3 points? So if you look at it this year, execution is trending up and that'll continue on for a while. I think every year, we'll get better. ","Now we're benefiting from pretty good mix shifts. It's been a good year for our products in the TIG family, PVD, epi, things like that. And so it's helped a little bit. And absorption's helped a little bit this year. It's a pretty big year. It's over 40 and we're gaining share. But I would say that the overall gross margin performance of the company will trend up over time, but this year was helped a little bit by volume and by mix. But I would say I'm still positively upward bound on margins. So if you go -- if we have to redo a model in Analyst Day, I'd probably lean in on a higher WFE and higher margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore","I wanted to follow up on some of the questions on the upward revision in WFE, particularly with regards to memory. We look at sort of memory cash flows and make some assumptions that there's just an algorithmic percentage of that peak cash flow that gets spent which is probably more negative than what you guys are describing that there are sort of people who are looking at the current situation and deciding that they need more supply. I mean, I guess it's more semantics, I guess. But how do you characterize when you see the upward revision that we've seen in just a 6-month window? How much of that is just because prices are better, companies have cash flow and they use it to improve their competitive position versus something that's more sort of structural and dynamic? How do you interpret it as more structural aspect versus just better pricing?","Robert Halliday","We look at a few things. Yes, we dug into this ourselves, too. We looked at what's driving this data. We looked at some cosmic data. So we looked at the stuff like how much data is captured out there. And we capture -- it was like 8 zettabytes of data was captured in 2016, I think, close to 25 zettabytes of data in 2020 and then it goes to like 45 zettabytes of data. So more and more data has been captured. It's gone up a lot, even in your homes, your cars, your industry, your companies. Then we look at the transmission, processing, source of that data we talked about. So when we start to look at root causes, we've seen a lot of this stuff, right? So then you go look at what's going on more close to planet Earth. And so we looked at this and we said, well, what's going on with NAND and DRAM? We split them up. DRAM's up but it's the still not through the roof. It's pretty good but still kind of restrained because a fair amount of this budget's being spent on NAND. So DRAM price is good. NAND price is good.","Supply and demand's okay. So the DRAM, I would say, has probably gotten a little more upside than downside, frankly, in '18 because this year it hasn't been through the roof. It's up from what we thought earlier in the year. And then if you look at NAND, they're selling all the 3D NAND they can build. So it's still pretty good and I do think it goes to these longer term trends they have at NAND. So then if you look at the -- the final thing is just, well, how come you guys are low early in the year? And I think it goes to 2 root causes which, frankly, inflict all of us. One is I think we're a little bit a prisoner of past thinking. So okay, it can only go so high. But it goes to what Gary said earlier. There's different fundamental demand drivers at a simple level. It was, hey, use PCs. Then we agreed, okay, in 2010, mobile's coming in. And then -- but now you had all this big data stuff in content which is going up. That's what's really up last year. So it's content in the phones, content in the data centers, right? And so when you start to look, what were we inflicted with? We were saying, oh, we're going to roll over. But maybe there's real demand drivers here, number one. And number two, sometimes we listen too closely to our customers on a tactical basis. ","They have to give us good demand forecast for kind of 6 months out so we could build the tools. Beyond that 6 months, maybe they're a little conservative to what they say to us for various reasons. So I think there are tactical reasons why we're a little too conservative. And I think that will -- data that shows it's not overbought now and there are longer term reasons that make you think this is very sustainable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel.","Patrick Ho","Gary or Bob, in terms of the display business for you guys, we do see the longer term trends of OLED. Can you give a little bit of qualitative commentary on the LCD side of things, how you're benefiting this year as TV sizes do grow larger? Is this also one of those sustainable trends? Or is this just going to be a 1-year or 1.5-year phenomenon as the industry transitions on that front?","Robert Halliday","Yes, I'll start and Gary can jump in. Gary's TV aging is a little obsolete at his home base, but I'll start. So if you go look at this year, we're going to be strong in both TVs and mobile. TV's largely LCD. Mobile is -- the spending is largely for OLED, okay? So if you look at the 2 drivers, in OLED, it's conversion of the phones which we've talked about. My estimate is likely early in '18, about 37%, 38% of the phones, there'll be capacity to make them OLED even though the demand is there. We think it will be about 55%, as we said earlier in kind of 2020. I think it is 67%, 2021. So really, OLED phone displays is kind of supply constrained, to be honest with you. So that's very sustainable. I think it will keep going up beyond 67% is my opinion, too, in 2021.","I remember everything, we got backlog kind of ships 6 to 9 months later. So you have extra length on the revenue. Then if you go to TVs, what's really driving the TVs is the big TVs. So we said at Analyst Day that through 2020, I think it was, we're tracking 7 Gen 10.5 fabs. We're now up to 9. And so -- and those [indiscernible] is just starting to ship, okay? And those fabs, on average, spend more than a Gen 8.5. I think there's been about $2.2 billion where it's like $1.2 billion, I think, on a Gen 8.5. So this big TV stuff's got legs for a while. And the capital intensity for these bigger fabs is good and our position's real good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg","You mentioned earlier on the call regarding bit density and 3D NAND from generation to generation being slower than the planar NAND conversion. So just wondering, could you give us an idea on how much more fab capacity might be needed annually to drive, say, 40% bit growth and what the incremental opportunity can be for AMAT?","Robert Halliday","Sure. Some of this goes to what I said earlier. So we see and I think we're a little bit on the low side sometimes, that NAND bit growth is going to be probably in the high 30s or something like that. Now last year was much higher. If you look at content in phones, it was up like -- the data we got from an outside service provider was 57%. So there are indications that we're on the low side on some of these things. Plus we're not sure we've captured all the movement to hard disk drives. So I'd say I'm more on the over camp in that number than the under. So then if you go look at it, as I said earlier, the 750,000 wafer starts by the end of this year, we think that they're going to have to continue to spend in dollars WFE content similar to this year for a number of years. Now if they spend on greenfield or they spend on conversions, we're kind of agnostic from a revenue point of view. But we think the total spending is similar to this year for a number of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Ellis of B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","I wanted to follow up on the comments that you had, Bob, that there were some project-related R&D spending in the outlooks numbers. The question is to what extent is that more of a near term micro opportunity that the company is using versus something that may be more longer term and structural, either because you're viewing the market opportunity differently over the next few years and are chasing some additional existing SAM or as you look at different opportunities, chasing some new SAM that's emerged over the last 3 to 6 months?","Robert Halliday","Yes. I think increasing the R&D spend was a wise decision, frankly. I think that when we showed you the model -- if you go back to 2013 when I first got here, we showed the first model. Our base case model was kind of a $30 billion base case. And then we did a $33.5 billion. Last year, it was $34.5 billion, I think. If I had to do a base case model for the industry, it's probably -- it's going to be north of that. I don't want to presell Analyst Day in September, but it's obviously north of that. The second thing is our position's a lot stronger. We used to be 18% of WFE and I think last year, we were like 22% or something. We're still going up. Our model is to hit the 25.5%. ","We're comfortable with that. So if you look at Applied and then display, the magnitude of the change is big or bigger. It was an $8 billion spending environment when we set up and now it's kind of twice that. Our product pipeline is good. So I think the wise decision is to continue to invest in the opportunities. Now customers are coming to us more and more because we've become even more innovative than we were. So if you look at the range of products we're doing, the innovation in terms of the pipeline, really good. So we're getting lots of pull from customers to develop new products. They're taking more and more demo tools from us. We're getting more and more applications. So I think it's money well spent. I think it'll probably trend up. If you look at the model, probably a little bit of risk that the OpEx is higher than the model, but OpEx as a percentage of sales is down 10 points from 2013 by the end of this year. If you look at operating margins, they're up significantly and will probably beat the model. The upside's lower than the downside on the revenue gross margin, operating margins in the model.","Gary Dickerson","In terms of where we're focused, the strategy for us has been inflection-focused innovation. There are really big inflections that are happening at 10- and 7-nanometer. When you're building these AI chips that are as big as the physical limits, there are a lot of technology challenges. We talked about PVD growing this last year to enable the interconnect -- new interconnect technology for lower-power devices. You've got high-performance memory chips also where the PVD is growing for us. And in the -- and the memory area, the ability to scale 3D NAND, is there's big technical challenges there for our customers. And it's really all about etch, deposition. We've got very innovative new materials. The etch area, we've grown our market share significantly over the last few years. Great products, some of the best products I've ever seen in my life. Sym3 is the fastest-growing product in the history of the company.","The Selectra product, where we have 1,000 to 1 selectivity. These are enabling customers to build devices that were never possible before and build them in different ways, scale these new technologies, build the logic devices at the physical limits or -- and the same thing is true in display. For organic LED mobile displays, there are technology challenges that are facing customers that want to ramp new factories for those new types of devices. So for me, personally, we've -- I look at Applied Materials, our competencies, technologies, talent is really unbelievable and sets us apart from any other company. And we're really in a sweet spot of all of these major inflections. So we've certainly moved a lot of money within the company over the last few years. The OpEx as a percentage of revenue has been going done. But we're going to invest to enable these inflections and drive sustainable growth for the company. The opportunities for us have never been better.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham.","Edwin Mok","Just want to circle back on China. You guys mentioned expect a pretty significant pickup in spending in China in 2018. Maybe if I -- we focus on the memory side. We've seen like some of these customer announce pretty aggressive road map for the 3D NAND technology. Just wondering, is this bigger spending in '18 predicated on those customer hitting those targets or rolling out those devices and if they have issues going on with the devices that delay the spending that you expect in '18?","Gary Dickerson","We have a range of forecast for China. So as I said earlier, it's one of our strongest regions in both semiconductor and display. We have very, very deep relationships with many of these customers. Right now, what we believe for 2018 is that the business will be up meaningfully from 2017. But frankly, that's also at the most likely and low risk end of the forecast. There's a higher range there that would be going up at a much faster pace. We're looking at early indicators for all of those new projects, but I think right now, we're pretty confident that the increase in China in 2018 will happen. Maybe it's $1 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of total wafer fab equipment. So that we have pretty high confidence in terms of the engagements or the information we're getting from all of those customers. There is upside potential, but that's our current view.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank.","Shek Ho","Going back to the question on capital returns, your free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has come up quite a bit over the past 5 years. I think it was averaging like 15% and now it was more like 20%-plus. Your dividend yield has come down quite a bit as well just because your stock has done so well. But with the long term debt you raised recently, I know you explained that earlier in the call, but just curious, are there any changes to your philosophy in capital returns? I guess specifically, why not raise your dividend and maybe spend a little less on buybacks and -- given dividend hasn't gone up for a number of years? Or are you saving some dry powder for future M&A?","Robert Halliday","I think we'll probably -- I think we'll continue to return -- the total of all cash to investors will be very, very healthy. I think that the mix will probably morph over time through dividends. We haven't made a firm commitment but I think it will happen. I think the 2 things that I'm kind of watching is, one, I think I'd like to see tax policy because dividend's a firm, fixed commitment. As soon as you make it, then you got to hit it every quarter. And you really have to lean into where you're going to end up, what's your end stake, because people look at the yield, not with -- did you raise it $0.02 a quarter. So we have to commit to a dividend increase over time that gets to effective yield. And with the stock going up, that cash commitment has gone up. So I'm willing to do that, but I'd like to see clarity on the tax policy before I make that fixed commitment to an increasing yield.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Sydney, for the question. And Latiff, time check. I just want to see if there's anyone in the queue still.","Operator","Yes, sir, we do have one more question in queue.","Michael Sullivan","Okay. Thank you. We'll take that question and then we'll bring it back to me. Thanks.","Operator","That question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","You guys talked a lot about some of the trends driving logic and foundry, AI, deep learning, VR, data center. And it's interesting because these drivers have some of the biggest chip sizes in the industry, right? In videos, the latest deep learning chip has 18 billion transistors on a single piece of silicon. Broadcom's latest data center switching chip has like 7 billion transistors. These are huge chips, right? My point is that each of these units is consuming more silicon but they're also requiring more leading-edge complex manufacturing. So this is great for capital intensity trends. It's great for equipment business. But frankly, it's a nightmare from a yield perspective. So help us understand the trends you're seeing in your metrology and inspection business and how you guys are helping your customers improve yields. You guys gained share in this segment last year. How do you think this segment grows relative to your overall semi systems business this year?","Gary Dickerson","Okay. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Yes. Again, on the large logic chips that you talked about, we actually had the NVIDIA CEO here just a few months ago. And one of the questions was, really, what does all of this mean to us? And he talked about physical, the chip's as big as they can physically build them. And actually, he also said, a million times more memory. So all of those things are obviously positive for Applied Materials. In inspection share, we're -- or inspection business, we're growing significant amount. We had record revenue in '16. We're on track for record revenue in '17. And if you look at our e-beam business which is our largest part of PDC which includes e-beam inspection, e-beam review and CD-SEM, we're going to be up in '17 more than 50% versus '15. We have very, very strong technology position with world-class electron optics and very strong customer pull for e-beam products in logic, foundry and repeat orders for the PROVision in memory with some large customers. So very, very strong position. We have great technology, very strong customer pull and we believe that we're going to continue the growth that we've seen over the last couple of years in our PDC business.","Michael Sullivan","Great. Well, thanks, Harlan, for the question. And Bob, would you like to add anything else before we close the call?","Robert Halliday","Sure. Thanks, Mike. One of Gary's favorite expressions around here is innovation's about connecting the dots. Let me see if I connect a few dots that I -- we believe and I hope you heard today. One, we believe the wafer fab equipment market is sustainably higher and less volatile. Also, display is higher and for Applied, it's sustainably a better market because there are more technology inflections and because we're growing our served market. Second, Applied's position in the market is sustainably stronger. And we're executing better and better. And third, we're generating more free cash flow and returning the excess to our shareholders.","Speaking of free cash flow, one of your own interesting note comparing Applied Materials to some of the top names in the industrial sector. Relative to the average of the companies, Applied has higher revenue and profit growth along with higher ROIC and free cash flow margins. Compared to these companies, I believe we're being discounted for being more cyclical even as we become demonstrably less cyclical. I believe that over time, we'll be viewed and valued in a new way. So thank you for your time today. And we look forward to seeing many of you in person over the next few weeks.","Michael Sullivan","Well, great. Thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. A replay of the call is going to be available on the website beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, you may disconnect your lines at this time.

Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and answer-session.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Good afternoon. We appreciate you joining us for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied's current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC.","All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of November 15, 2018, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at AppliedMaterials.com.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary Dickerson","Thanks, Mike. In our fourth fiscal quarter, Applied Materials posted solid results, in line with our guidance. Despite challenging market conditions in the second half of the year, each of our major businesses delivered double-digit growth in fiscal 2018. This would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees around the world. And I would like to thank them for all their contributions over the past year.","While we expect market headwinds to continue in the near term, we're not seeing the large fluctuations that characterized the semiconductor and display equipment industries in the past. At the same time, we are demonstrating that we have built a more resilient company with diversified revenue streams that can execute well in a range of market conditions.","Looking further ahead, we are confident that longer term growth drivers in both semiconductor and display remain firmly in place and will continue to create great opportunities for Applied. During the call today, I'll start with our perspective on near term market dynamics. Then I'll summarize Applied's performance and priorities, and finish by talking about the future growth drivers reshaping our industry, and describing the company's strategy and investments to address the evolving needs of our customers, and the substantial opportunities ahead.","Over the past several years, I've shared my perspective that the wafer fab equipment industry has fundamentally changed. Today, it is structurally larger and less volatile than it was in the past. These changes are due to increasingly diverse market drivers, spanning consumer, enterprise and industrial applications.","In recent months, however, we've seen several factors negatively impacting industry spending. These include elevated macroeconomic risks, global trade tensions and specific to our industry, a pullback in memory investments. Recent commentary by memory makers has painted a consistent picture. Overall demand in the server, PC and mobile markets is weaker than it was earlier in the year and memory prices are softening in the near term.","Our customers tell us they expect demand to pick up and pricing to stabilize in the second half of 2019. I believe the pullback in memory spending we're going through today is different from the down cycles of the past. There were several reasons for this. Supply and demand are relatively well balanced. Customers' investments in capacity are rational and disciplined. And the overall economics of the memory industry remain healthy.","In foundry and logic, overall spending levels are strong, as customers optimize capacity at the current nodes, while concurrently pushing forward the leading edge. After a long time in development, the first EUV tools are expected to enter volume production in 2019. To support the initial adoption of EUV, we are seeing additional investments in these long lead-time systems in 2018 and 2019, creating share headwinds for Applied during this period.","In aggregate, even with the current challenges I've just described, overall wafer-fab equipment spending remains at consistently high levels. We still believe that 2018 and 2019 combined spending will be around $100 billion. Relative to our prior view, we now see 2018 as slightly higher than 2019.","While we are cognizant of macroeconomic and global trade factors, our long-term perspective on major technology trends is unchanged. Fundamental growth drivers are firmly in place as more industries are becoming increasingly dependent on technology, data, and specifically, silicon to define their futures.","One of the things that distinguishes Applied from our peers is our broad technology base and the diversity of our products. This provides us with a platform for future growth and the flexibility to deliver solid financial performance in a variety of market conditions. Although our first fiscal quarter will be down sequentially and year-on-year, we will deliver performance that is approximately equivalent to our average quarterly run rate in 2017, when spending patterns were much more favorable for Applied.","This is because we've been building out our product portfolio to better address major technology inflections. For example, we significantly improved our position in memory, adding nearly 10 points of market share in the past 5 years. At the same time, we've scaled our service business at a 15% compound annual growth rate over the past 4 years with plenty of headroom for further expansion.","Additionally, we've grown our display business at more than 25% compound annual growth over the past 6 years. While our display growth trajectory may not be linear, and as we've previously stated, revenues could be down around 20% in 2019. I feel very good about our future opportunities. Across the company, we're taking a long-term perspective and we continue to prioritize our spending towards R&D, to enable major technology inflections for our customers and drive our long-term growth strategy.","I strongly believe that over the next decade A.I. and Big Data will transform almost every sector of the economy, and at the foundation of those changes are electronics and semiconductors. Enabling this A.I.-Big Data future will require new types of computing at the Edge and in the Cloud, lower cost lower powered chips and abundant storage.","As classic Moore's Law scaling slows down, the semiconductor industry's traditional playbook is not providing the necessary improvements in power, performance, area and cost. As a result, a new playbook is needed, which includes the development of entirely new chip architectures, new 3D structures within the chip, the integration of new exotic materials, new ways to shrink feature geometries, including EUV lithography and self-aligned patterning, and advanced packaging techniques to connect chips together in new ways.","All five of these areas require major advances in materials engineering and create a wealth of opportunity for Applied. As a result, we are evolving our strategy and making investments to position the company to play a larger and more valuable role in the A.I.-Big Data era.","We are creating new and unique capabilities for the industry and developing entirely new types of products. Earlier today, we announced plans for our new materials engineering technology accelerator or META Center, which is expected to open in 2019 in New York. The META Center will extend the capabilities of our Mayden Technology Center in Silicon Valley to address the ecosystems growing need to accelerate innovation from materials to systems.","This expansion of our R&D infrastructure will allow us to work with system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community in new ways. It's designed to support new types of collaboration from early prototyping to rapid transfer of new technologies from lab to fab.","We're already seeing strong pull for earlier and deeper customer engagements, especially for new integrated materials solutions, where we can combine multiple processes together, often within a single system. We are bringing together our broad portfolio of technologies and our ability to understand the interaction between materials creation, materials removal and materials modification to address our customer's increasingly complex integration challenges. I am excited about the value we can create at current, future and trailing nodes.","Before I hand the call over to Dan, let me quickly summarize. While the industry is navigating near-term headwinds, spending remains robust. We believe this demonstrates that wafer fab equipment is structurally larger and less cyclical than in the past. Although the current spending patterns within wafer fab equipment do not play to Applied\u2019s strengths, we are still delivering strong financial performance, thanks to the breadth of our product portfolio.","We remain focused on positioning the company for the long-term, expanding our role in the A.I.-Big Data era and winning the major technology inflections ahead.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Durn","Thanks, Gary. I'd also like to thank the teams for delivering record revenue and operating profit in fiscal 2018. Today, I'll share my perspective on our industry outlook then summarize our Q4 financial results, provide our Q1 business outlook and discuss the growth investments we're making in upstate New York.","As Gary said, overall industry demand is weaker today than in the first half of 2018 and we expect our first quarter results to be lower sequentially. Our guidance includes the impact of a recent export restriction. Without this, we would have guided our semiconductor revenue to be higher sequentially. While we're not ready to call the bottom of the current cycle, we are optimistic that we're not going to see the same kind of volatility we saw in the past, as an industry or as a company.","Our semi equipment guidance for Q1 implies annualized WFE in the mid-$40 billion range. It's important to note that this is about $10 billion higher than in all of the years prior to the current cycle. And it reinforces our positive industry thesis, which is based on three core beliefs. First, we see a large market for PCs and mobile devices plus the emergence of a big wave of new demand drivers related to A.I. and Big Data.","Second, we believe that after a long downtrend, the capital equipment intensity has stabilized. And third, our customers are more profitable and taking proactive steps to keep supply and demand in balance. We believe the industry is more attractive and the company is more attractive. Over the past six years Applied has built a bigger, more diverse, more resilient business. In fact, in both 2017 and 2018, we delivered more than twice the operating profit of any other year in the past decade.","Looking forward to 2019, our customers point to an improving demand outlook in the second half of the year, even if the shape of the recovery off of our Q1 guidance is shallower and more gradual. We believe we will generate higher earnings this fiscal year than in 2017. Our improved profitability enables us to continue making disciplined investments in our future growth opportunities, while simultaneously delivering attractive cash returns to shareholders.","Now I'll summarize our Q4 results. We delivered revenue and non-GAAP gross margin that was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. We held non-GAAP OpEx below the midpoint and generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.97 just above the midpoint.","Turning to the segments, Semiconductor Systems revenue declined by about 5% year-over-year and was slightly below our expectation. Non-GAAP operating margin declined to 29.6%. Our Global Services business revenue grew by 18% year-over-year to $977 million and non-GAAP operating margin increased to 29.7%. Our Display group delivered $702 million in revenue, which was slightly above our target. Non-GAAP operating margin remained high at 29.3%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Operating cash flow improved to 27% or nearly $1.1 billion. We returned $946 million to shareholders, including $751 million in buybacks. We ended the period with $5.6 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, and $4.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. We enter fiscal 2019 with a strong backlog of over $6 billion.","Next, I'll provide our Q1 guidance. We expect company revenue to be between $3.56 billion and $3.86 billion. Within the outlook, we expect silicon systems revenue to be down by about 21% year-over-year. Services revenue should be up by about 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, Q1 of 2018 was exceptionally strong for our services business with revenue up 30% over Q1 2017. Our Display revenue should be up by about 10% year-over-year.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin of around 44.6% and non-GAAP OpEx of around $750 million plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP earnings should be in the range of $0.75 to $0.83 per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate expectation is approximately 12%. As a reminder, this is up nearly 6 points when compared to last year's rate.","Now I'll close by discussing the investments we're making in New York. Earlier today, Applied and the state announced plans to create one of the most advanced R&D centers in the world. The META Center will pioneer the materials, process technologies and architectures our customers will need to overcome the industry's scaling challenges.","Applied is committed to investing $600 million over the first seven years of the agreement, including both cash and in-kind contributions. Our planned investments will not raise the operating expense targets in our longer term financial model. New York State will invest $250 million to purchase and install tools and equipment.","State funding of the META Center is subject to a variety of approvals. And we expect to secure public funding by the end of this calendar year. We intend to ramp up our activities in calendar 2019 and target pilot production in the second half of the year. The META Center will dramatically expand our capacity to collaborate with our customers to accelerate breakthroughs in semiconductor power, performance and cost.","Now, Mike, let's begin with Q&A.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Dan. Now, to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please pull the operator and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Please go ahead.","C.J. Muse","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question in terms of market share and positioning. So you talked about EUV as a likely headwind into 2019, but also investments you're making in terms of technological inflection. So, curious, can you kind of walk through the timing where we could see a resumption of share gains on the WFE side?","And also, as you think about mix in 2019, does that allow you to perhaps at least grow in line? Would love to hear your thoughts, I guess, both 2019 as well as inflections beyond that. Thank you.","Gary Dickerson","Yeah, thanks for the question C.J. Let me give you some color on market share. And I think it's useful to think about three timeframes, what we've done, what we see today and where we're going. When I joined Applied in 2012, we substantially shifted investment towards big inflections. As a result in the 6 years to 2017, we held or increased share for 6 consecutive years.","I think we were up five years and flat one. And also, we increased share in memory, where we had a big focus. So we increased our total share of memory spending by about 10 points. So in the near term, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, 2018 we're gaining or holding share in the vast majority of our businesses, but we also see rapid growth in EUV and also in other markets where we don't compete. So as a result, we do expect our share to decline in 2018.","After many years of development, we expect to see the first EUV tools used in production beginning in 2019. Those tools have very long lead times and to support the initial adoption, we expect high spending in 2018 and 2019, creating a mix headwind for our overall WFE share.","Of course, those long lead-time shipments also are a positive indicator for our future business. And another thing you talked C.J. about mix and other important near-term factor to think about is 3D NAND spending. Once that recovers, the mix will become a lot more favorable for us. And then over - the last thing is over the longer term, over the last couple of months I've spent time with many customers, and still believe that the industry needs a new playbook beyond 2D scaling. And I deeply believe that Applied is in the best position to enable this new playbook. I heard this from all of the customers I met over the last couple of months. And we've all seen classic Moore's Law scaling slowing. All the customers in the industry want more ways to drive PPAC, power, performance, area and cost.","So as we've communicated before, we're driving a new playbook that includes five different techniques that I've been talking about, including developing entirely new chip architectures, new 3D structures within the chip, the integration of new materials, new ways to shrink including EUV and self-aligned patterning, and advanced packaging techniques to connect chips together in new ways. All five of those areas require major advances in materials engineering and create great growth opportunities for Applied.","As a result of that, we're creating new and unique capabilities for the industry, investing in the META Center to accelerate materials to systems, where there's tremendous value and developing entirely new types of products that move the needle for our customers and for Applied.","Dan Durn","And it's fair to say the mix is hard to predict right now, C.J. So it will depend on what happens in 2019, 2020 in terms of things like 3D NAND like Gary said. So I think we'll stay tuned on trying to make that prediction this early in the year. Thanks.","C.J. Muse","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Atif Malik from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Atif Malik","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, I have a question for you on display. Can you talk about the puts and takes for your down 20% display outlook next year? We hear LG and Samsung ramping and converting capacity on Gen 8 OLED TVs with some weakness on the flexible Gen 6 lines.","Also, you guys launched a couple of new products at OLED World Summit, where e-beam, CD metrology and e-beam [indiscernible], so just your thoughts on display market next year?","Gary Dickerson","Thanks for the question, Atif. So happy to give you a color on our display business, as we've said before we've grown display a tremendous amount over the last 6 years, at about 25% compound annual growth rate.","For 2019, we've talked about the business declining in the range of 15% to 20%. And given the elevated risk, I believe we're likely to be at the low end of that range. So then, if you go into the different segments, in the TV segment, I continue to expect our customers will transition to Gen 10.5 technology, because it's strategically important for them to deliver lower costs for large screen TVs.","And as we've previously communicated with Gen 10.5 panels, you can produce 8 65 inch TVs and you only get 3 on a Gen 8.5 panel. So for large screen TVs, it is strategically compelling to move to those larger panel sizes. And recent discussions with customers, we don't see any change in customers' plans.","In the smartphone area, demand is going to be flat year-over-year. But we continue to see OLED is the best technology for the future for a number of different reasons. And we believe that OLED will recover as more suppliers are able to produce at a higher yield. So overall, we see a lot of good opportunities that continue to drive our display business, despite 2019 for the first time in I think 7 years seeing a decline in the business.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Atif.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Pierre Ferragu","Hey, thank you for taking my question. Gary, I have a question for you, a follow-up on your comments about share movements and EUV. And then, I have a quick follow-up for Dan.","So I'm trying to reconcile what you just described and that makes a lot of sense, so EUV is ramping. You're mechanically losing share in that context. But you're expecting to regain share when you bring materials technology that will go along with EUV lithography. But at the same time, in the last few weeks, I heard like TSMC, I mean, reiterating they said, that's for longer, so like a large foundry player that they don't expect CapEx to grow significantly. Then your peer ASML is saying the same.","And so, does that mean you have a different perspective and you think overall CapEx is going to continue to grow in foundry significantly and even grow faster than revenues?","Gary Dickerson","Yeah, thanks for the question. So I think our perspective longer term, Pierre, hasn't changed. And I've spent many, many meetings with customers over the last couple of months. We strongly believe that the industry needs a new playbook. And that, all of those five techniques I talked about earlier are absolutely crucial to deliver power, performance, area and cost needed for this Big Data-A.I. era.","Now, silicon and electronics are going to be at the foundation of all of those major industry transformations, changing in a profound way all the aspects of our life. We still definitely believe that. And if you look at where we need to go with a 1,000 times improvement of performance per watt, you can look certainly at what we've said in the past. You can look at what other people are saying also that they talk about those five areas of focus.","And I deeply believe we're in a better position longer term than we've ever been. Now, certainly there's a headwind in 2018 and 2019. After a long time, you have the initial adoption of long lead-time EUV tools. They'll go into production for the first time in 2019. That's going to certainly provide a headwind for us in the near term, but longer term, I definitely believe the industry is not going to get where we need to go with doing what we've done in the past.","I think it's also very clear with Moore's Law - classic Moore's Law slowing down that you have to drive this new playbook and there is tremendous value in going from materials to systems at a much faster rate. And again, everything I've heard in meetings with customers over the last couple of months, totally reiterates that that's the right strategy. And so that's my thought.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Pierre. And I think, Pierre, you said you might have had a follow-up for Dan. I don't know if you still do, just checking. Okay, hearing no response. Let's move on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar","Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Gary, it looks like the general view that next year the mix of WFE is going to skew more towards foundry and logic versus memory. In that scenario, is it fair to assume that your profitability profile or your margin profile should be better selling into foundry, logic versus memory? And then a quick housekeeping for Dan. What's the impact from export control on Fujian? Was it about $100 million for you guys? Thank you.","Dan Durn","Thanks, Krish. Let me share with you a little bit of what we're seeing around the WFE market and then come to the profitability - the implications that, that has for the profitability of the company. So in the prepared comments, we talked about 2018 and 2019 combined being around $100 billion. I would say, given the elevated risk profile of the environment, we find ourselves in, that's - our expectations around 2019 have probably softened in the last three months. We now see 2019 below 2018.","If I were to - and I think it's premature to be point specific on either 2018, 2019 or the device types. But again, to just share a little bit of what we're thinking to help shape a view of the market. 2019 feels more like 2017 than it does 2018. And if I look at where we sit today in 2018 WFE, all-time high, in terms of aggregate spend and strength across each of the four device types.","And as I profile off of that view into 2019, we would expect memory to be down and foundry, logic to be up. And then if I were to rank order the four device types as we look into 2019, given everything we see today, foundry would be the strongest, then followed by logic, then followed by DRAM, then followed by NAND.","In terms of profitability, I think the best way to think about our business is less about end market profiling the four device types and more about the mix amongst our businesses, the more of our leadership businesses and equipment that we sell, you'll see that be a favorable segment mix - or a favorable product mix within the segment. The less leadership businesses - or the less leadership products we sell, will certainly be a headwind from a margin perspective. So I'd look at it more as a product mix influenced as opposed to end markets.","Gary Dickerson","Yeah. Okay. And then the other part of the question was around this recent action that was directed by a particular Chinese customer. From what we see today, this feels like business as usual for the other customers in the region. And then regarding the geopolitical situation, we certainly believe in fair trade. And we think it's important for the overall ecosystem to have a constructive relationship between the U.S. and China. We can't speculate on any other actions that could take place. And, of course, we continuously monitor the situation and we're going to respond appropriately. And then, Dan, do you want to give color on the magnitude of the impact?","Dan Durn","Sure, Gary. So as we think about our guide into Q1 and we think about the export action that was taken against the one specific customer, we - a quarter ago we're expecting our semi business to be flat to up sequentially. We guided down a bit. In the absence of this export restriction, we would have been up sequentially in our semi systems business into Q1. And I would say that our revenue with that one customer in Q1 is a meaningful number.","So the EPS guidance we provided into Q1 reflects a significant reduction in semiconductor revenue along with an unfavorable mix within the product portfolio. And I think that gives you a sense of the impact of that action on the one customer. I don't think, we want to be more specific, since it's a direct read-through on one customer. But I think that's enough to give you a sense of what the impact to our company was in our fiscal Q1.","Michael Sullivan","All right. Thanks, Krish.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Pitzer","Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Gary, Dan, to the extent in your prepared comments, I think you said you're not prepared to call the January quarter - January guidance a bottom. I'm wondering was that relative to the overall Applied revenue stream, the silicon business? Was that a sequential comment or a year-over-year comment? I guess, specifically with the silicon business, Dan, being down over 20% year-over-year, I believe, relative to your Jan guidance. Do you think that that will represent a year-over-year bottom that we can start to build off of? Or how should we think about that?","Dan Durn","Thanks, John. Let me share with you a little bit of what we're seeing in the market, and hopefully, it helps provide some context and color that gets at the essence of what you're asking about. I would say based on our customer conversations, and the guidance we gave about not calling the bottom is specifically related to our semi business, because I think that's where the biggest question in the market is today. Based on the customer conversations we're having, we think that first half 2019 would likely be higher than second half 2018.","But we also think given the elevated risk profile, we - or the elevated risk environment, we find ourselves in geopolitical trade, handsets industrials being on the weaker side, that certainly offset by decent markets in PC, comm infrastructure, cloud CapEx. But as a package creates an elevated risk profile, we think it's prudent to create an expectation around a shallow, gradual, U-shaped recovery of the semi business into 2019.","And so for a variety of reasons, I don't think we want to put a stake in the ground and call it a definitive bottom. But, we like what we see and are trying to be prudent in expectation setting.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. If you have your phone on mute, please unmute your line.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Despite the equipment, Dan, on this China domestic DRAM that you guys are talking about here in Q1, there are - these two other major programs in China, one in NAND, one in DRAM that are potentially looking to kind of ramp next year. I think, last quarter you guys said that 2019 China domestic was looking more kind of heavily weighted towards foundry, has your view changed in light of some - has your view changed in light of this activity with some of the other memory suppliers that are looking to potentially ramp both NAND and DRAM capabilities, maybe starting second half of next year?","Gary Dickerson","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Yeah, as I said earlier, we don't really see any change in the activities with the other customers in the region. Of course, we're going to continuously monitor that and respond to anything that we need to respond to, but one thing, I may be helpful if I give you color on our China business, how it's composed.","So our Display, we have a large display business in China and a little less than half of our revenue is semi systems, roughly half of that is multinational, the other half is domestic and for domestic, we're fairly balanced between foundry, logic and memory.","And when we look ahead to 2019 and beyond, consistent with what we've said before, we didn't see a hockey stick, in terms of growth in the domestic market and we continue to see modest growth in the semi market going forward. So, I would say, at least today, we don't see any change in behavior with our customers, and that's basically the profile of the different parts of our business, which is pretty consistent with what we've said before.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Harlan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. My question is on services. So services had a pretty strong year in fiscal 2018, looks like it was up about 25% year-on-year and you're guiding it down sequentially a bit for January, if I interpret it your comments correctly. My question is, does the services at some point in fiscal 2019, start to track the performance of SSG in fiscal 2018 and should we be cognizant of that as we model out the quarters of this coming fiscal year?","Dan Durn","Hi, Romit. Thanks for the question. I think the best way to think about services growth, certainly the installed base is an influencer, but it's not a direct read through. So I don't think that business will directly track the following year, what our systems business does the prior year. But there is a growth vector around the installed base, there is a growth vector around the increasing complexity that the industry is facing and the challenges our customers are increasingly asking for help with their drive yields.","And the third is the strategy we have around comprehensive service agreements to get a bit more predictability in the business versus the transactional nature, and so it's a multi-vector approach and strategy to grow in the business. You point out that the company has done a great job executing that strategy, 2018 was a strong year. And our goal will be to grow that, continue to grow that business at a 15% CAGR on a go-forward basis. So it's a business we feel good about, but I don't think you can make a direct read through based on systems in any one year.","Romit Shah","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Gary, if I look longer term, what is your relative exposure to the smartphone market directly, indirectly versus the enterprise or data center, because when I look over the last five years of growth in the semi-cap equipment industry, it kind of coincided with the growth of high-end smartphones. But as they are slowing down, when can the enterprise and data center will be big enough to offset those declines. And do you think it is possible that WFE kind of stays flattish for the next two to three years, because of this dynamic?","Dan Durn","Yeah. Thanks, Vivek. As we take a step back from what drives WFE, if we were to go back a decade in our industry, vast majority of WFE was narrowly focused in and around the PC platform. Since then we've diversified into mobility compute handsets, we've got a lag in the data center, you can see big data cloud service providers beginning to influence that, IoT is playing an increasingly large portions of semiconductor consumption as is - as are things like autonomous driving and Industry 4.0.","It's really hard to disaggregate those long-term technology trends that are increasingly depending on silicon and consuming silicon to a direct read through on WFE, that chain is extremely hard to disaggregate and attribute one to the other.","The second thing I would say is, units in the handsets clearly are slowing down, content gains are still happening, and so we do see favorable trends in that industry. What I like is the broadening of the end market demand drivers that support our industry.","And so as you take a look at how 2017 profile to 2018 and now a quick look into 2019, you can see that our industry is structurally larger, even though the adjustments are headwinds in any given period or quarter are coming from different areas. You can see that, that diversification is serving the industry well, in terms of moderating a bit of the volatility the industry has seen historically.","I would say as we roll the clock forward and we take a point of view on what we think aggregates semiconductor demand is going to be in this world. This is an industry that's $450 billion-ish today. It's going to be $600 billion, $700 billion, $800 billion at some point in the future, manufacturing capacity to produce the wafers and chips that support an industry that sized at those levels. It's going to be a very favorable trend for our industry. So if we were to be sitting here in 2025, talking about a $50 billion WFE, I would be extremely disappointed about that given what we know today.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Vivek.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks so much. Dan, I just had a question about the share repo. I think, you bought back about $3.7 billion over the past six months at quite a bit higher prices than this, but you only bought back $750 million this quarter at much lower prices. So I'm just wondering what the strategy is going forward on the share repo? Thanks so much.","Dan Durn","Yeah. Thanks, Tim. So what we said about our capital allocation strategy is, we're going to focus our excess cash on growing the company, maintaining a strong and healthy balance sheet and then returning excess cash to shareholders. I think what you see is us executing against that strategy. If you narrow the timeframe to any given quarter, the share repurchase may or may not be above where we trade on any given day.","If we take a look at what the company has done over a long period of time in the last two decades, we've given back close to 90% of our free cash flow back to shareholders. Our shares peaked at 1.7 billion shares outstanding; today it's under 1 billion. This is something the company has done for a very long time, not a new policy. And if you look at our three-year track record, the company has given back about $8 billion and we've repurchased almost 20% of the company at an average price of $37. And so I think over the long run, the company has been disciplined and respectful of shareholders in the way in which we manage our free cash flow.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari","Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on your market share comments. You talked about headwinds given the insertion of EUV. But, Gary, do you have any expectations for your positioning in the markets that you do participate in, [etch depth] [ph], CMP, Epi. Is it fair to say that your competitive positioning is still improving in the markets that you actually serve? Thank you.","Gary Dickerson","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Toshiya. We actually, in 2018, were gaining our holding share in the vast majority of our businesses that where we compete today. There are markets that we don't compete and we have initiatives in those areas that where we have very strong pull from customers and we're optimistic that over time that that will provide a significant increase in business for us.","And then, the other thing I would say probably the biggest factor longer term is this new playbook, I mentioned, with the five different drivers, that is really playing to the strengths - uniquely to the strength of Applied Materials with the breadth of our products, all the different materials creation, materials removal, materials modification and also the ability to combine all of these different technologies together in a single platform, where you manage these interfaces that is a really, really, really valuable capability.","I met with all of our large customers in the last two, three months. Many times people running R&D, some of the feedback I was getting was just tremendous. People saying things that they didn't think were possible, relative to power, performance, area and cost.","So those things will not play out in 2018 and not so much in 2019, but really that is the big driver for the industry. This new play book going forward is extremely important. And Applied is in a very unique position to enable those capabilities. So that's why we are investing. That's why we announced the META Center.","And the goal is really to drive materials to systems many times faster than we are at today. We think there's tremendous value there. And, certainly, that's the feedback that we're getting from customers.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Toshiya.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joseph Moore","Great, thank you. My question is on DRAM. I guess, it seems like your DRAM numbers year-to-date have been quite strong in terms of you are sales to DRAM company despite the push-outs that we've seen. And if we aggregate kind of three equipment companies who shift to DRAM there, they are all showing pretty significant strength up in aggregate, I think over 60%.","So, I guess, I understand capital intensity is increasing, but it doesn't seem like it was inflecting that much in any one year. So how is DRAM despite even with push-outs having such a robust year? And, I guess, does that mean supply would accelerate next year? Does it - anything that you would tell us about the sustainability of that into 2019 would be helpful? Thank you.","Dan Durn","Thanks, Joe. As we look at our position in DRAM, it gets back to a bit of the journey that gets us to where we're at from a market share standpoint today. As Gary talked, since he came into the company or when he came into the company, we had one end-market that was over 20% from a market share standpoint. All others were 15% or below.","And the company has done a very good job diversifying across those device types to where we're almost diagnostic across the device types from a market-share standpoint. And DRAM has been one of the beneficiaries. The company's worked really hard with customers to deliver innovation when their roadmaps require it. And it's allowed us to increase our market share with those customers.","We're increasingly seeing in the periphery transistors logic-like processes being adopted to drive I\/O speeds on the devices. And that accrues benefits to us as well in some of our higher market share businesses. And so, the setup around DRAM going forward is a good one for us. It's been good over the last several years.","And as you pointed out, we've done a good job driving market share there. And we like that setup going forward as well. So we like the progress we're making in DRAM.","Gary Dickerson","And then, Joe, if you're looking for the year-over-year in DRAM, we've been planning for it to be sort of into 2019, maybe not quite the 20% that we've seen, maybe it's high teens to 20%. And very good job right now for the customers, doing very proactive supply and demand management, and also a lot of pull for DRAM, especially the high-speed versions in the server market.","So from the customer conversations, it feels pretty good, it feels not as tight as it was. But really proactive steps and it looks like a decent outlook for next year. We think it's still going to be a strong year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Gary, maybe just a follow-up on the playbook, you're talking about with the five key factors in terms of the architecture and the structures within chips and continued materials innovation. Given your strong exposure to the foundry logic segment, do you believe some of these variables would come into play at the 5-nanometer node? Or is this something that, I guess, past 5-nanometers that we will see it more in the next decade?","Gary Dickerson","Patrick, I think, the great thing about many of those drivers, is they're not only for future technology nodes, you can use those in - some of those drivers can make a big difference, move the needle on current devices, and also on trailing geometries, even planar transistors. So that's - and we are seeing strong pull from customers across the board for some of those major drivers at the AI Design Forum in July and at the Electronics Resurgence Initiative, the DARPA Conference in July.","One of the examples we gave was 1,000 times improvement in leakage current. Again, many of these new technologies that we're driving can be used in trailing geometries and even current geometries. So we don't need to wait for the adoption of 3-nanometer or - and, certainly, some of those technologies will be targeted for leading technology nodes, but some of them can be used today.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Patrick. And, operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sidney Ho","Thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to an earlier question on profitability. You guided gross margin at 44.6% and that's quite a bit lower than your fiscal 2020 model, 47%. I understand, it's less about end-market and more about product mix between leadership and growth products. But can you explain what situation will lead you to see higher growth for your leadership products versus growth?","And I would assume first half of 2019 you'll see growth business a little slower because of memory spending, and maybe display revenue is already at lower level. Just trying to think about what's the path for you to get to the fiscal 2020 margin target from here? How much is driven by mix versus volume?","Gary Dickerson","Yeah, thanks, Sidney. Yeah, let me try to unpack that and walk through this systematically. If there's anything I leave out, please follow up. What I would say about gross margins, we've done a good job over the last handful of years. We've increased the gross margin by about 500 basis points, Q4 gross margin in line with our guidance.","And as you know, actual gross margins in any given quarter are going to be a function of several factors. There is revenue level, segment, product mix, customer mix, factory activity. All of those will vary quarter-to-quarter. We are seeing Q1 as part of our guide sequentially lower from a revenue standpoint. AGS continues to be a growing part of the mix.","And we talked about an ERP transition throughout 2018 to risk mitigate customer deliveries at a point of the cycle, where the supply chain was very tight. We kept an elevated level of inventory to make sure our customer needs were covered. We're going to be bringing that factory activity level down over the next three, four quarters to bring that inventory more in line with the natural progression.","And so, clearly there is a number of factors at play. And I guess, the thing I would point to the most is, aggregate revenue level, and then how that revenue profiles across our various products and amongst our segments are going to be the largest influencer to gross margin. Company has done a good job driving those margins historically. I wouldn't look to too much in any one given quarter and we're going to continue to work hard and make progress and continue to drive gross margins off at these levels.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, great. Sidney. Thanks for the question. Dan, before we close the call, anything else you'd like to add, just so we wrap up on time?","Dan Durn","Yeah, thanks, Mike. I guess I want to close with a couple of thoughts. First, we all know that we're in a challenging environment. I think the company has delivered strong results in 2018. But we're definitely not satisfied. We know we still have a lot of work to do and we're going to work aggressively to achieve the goals we set for the company.","I guess the second thing is, is if we fast forward to a year from now, when we look back at our Q1 results, they may prove to be the low point of the year. But we're not ready to call Q1 the bottom until we have collected multiple proof points across a variety of our businesses.","I think if you look at sort of the company's and the way we've engaged in the past, many of you that follow our journey, you know our style is to be transparent. Our goal, our intent is to help you see what we see. As tougher as the environment feels right now, the industry is substantially higher than it was even compared to prior peaks.","We're confident that our long-term thesis around the industry, the long-term technology trends are going to be favorable and they're firmly in place. We also believe we've built the more resilient business. A company that is more profitable. It allows us to invest and uniquely be well positioned to drive the industry inflections that we already see on the horizon.","I guess lastly, finally, look forward to seeing many of you at the Credit Suisse conference in a couple of weeks. Thanks very much.","Michael Sullivan","All right. Thanks, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available on our website by 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. And we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for attending today's conference. This concludes the program, you may all disconnect. Good day."],"2858":["Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) Q4 2014 Earnings Call November 13, 2014  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Michael Sullivan - Vice President of Investor Relations","Gary E.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you, Dustin. Today, we'll discuss the results of our fourth quarter and our 2014 fiscal year, which ended on October 26. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including our current view of the company's industries and our performance, products, strategies, opportunities, announced business combination with Tokyo Electron and business outlook. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied, and they should be interpreted in that light.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.","Gary E. Dickerson","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. In our fourth quarter, Applied Materials delivered revenue and earnings at the midpoint of our target range. This rounds out a strong year for Applied, where we grew sales in our semiconductor business by 25%, and expanded our overall operating margins by 6 points. These results reflect ongoing technology and capacity investments by our semiconductor and display customers, sustainable market share gains in growing markets and significant improvements in our operating performance that we've achieved while increasing investment in new product development.","Our progress towards our strategic and financial goals is made possible by outstanding contributions from our employees around the world. This is a team with tremendous passion to create value for customers and investors.","Over the past 2 years, we have placed Applied on a trajectory of long-term profitable growth and improving financial performance. In 2013, we aligned the business around our precision materials engineering strategy and took steps to shape a more competitive company. We increased our focus on areas that have the biggest impact for customers and generate the best returns for Applied. We shifted spending from low-growth businesses and corporate functions to field resources and product development. We built a stronger organization, bringing in top industry talent, strengthening our business processes for repeatable success and changing our structure to improve alignment and speed. We increased our market share with 1.4 points of overall gains in calendar 2013, and we invested in a pipeline of new products to enable our customers' roadmaps and drive long-term growth for Applied. In 2014, we accelerated this strategy and made strong progress towards our financial model. Our semiconductor business posted the highest revenue since fiscal 2007. And for the calendar year, we expect to gain share or hold share in almost all of our businesses.","We anticipate our largest gains in areas of the market that are growing the fastest. In CVD, we believe we will win at least 3 points of share this year. And in etch, we are on track to deliver almost 2.5x the sales achieved in 2012. These results demonstrate that we have the right strategy and the right team, that we are improving our execution and carrying strong momentum into 2015.","Our merger with Tokyo Electron will enable us to further accelerate this strategy. The detailed plans to bring the 2 companies together are now very well advanced. Our joint integration team is working closely together to make the merger a success, and the progress they've made has far exceeded our expectations.","In terms of the regulatory process, we have been advised to not provide details or answer questions about ongoing discussions. However, I'm pleased to report that the German Competition Authority notified us today that we have received its unconditional approval for the proposed business combination. We are working hard to obtain the remaining approvals as soon as we can. However, we acknowledge that the closing could move into the first quarter of next year.","Turning to our market outlook. Consumer demand for new and better mobile devices with more features and longer battery life remains the primary driver for the semiconductor industry. This is fueling strong foundry investment in leading-edge technology.","Overall, foundry spending in 2014 is on track for 20% to 25% growth year-over-year, and these high spending levels are expected to be sustained in 2015. This year, almost half of the foundry spending was focused on 20 nanometer, and the build-out of this node is nearly complete at the leading customers. 2015 is shaping up to be the year of a FinFET leadership battle, and we anticipate strong investment from our customers as they focus on winning this critical transition.","Memory spending has also been robust in 2014, and we expect higher investment levels next year. NAND bit growth is around 40% this year, driven by increasing bits per box for new mobile devices and strong demand for solid-state storage. The bulk of incremental supply has been provided by advanced planar technology.","In 2015, spending on 3D NAND is expected to be broader and larger, although still not to surpass planar investment until 2016. DRAM investment was stronger than expected at the start of the year, driven by mobile and an enterprise-led PC replacement cycle. DRAM bit growth is around 30%, and with this demand being primarily met by technology conversions. In 2015, we expect supply to remain tight with strong potential for new capacity additions.","Looking at wafer fab equipment as a whole. We maintain that 2014 spending will be up 10% to 20% over 2013. Our current view is that 2015 wafer fab equipment will be higher, driven by the foundry FinFET battle, more customers investing in 3D NAND and increasing DRAM spending.","In addition, over the last 12 months, wafer starts and fab utilization have increased, a trend that we expect to continue in 2015. As the customers aggressively push factory output, we see expanded opportunities for our AGS business. The outlook for the display equipment market also remains very healthy. Attractive price points for 4K TVs are driving a TV refresh cycle, while average screen sizes are growing around twice as fast as historic rates. Demand for higher-resolution, lower-power screens for mobile devices is also a key factor in display, and we are seeing strong LTPS orders for this market. Our quarterly display revenues are at a 3-year high, and we believe we're on track to gain share in our served available market this year.","In both semiconductor and Display, major changes in device technology provide a catalyst for our growth. As we've said before, FinFET and 3D NAND represent the biggest technology transitions in decades. These complex inflections are enabled by materials innovation, and that plays directly to Applied's strengths. They create new precision materials engineering steps, expand our available market and fuel strong demand for our enabling leadership products in transistor and interconnect.","For example, our Epi business posted record sales for the fiscal year. Our metal deposition group delivered its highest annual revenues and operating margins since 2000. And we believe our implant group is on track to reach its highest ever market share.","In logic and memory, the acceleration of materials-enabled scaling is a major driver for etch and deposition. These are large growth opportunities for Applied, where we are building strong momentum and gaining share. We now expect our combined revenues in etch and CVD to grow by almost 50% in calendar 2014.","We see strong customer pull for our next-generation technologies. At SEMICON West, we announced 5 new products that are rapidly gaining traction, and we have now shipped more than 300 of these chambers. We have also been making improvements to our service and spares business to better support customers as they quickly ramp these new device technologies at the right yield and cost. Our service organization is building momentum and in fiscal 2014, delivered the highest orders and the highest operating margins since 2007.","In summary, for Applied Materials, fiscal 2014 was a year when we grew faster than our markets and made significant progress towards our strategic and financial goals. We accelerated our product momentum and strengthened the organization in key areas.","Looking forward to 2015. We expect a year of industry growth, where we are uniquely positioned to apply our capabilities in precision materials engineering and outgrow the industry. In order to take full advantage of the great opportunities ahead, we remain highly focused on improving execution.","Let me now hand the call over to Bob, who will provide additional details about our performance and explain the steps we are taking to drive alignment, speed and scale across the organization. Bob?","Robert J. Halliday","Thanks, Gary. In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year improvements across many areas of our business and achieved our guidance for revenue and EPS. Since this is the end of our fiscal year, let me begin by framing 2014 in the context of where we have been and where we are going.","We continue to believe that the market environment looks good, particularly for Applied Materials, and remains good for some time. This environment gives us a great opportunity to make money and efficiently return it to investors. There are 3 levers to making more money in our industry: first, understand customers' high-value problems and develop disruptive new products, as Gary described; second, achieve scale around our opportunities. We are doing this by focusing on our biggest opportunities in SSG and Display, winning share and merger with Tokyo Electron; and third, relentlessly grind away on efficiency, execution and cost.","In 2013, we shifted money to our biggest growth opportunities, primarily in SSG and Display. We also gained share in the overall WFE market, primarily by focusing on key battlegrounds, customer support and rapid product iteration. Our new and disruptive products were still early in the development stage.","In 2014, we further accelerated our funding of products that give us the greatest opportunities for growth. For example, we increased the combined funding of our conductor etch and CVD opportunities at 3x the rate of our overall investment. This past year, we began to see strong momentum from these products, as our combined revenue in conductor etch and CVD grew by 60% in fiscal 2014.","Thanks to our employees' efforts, we also kept grinding away on efficiency, execution and cost. For example, in 2014, we shifted an additional $200 million from our corporate functions and lower-return programs to fund our strongest opportunities in 300 millimeter and emerging technologies. We also achieved our 2% of materials cost savings for the year. As a result, we began to see signs of progress toward the target financial model we introduced in 2013. In fiscal 2014, the company recorded revenue of $9.1 billion. Excluding solar, this was the highest company revenue in 7 years, which demonstrated our strong momentum in SSG, Display and AGS.","On a non-GAAP basis, we increased gross margin to 44.1%, which was a 7-year high. This gross margin for the year did benefit from 0.5 point of non-run rate items. We increased operating margin by 6 points even as we maintained elevated R&D investments in our new product pipeline. We also achieved a 3-year high in both operating margin and net income. Our tax rate of 22.7% declined by 1.8 points as we implemented our more efficient structure, and we boosted our earnings by over 80% to $1.07 per share.","Now let's take a look at some of our 2014 segment results. SSG revenue grew by 25% to the highest level in 7 years. NAND orders were also at a 7-year high. In AGS, orders were at a 7-year high, which reflects customer pull for advanced service offerings enabled by our tighter collaboration between SSG and AGS. AGS operating margin was the highest since 2007.","In Display, orders achieved a 6-year high as the group took advantage of technology inflections and panel-size increases in the TV and mobile display markets. The Display group gained share and increased its operating margin to its highest level since 2011. EES generated a modest profit for the first time since the solar downturn.","Now what do see entering 2015? Our industry outlook is positive, and while it is too early to know the effects of timing and mix, we expect continued year-over-year growth and progress toward our target model. In 2015, we plan to introduce some of the new and disruptive products from our product pipeline investments. These products will drive share gains in 2015 and over time, but have lower margins initially. In 2015, we are working to further improve our gross margin even with aggressive new product ramps. In the first quarter, we expect gross margins to be lower sequentially, primarily due to share gains in our conductor etch business. Specifically, we expect our etch revenue to grow by almost 60% sequentially in Q1. We expect to increase our gross margins from Q1 through the balance of 2015. Overall, 2015 provides us with a further opportunity to systematically gain share in the fastest growing markets; drive scale in semiconductor display and services, both standalone and in combination with Tokyo Electron; and grind away at execution, efficiency and cost to improve the profitability of the company.","Now I will provide more color on our fourth quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.3 billion were down 9% sequentially, with decreases primarily in SSG and Display, partially offset by an increase in AGS. Net sales of $2.3 billion were in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased to 44.2%, which included a 0.5 point of non-recurring benefits. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 was in line with our guidance. Our operating cash flow was $407 million or 18% of revenue.","Next, I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders of $1.3 billion were down 15%, with decreases in memory and foundry more than offsetting increases in logic and other. SSG net sales of $1.4 billion were down 3%, in line with expectations. AGS orders of $747 million were up 35%, led by service contracts, and were the highest since 2007. AGS net sales of $592 million were better than expected. Display orders declined to $130 million, and we expect the pattern to remain lumpy. Display net sales of $190 million were up 60% as we began to ship the large orders received in the last 6 to 9 months. This quarterly revenue performance is also a 3-year high. EES orders were $44 million, and net sales were $48 million.","Now I will provide our first quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to up 5% sequentially. Our normal seasonal pattern would be for revenue to increase in our second quarter. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be approximately flat. AGS net sales should be down by a couple of points.","We expect Display net sales to be up by about 40% and EES net sales should be up by about $20 million. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 43%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $560 million, plus or minus $10 million, which includes 1 month of annual merit adjustments and the holiday shutdown. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29.","In summary, 2014 was a year of growth and improved profitability across all of Applied, including 25% revenue growth in SSG and 6 points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement for the whole company. In 2015, we believe we can increase revenue across all of our segments, gain share in SSG and further improve operating margin.","Now let me turn the call back over to Mike Sullivan for questions.","Michael Sullivan","Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions] Dustin, let's please begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","Christopher J. Muse - Evercore ISI, Research Division","I guess, first question on gross margin side. In terms of the downtick in the January quarter and then your positive outlook for the rest of the year, specific to January, is that particularly the new products on the conductor etch side? Or is that also reflecting a mix to only a handful of customers? And then, as you look beyond that, what gives you the confidence that you'll see that gross margin uplift through the end of the year?","Robert J. Halliday","Sure, I'll take that one. Most of it's due to the heavy etch shipments. We're shipping some new tools, frankly, so typically, the installation, warranty costs, material costs are higher. As you look at the mix through the year, etch is strong throughout the year, but as a percentage of SSG sales, it goes down later on the year, and we start to get better on the cost side of the equation also.","Christopher J. Muse - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, as my follow-up -- and I understand you can't talk too much on the regulatory part. But are there any lateral implications that we should be taking from Germany's sign-off, particularly around talk around them working with the DOJ as well as the fact that it was an unconditional approval?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, we were pleased to get signed off in Germany. Each country is -- does an independent process. And we're working constructively on the whole process. And today was a good event for us. The rest of them, we're in process frankly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Your target model for 2016, I think, is on $33.5 billion WFE, doing about $1.70 in EPS on just under $11 billion of revenue, if I'm not mistaken. How -- understanding you're ramping new products, which are a little bit lower margin, and there's some share gain in some lower-margin areas and also, that that's a 2016 model, not a 2015 model, it does look like we'll be at, at least $33.5 billion in WFE in 2015 now. So how much lower than that 2016 model do you think we'd be in 2015 if we do get to the $33.5 billion, given the pushes and pulls on the target model?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, it's a good question, Jim. Let me walk through it little bit. If you go look at the revenue line, we're actually making pretty good progress on the SSG share. We were probably, a year ago, a little behind on the AGS business, but we're picking up now. We had one of our strongest orders quarters ever. I think we're making real headway. So as you look through '15, '16, I can see reasonable revenue growth there. So we're going to get closer to the model and feel better there. The Display business is doing great, so that feels good. We got market share opportunities there. We're gaining. We have new products, so there's a lot of momentum there. And solar is even picking up a little bit. So I think the revenue line versus '16 is in the ballpark. Some of the new growthy stuff, we got to manage, but that's kind of lower-margin stuff, too. So the rev line's okay. Gross margin, we're kind of ahead of plan last year a little bit. So if you look at the $33.5 billion, I think we're supposed to be like 44.5%, I think, gross margin. We did about 44.1% on the year last year, up from about 40.9% back in '12, the base year. So I think we'll hit the gross margin model, maybe do a little better if we're lucky. So we'll do better I think. And then on expenses, we're a little bit above the expense line right now. I think we're going to work to manage that. We're investing real heavily in products, which drive the revenue line. If you look at where we're spending money, it's all in investment areas, not so much in overhead or cost areas. So overall, I'd say we're in the ballpark. The tax rate, we're making good progress. We should -- we hit 22%. We're probably -- might be a little bit of opportunity there. So net-net, we're in the ballpark. And we got a bunch of cash that we haven't done buybacks with, so the share count will come down, too.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's really helpful perspective. I appreciate that. For the follow-up, relative to the AGS orders, they were up a lot in the October quarter, and I think you said revenue would be down a little bit in that segment in the January quarter. Is that just kind of a seasonal uptick in orders in AGS? Or is there more of a structural component to that as well in terms of the big uptick in orders?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes. I think, really, 2 areas of focus for us within AGS. One is the value that we provide for our customers. And there's been huge improvement in helping our customers get -- providing value for our customers as they ramp these new device technologies. You look at the FinFET or 3D NAND, these are really tough transitions. And getting the tools to the defect level they need to be, uniformity, stability, to the entitlement that the tools are capable of achieving, is really huge value to our customers. So we've actually seen an uptick in our contract revenue. We're combining labor and parts, and that's more sustainable from a service perspective. And there's been a huge focus on the value in helping our customers move through those transitions. The other thing is we're really driving cost. We're driving cost from a parts perspective, labor delivery perspective. So that combination, we think, the value as our customers are moving through these tough transitions and are driving and lowering cost, we think it creates a great combination for sustainable growth in the service business that, frankly, we didn't achieve in the past. But we're pretty optimistic that we can keep driving that going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first one is, Gary, you said that you expect WFE to grow 10% to 15% this year. When I look at the SSG revenue, it's probably growing somewhere in the low teens. I'm kind of curious, if you're gaining share, where is the disconnect? Is it because rev rec is going to take a while? Or is there something else happening? And then I had a follow-up.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes. If you look at it overall wafer fab equipment share, last year, we gained 1.4%. What we said is SSG revenue's up 25% in -- from fiscal year to fiscal year. We haven't given any color certainly in terms of the calendar year. But I also had said earlier that we were pretty optimistic about wafer fab equipment increasing next year and that we would outgrow the industry. So if you look at the data points, kind of what's driving market share, these major technology transitions with FinFET and the memory transitions are really good for us relative to the TAM growth. We have TAM growth in those areas, very strong products. You see this in the foundry business with the record Epi sales, the metal deposition, the implant share. A number of those areas are extremely strong. And really -- so if you look at that, as customers are transitioning to these new transistors, these new FinFET devices, that's good for us. And also, in memory, we are also very well positioned. The etch and CVD share gains this year are going to create momentum for us going forward. As I talked about earlier, we have about 50% revenue growth in etch and CVD that we anticipate this year, and that provides, really, a great opportunity for us. So as these technology transitions happen going forward, we think we can build on the momentum that we have right now.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then a question for Bob. I know you can't answer questions on the merger, but just curious, there were some rules on the inversion path. Post merger, can you do buybacks without repatriating income back to the U.S.? And how much of your cash is onshore versus offshore?","Robert J. Halliday","I'll do the second one first. We're about half offshore, half onshore, and a little -- and some of the offshore stuff has already been provided through the tax provision. So it's -- the P&L impact's a little less than that. The second thing is, in terms of repatriation, we think we have a plan with our structure that we'll be able to efficiently return cash to investors and not have the substantive problem that you're talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Gary, I was hoping you could maybe help quantify your comments around calendar year '15 WFE. Is there a range of up that you should expect to see? Kind of what's the puts and takes around that range? And I guess, importantly, a lot of your peers have been talking about a pretty good start to the first half of calendar year '15. I would love to kind of get your perspective on what half-on-half growth might look like from the second half of this year into the first half of next year at an industry level.","Gary E. Dickerson","Okay, yes. Overall, what we see for 2015 is still continued strong foundry investment and really heavily weighted to the FinFET transition for customers. That's a really big battle for all of the different companies. We're also seeing some really strong pull even into 10-nanometer pilot. That's a small amount, but really focused on these technology transitions is really, we believe, will sustain strong foundry investment in 2015. Looking at memory investment as being up next year. And so we -- that, we believe, will be a positive, and then logic, we think, is relatively flat versus '14. On the question on first half, second half, we're not really giving any guidance on first half, second half, unless Bob wants to do that. But what we do see is 2015 up. Really, we think increased investment in memory and a really sustained strong investment in foundry, really focused on technology transitions.","John William Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Gary, that's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up for you, Gary. Some of your peers have talked about where we -- where they think we are in sort of the 2014 16-nanometer kind of build-out. I'd be curious from your perspective of what inning do you think the industry is in and where you think that might be by the middle of next year.","Gary E. Dickerson","Well, what we think is that 2015 is really going to be focused below 20 nanometer in terms of the majority of the investment. The -- it really is a huge focus. Every one of our customers in terms of coming out with lower-power, higher-performance devices, but power is a big driver, and so FinFET is a huge focus for every one of our customers. We -- there's always this war for mobility leadership. Every Christmas season, you see everyone competing for those slots in the new consumer devices, and FinFET is really the big focus for customers. So we see, from a CapEx standpoint in '15, that really being the majority of the investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things. First of all, Gary, there was some confusion recently around the amount of capacity for 2016 and '14 that'll be installed by the end of this year. There's different companies giving different numbers. So I'm wondering what your number is for the end of this year. It seems like the consensus is maybe 120,000 to 140,000 wafers a month, something like that.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, about 120,000 by the end of the year.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","120k. And then, Bob, I just want to go back to a prior question about the September 2013 just from treasury. They really went after hopscotch and decontrol. But -- so I just wanted to be very clear that, that doesn't change your ability to get the tax synergies that you highlighted or to buy back the $3 billion that you indicated post the deal.","Robert J. Halliday","Pretty much. I think there might be a tiny bit of money on that margin that gets delayed a little bit, but fundamentally, yes, we're okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question for Gary. Gary, you talked about the joint integration team has progressed faster than expectations. If you can provide a bit more color on what were the expectations and what metrics they've exceeded expectation? And relative to the $500 million OpEx synergies for the target model for 2017 for the combined companies, if we should be thinking of a higher synergy number? And then I have a follow-up.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes, relative to the progress for the integration team, we've really focused on the areas that need -- the things that need to happen to hit the ground running on Day 1. So we've aligned around the organization structure, especially focusing on the areas of highest value creation within the new company. And when we're aligned there, the culture, the mission, vision, values that really guide the behavior for all of our employees, we've aligned around that. And also, the operating rhythm, how are we going to drive the business, all aspects of the business, our strategy, our execution, our decisions around portfolio planning, all of those kinds of things, all of those areas have -- are aligned and ready to go for Day 1 for the new company. And what I would say is that the more that we're together, the more excitement there is and the more opportunities we see to provide better products faster and at lower cost to our customers. And so again, on the organization, culture, operating rhythm, all of these areas, very, very strong alignment and strong alignment to create value for our customers and for our shareholders. So there's a lot of excitement within the team.","Robert J. Halliday","In terms of the $500 million, couple of things. One, if you look independently at Tokyo Electron, it had a really good year. I mean, they're doing well in their operating margins. Their share looks like it's in good shape. So you got to give them great deal of credit for really good execution themselves this year. In terms of the $500 million, I think that it's in the ballpark of the right numbers. That was a '17 number. I'd like to -- I think what we're going to plan to do is get the deal closed. Then, we'll have an investor meeting within a week after is my guess and update people on the model in more detail.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And as a follow-up, foundry orders have been tricky to call in terms of timing as your customers are waiting for their customers to decide on the next processor. Is it fair to assume that the flat guidance for January and then in April, the outlook that could be higher than January, that the swing factor is predominantly on the foundry side?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, if you go and look at it, I think it's a pretty strong DRAM period right now. I think that foundry has an opportunity to pick up. So I think your read on the situation's in the ballpark.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On your higher WFE spending outlook for next year, as you mentioned, it does appear that it is weighted towards inflection technology spending. Can you just give us your view on the percent of the total mix that will be for inflection technology, FinFET, 20-nanometer DRAM, 3D NAND? Is it going to be 30% of WFE spend? 40%, majority of the spend? Any insights here would be appreciated.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes. On the foundry investment, we think over 50% is going to be for sub-20 nanometer. And as I said earlier, that is a huge battleground for all of our customers. And there's some spending even all the way down to 10 nanometer on the pilot that is being pulled in by some of our customers. In NAND flash, the 3D NAND ramp has been slower than what we had anticipated. This year, the majority of the investment has been for planar NAND. And where we're looking at right now, we still think that in 2015, that the majority of spending will be in planar NAND technology, and the transition to 3D NAND in terms of majority of the CapEx, we think, is more in 2016. What we do see from customers and talking to multiple customers is very good performance with 3D NAND technology. And also, the potential for bit scaling in 3D NAND is pretty significant. It is a tough technology transition, so it's happening slower than I think some of the customers had anticipated. But still, from a performance and cost standpoint, there are very good reasons to make that transition, but we think that one is more in the 2016 time frame, where that becomes the majority of the CapEx spending.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, Bob, you delivered on your target to drive a 2% reduction in materials cost. Can you just kind of help us understand? Is it more procurement driven or better platform design or a combination of both? And as you drive towards your 2016 model, how much more efficiencies can you drive in your COGS?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, the way we measure that is off the released bills of material pretty much. We get an incremental benefit through design, so most of that's engineering and purchasing working together. And AGS, everybody works together now. But the way we measure cost down is off a base number and how much we get off of that. Now what we're trying to do with new products is trying to introduce them more cost effectively also, but we measure that separately.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","One question. Just you sounded very bullish regarding the foundry FinFET ramp, but I'm wondering if you could give us your view on FinFET yield progress at the foundries and whether you think that there's some risk that yields might impact the ramp timing and overall 2015 demand outlook.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes. Based on what we're hearing right now, I would not anticipate that, that's going to -- will impact the perspective on the foundry investment for next year. What we see today and what we're hearing from customers is continued strong investment in CapEx next year and more heavily weighted towards those next-generation technology nodes.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And then just as a follow-up, I'm wondering if you could comment on demand in China and whether you're beginning to see visibility in the pipeline for new 300-millimeter fabs. And do you expect those -- that demand to pick up in 2015?","Robert J. Halliday","It's Bob. I think we see moderate amounts for that 300-millimeter local stuff. I think it's in there. We see it growing, but it's not a big number for us.","Gary E. Dickerson","I think our overall position in China is very good, but as Bob said, that the -- it's not a large driver for us next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Gary, first one, the CVB and etch share gains that you've mentioned to date, can you comment a little in terms of the customer segments that you've seen the most gains? And perhaps, more importantly, going forward, will there be additional incremental gains in both of those segments?","Gary E. Dickerson","Thanks for the question. Relative to both of those different markets, the gains for us are weighted, I would say, a little bit more in terms of memory than it is in the other market segments. We have very strong growth, as I talked about earlier. The etch revenue we're forecasting for 2014 is up 2.5x where we were 2 years ago, so very significant growth in terms of etch. And as I had mentioned earlier also, the combined revenue growth for etch and CVD in calendar 2014 is around 50%, we believe, those areas will grow. And we made -- as Bob talked about earlier, we made a lot of investments in new products, and those new products are really helping drive the share gains in both of those different markets. We're very well positioned as our customers are transitioning to new technologies. Part of the gross margin pressure also that Bob talked about is really significant ramp. We talked about 300 chambers for new products that we announced at SEMICON West that we're shipping and really significant growth in those new products right now, which is great from a share standpoint, really positions us well around those technology transitions, providing some gross margin pressure as we're introducing these products to new customers. But overall, we're very optimistic about our outlook going forward in those markets.","Robert J. Halliday","Let me give you some more color if I could, Patrick. I was kind of joking with the guys around here that sometimes we're off on timing, but let's be right -- let's be on the -- we could be on the wrong side of timing once in a while, but let's be on the right side of inevitability. So if you look at the opportunity for us, it's really big on inflections. That's where you make penetration. So if you look at inflections, we've talked about flash storage [ph] around FinFETs, VNAND, very positive for us because that's where we push through the windows with those tools. So if you look at etch and CVD, we're making a lot good progress, gaining a lot in memory, in particular on inflections. And in fact, if the VNAND had been a little more robust this year, we might have gained up to another 0.5 point of WFE this year. So that means it wasn't quite as robust this year, but everybody says it's coming, right? Is it '15, '16? But kind of on the right side of the inflection, right? So -- and then within the specific question you asked about etch and CVD, etch is making great progress. Look at the numbers, up a lot, up in Q1. And the other thing is if you look at -- and memory is where the revenues are, but we're making good progress in qualification at more complicated places like foundries, too. So again, going back to timing and inevitability, if you get the penetrations, get the market share, get the products right, you can also get the gross margins right over time. So you want to be on the right side of the trends, the inflections, the inevitability of these things and then grind out cost and profitability stuff, and that's what we're doing.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great, that's really helpful. And Bob, maybe specifically for you. You've obviously made improvements on the services business front, particularly on the operating margin line. Can you give a little more color in some of the specific tactics and moves that you guys have done that have helped drive the higher operating margins in that business group?","Robert J. Halliday","Well, it's not me. It's the SSG and AGS guys. I mean, AGS has worked really hard this year, and really, we're seeing some real progress. And they've work really collaboratively with SSG. I kind of think -- I'll go offline for a second. I kind of think we historically thought like equipment guys. We didn't think about the aftermarket, so we got much tighter alignment between the 2 groups this year. They shared bonus plans. They co-located. And you're starting to see real momentum with the teams. So I think getting people to work closely together, shared objectives, think about the service business has been a big plus. And I think they're just starting to turn the corner on that. I mean, you're starting to see the numbers. We saw it in the behavior, the tight relationships. So what are they tactically doing? They're doing some lower-cost sourcing. They're also doing some much more service contracts. You get sticky service revenues. So I think the strategy and execution in AGS and AGS working with SSG has been a big improvement on multiple fronts.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes. I would tell you on the cost front, as Bob said, Patrick, we are really focused on trying to drive lower cost in our parts, in our -- and also the delivery of our service to our customers. So that will -- that is sustainable, and we really think that we're in the early phases of what we can do there. As Bob said, we've reorganized the service groups so that there's a tighter connection between the SSG business units with our service teams to really focus on, as we're ramping Epi for FinFET or the CVD products for deposition on a VNAND type of device, so the VNAND stack, these are tough processes. So to the extent that we can have service together with our business units and a tighter alignment, as customers are moving through these transitions, defects are harder. Uniformity is harder. Stability is harder, all of these different things. And certainly, they're very focused on cost. So that focus on value is really changed, and the alignment between the groups is much better. And we really believe that the growth that we're seeing there is sustainable into the future.","Robert J. Halliday","In terms of the -- let me give you a little more color. I think we made real good progress now. I think I can see it on the revenue and on the margin line. The margins did benefit a little bit in '14 from some onetime stuff I talked about earlier, but over time, we're systemically making more progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Gary and Bob, I was wondering if you -- there's been some more positive commentary lately on EUV. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any changes to your customer roadmaps in terms of potentially integrating EUV into the roadmap sooner.","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes. As of right now, we really don't see a major change in terms of impact on our business until kind of post 10 nanometer. So for us, I think over the next few years, we don't see a major impact.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. And Bob, a quick question on the OpEx and maybe earnings leverage. How should we expect OpEx to trend over the next few quarters? And also, the EPS has been sort of in this $0.25 to $0.29 range for the past few quarters. When can we expect sort of better earnings leverage? Is it just from sort of the buybacks? Or should we expect other things to drive the EPS leverage as we look forward?","Robert J. Halliday","Sure. So on the OpEx, I'll say what I said at the beginning -- almost exactly a year ago this time. We tend to have a little bit of OpEx pressure early in the year because we give everybody a raise on the same date in early January. So we got about almost a month of that in this quarter, and then we have 3 months of it in the following quarter. And we do have the benefit of the shutdown in this quarter, and we're not planning it on into the second quarter. So there's a little bit of OpEx increased pressures typically for us in Q2. So we have to manage that. But I feel like there's a little bit upward pressure there, and we have to manage it to get within a tolerable range. The other thing is we have a lot of new products coming out, so that's driving the top line growth. In fact, give you more color on that, we think there's an excellent chance that we're going to gain -- grow revenue in every one of our segments last -- next year in '15. But we really have a lot of new products coming out. We have the R&D pipe, and even in AGS, there's some investments in revenue growth. So what's the point? I think expenses have a little bit upward pressure through the year. Part of it's the raises. Part of it's the number of new products coming out. So we have to work on that. In terms of the operating margins, EPS, as you start to get these products, and if you're in a decent WFE environment and we're making progress on the lines below that, including tax, we're starting to knock on the door, getting those higher numbers in terms of EPS.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question on your order -- segment orders. Your -- that looks a little different than what your peers have reported in general, foundry orders down significantly and DRAM up pretty significantly. Is there something different about your order pattern? Or it's just the 1-month offset that is causing that variation with the peers?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes, I would say that there's a couple of thoughts there. I think the 1-month thing throws it a little bit. The other thing is -- some of it -- even within our products, some of them have a little bit different phased purchase. For instance, our Epi tools at foundries tend to be about -- earlier in the cycle than later. So you got to go through all the mix. I don't think there's real fundamental difference in what we're seeing.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And a question on AGS. You had the revenue -- if I look at the calendar year or January quarter, January quarter revenue will be probably up close to 10% on AGS, about 22 50 [ph]. Where do you see that run rate? How should we look at AGS run rate over next couple of years?","Robert J. Halliday","Yes. Our goal is to grow that 6% to 8% type of numbers, which is in our strategic plan we gave you a couple of years ago. And we're starting to see that. The services were strong in the past quarter or 2. We're putting a little bit more money into the OpEx line to invest in some basically product type stuff in AGS. So sort of 68% is what our goal is.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","So first a clarification. Why is it that etch is growing so much faster than your other products in the first quarter? Is this simply just share gains off of a smaller base? Or is there more to it?","Robert J. Halliday","We think a couple of things going on. If you look at it, we believe we gained share on the year in '14. We gained share on the year in '13, and we're optimistic we'll gain share on the year in '15. Secondly, if you look at some of the timing of some of the places where we're gaining share, we talked about memory looking good for us, and it's a pretty good early part of the year for memory. Everybody's talking about places like DRAM and some NAND. So I think it's a trend over years, and then in the quarter, it's strong also, but it's probably ongoing trend.","Gary E. Dickerson","And also, it's the -- I think in the etch case, as we talked about earlier, we have some new products that have very strong pull from customers. So as those products are ramping, that also gives us a tailwind.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about '15 being another very strong year for the foundries. Are you going to see a broadening of your customer base, the number of players participating in the foundries in '15, do you believe, over '14? And if so, what kind of impact would that have on your overall share in the space?","Gary E. Dickerson","Well, foundry is a really strong position for us. We have many of the transistor and interconnect-enabling technologies. That's really driving our Epi, our metal deposition, implants, some of the areas that we talked about earlier that were extremely strong. So foundry spending is really very good for us. We have very good share in really all of the different foundries, so there's not a tremendous difference from one to the next. We do see some broadening relative to the investment in 2015, but the key thing for us, and as we've talked about before, especially in FinFET, as FinFET ramps, our total available market opportunity goes up 25% to 35%. And those are the areas where we have many leadership products. So that is very, very good for us from a growth perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So first question on -- just clarification on the commentary about higher memory spending in 2015. Is it mostly driven by DRAM growth that you talked about and less so from NAND? And is that more to do with just, call it, timing of the 3D NAND spending more like in terms [indiscernible] ? I'm just trying to understand if there's more DRAM, less NAND. Or is it pretty balanced for you in 2 buckets?","Gary E. Dickerson","I think, Edwin, it's pretty balanced based on what we see today and what we're hearing from customers. In both cases, we see memory spending up next year. As I said earlier, the 3D NAND transition is happening slower than we anticipated, so we see incremental investment in planar NAND. 3D NAND is broadening and is increasing in 2015, but we see both the NAND and DRAM investment up in 2015.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And then just kind of going back to etch. I'm trying to understand how much of that is just TAM expansion. It sounds like there's always a little bit more option maybe [ph] there? And I think you mentioned that at least initially, you guys have stronger position in memory, which helped you in etch. I'm thinking your product is -- have higher productivity than your competitor and that is one differentiation. Is that a big driver for customer to adopt that? And is that because -- because, I think, historically, memory customers tend to be more cautious there. Is that -- is productivity a big issue the customer is facing and you guys are able to win on that?","Gary E. Dickerson","Yes. I think, productivity -- overall cost of ownership is a big focus for everybody with more patterning steps. That's certainly a big focus. We actually have in the new products some very strong technology. If you look at areas like microloading, for instance, we've -- we have some very good capability there. CD uniformity is always a big issue for our customers. So we are seeing, not only on the cost of ownership side but also on the technology side, some really good opportunities for us to grow the business. We've strengthened that team a tremendous amount. It's really an outstanding group, tremendous passion in solving problems for customers -- high-value problems for customers. And as Bob talked about, we've increased investment there, both in R&D for the new products that are ramping now and in the field technical support. So we see very good pull. Certainly, in memory, we are gaining in logic, and we see pull on cost but also on the technology side.","Michael Sullivan","Thank you, everyone, for your question, and we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon.

Gary.","Gary Dickerson","","Thanks Mike and good afternoon. In our first fiscal quarter of 2014 Applied Materials delivered earnings near the high-end of our guidance range, while demonstrating momentum in revenue, orders and market share. This performance reflects healthy investments by our semiconductor and display customers and major technology trends that are playing to our strengths in precision materials engineering.","For Applied 2013 was a transformative year, we changed our spending profile and shifted more investment to product development. We strengthened our organization and business processes in key areas. And we started to prove the growth potential of our etch, inspection and display businesses. In 2014 every employee across the organization is focused on building our momentum for profitable growth. We are driving performance improvements in our financial model, improving product time to market and cost, driving higher quality and getting the organization ready for our merger with Tokyo Electron.","In recent months we have taken significant steps forward with our preparations for the merger. A joint Applied Tokyo Electron integration team is developing the detailed plan to being the two companies together. We\u2019re delighted with the level of engagement, enthusiasm and the strong working relationships that are already forming. The progress this team is making gives us increased confidence that we will be ready to execute as soon as the merger closes.","Each company is meeting regularly with customers to ensure that we are aligned with their priorities. Our discussions have centered on the value inherent in our combined ability to accelerate solutions for the industry\u2019s major materials innovation challenges.","The new company will be able to deliver more innovative products faster and at lower cost. We will have broader and deeper R&D capabilities to address roadmaps more effectively and with greater speed. By combining our field technical capabilities and best practices, we can collaborate more closely with our customers to support the rapid development of new device performance and yields solutions. And through operating synergies in many areas, we can focus our R&D investments to deliver the cost of ownership and materials engineering innovations that really move the industry forward.","We remained confident that we will receive approval for the merger in the mid to second half of this year and we expect to submit our S4 securities registration statement after we have filed Applied\u2019s Form-Q for this past quarter.","Turning to our market outlook, we believe 2013 wafer fab equipment spending ended the year towards the midpoint of our range of $27 billion to $30 billion. We expect investment levels to be stronger in 2014, up 10% to 20% driven by higher spending in foundry and memory. The foundries remained the biggest component of wafer fab equipment, as they ramp new factories to fulfill demand for advanced mobile chips and race to introduce new technology to enable devices with higher performance and longer battery life. We expect foundry investment to grow 10% to 20% this year, which is very positive for Applied as we have our strongest share positions as these customers and continue to make gains. ","Approximately half of total foundry spending this year will be focused on ramping 20 nanometer technology amended full for our products that enable transistor performance. And in our first quarter we have generated record orders in Taiwan. In addition, we recorded our highest ever quarterly net sales in FE, second highest shipments of medium implant tools and our highest quarterly PVD orders in a decade. Leading customers are also making significant investments in their pilot lines for FinFET. This technology has enabled biomaterials innovation and Applied has a broad and unique portfolio of products to enable flexion. We are collaborating early and deeply with our customers to ensure that they can quickly transition FinFET into volume production with the right performance, yield and cost.","We also expect a stronger year of spending by NAND customers, as mobility supports bit growth demand in the 40% to 50% range and 3D technology is introduced. We anticipate that total NAND investment will be around $7 billion with incremental spending in advanced planar NAND and initial investments in 3D NAND. The transition from planar to 3D NAND has enabled biomaterials innovation in thermal, deposition and etch processes. This plays directly to Applied\u2019s strengths in precision materials engineering and expands our total available market by about 25% for first generation devices. Overall, we are making significant gains in planar and 3D NAND. In our first quarter, we generated our highest NAND net sales in the past seven years. ","Consumption of mobile DRAM is also growing, providing a good foundation for increased investments in 2014. We expect DRAM customers to focus their spending on upgrading capacity to advanced nodes. In logic, we anticipate investment levels to be flat to down relative to 2013 with a high level of focus on advanced technology. ","Moving to the display market, we expect the TV unit growth rate to be low single-digit for the year ahead. However average TV sizes are growing at 1.2 to 2 inches annually which is significantly higher than historic norms. This is driving area growth in the 15% range which we believe is sufficient to support investment in three new Gen 8.5 factories. ","In mobile, screen resolution is becoming an important differentiator and we see significant growth in higher definition screens that require low temperature polysilicon backplanes. Consequently, we expect multiple Gen 6 LTPS factories to be built in the next 12 to 18 months to support this demand. Overall, we believe we have the potential to book $500 million of display orders over the next two quarters, although revenue patterns for the year maybe uneven as this equipment is delivered.","In both semiconductor and display, materials innovation is the key to enabling performance gains and lower costs for customers. FinFET, 3D NAND, cost effective device scaling and next generation displays are all enabled by precision materials engineering. Applied differentiated technologies in precision film deposition, materials removal, materials modification and interface engineering are enabling these key inflections. To support our customers\u2019 roadmaps, we accelerated R&D in fiscal 2013 by increasing our annual investment run rate in 300 millimeter semiconductor product development by $200 million, adding more than 500 R&D engineers. We are also investing over $150 million of capital and new lab capabilities. These investments have driven market share gains in our served market as well as increased our overall wafer fab equipment share in calendar 2013.","We are showing momentum in our traditional leadership areas and over the past year we have started to demonstrate excellent progress in markets that are large growth opportunities for us. ","In conductor etch; we have focused our strategy in the areas where we can deliver differentiated technology to address our customers\u2019 most pressing challenges. We believe we gained around 5 points of overall etch share in 2013 and continue to build momentum at leading memory and foundry customers. In wafer inspection and defect review, we believe we gained between 4 and 6 points of share last year. We have made investments in R&D and field technical support enabling us to increase our layer qualification in logic and foundry. Our UVision brightfield inspection product line delivered record net sales for the calendar year and our new UVision6 tool has recently being qualified by a leading customer for their most advanced node. In addition, we are strengthening our leadership in the e-beam review market.","In display, our pivot PiVot PVD tool continues to gain traction, complementing our clear leadership position in CVD. In the past quarter we secured 100% of the PVD and CVD business at the industry\u2019s largest metal oxide factory. Through increased R&D investment and focused portfolio management, we are creating a strong pipeline of new highly differentiated products to enable future infections in logic, memory and display.","Over the past quarter we have seen a number of customers accelerating their qualification of some of our most advanced products. This underlines the fundamental role of new materials engineering solutions in realizing next generation devices.","As we look to 2014 and beyond, we are incredibly excited about the future. We are uniquely positioned to apply our differentiated capabilities in precision materials engineering to enable major customer inflections and cost effective device scaling. This provides us with a great platform to build momentum for profitable growth. We remain highly focused on execution to ensure we take full advantage of these opportunities and to demonstrate progress against our financial performance goals.","We are preparing the organization for our merger with Tokyo Electron, a combination that will enable us to accelerate our ability to address the major materials innovation challenges facing the industry and increase the value we provide customers and shareholders.","I will now hand the call over to Bob, who will provide additional details about our performance and outlook.","Bob Halliday","","Thanks Gary. Over the last year we have discussed our commitment to accelerating momentum for profitable growth. This entails a commitment to grow profitably and accelerate our growth momentum. To grow we are aggressively rebalancing our spending towards semi and display products and tactical field resources focused on disruptive high value products. This quarter we increased R&D to 64.3% of R&D plus SG&A, which was up from 57% a year ago. We also increased our technical field resources by almost 20% in the same period. To grow profitably while making these investments, we are also driving improvements to our operating margins to achieve the profitability targets we have set out for the company.","We are driving for return on these investments in the short, intermediate and long-term. In the short-term Gary indicated some investments that are already giving us momentum. In inspection we leverage our investment in the technical applications organization to increase our layer qualifications and market share. In etch we rapidly iterated new products to win market share in both planar and 3D NAND. In the intermediate term, we see returns on our investments including more EPI steps utilizing new materials. Our new CVD tool which improves critical film control and the new CMP tool which enables higher cross [way for deployment].","In the longer-term our investments are targeting highly differentiated products in disruptive applications, some of which such as selected materials removal are $1 billion opportunities. Even while investing for future growth, we are striving to improve our operating margins, which increased in each of the past five quarters, benefiting both from revenue growth and our actions to improve them all.","This level of operating margin included R&D investment that is approximately four points above our history at the similar revenue levels. We are driving improvements in gross margins by delivering a greater mix of high value products in semiconductor and display and achieving materials cost reductions.","Our Q1 gross margins exceeded our original expectations and based on current business projections we now expect Q2 gross margins to be better than previously communicated. Our current projections are that Q3 and Q4 gross margins will further increase, resulting in over 100 basis point of improvement for the year. To further improve our model, we also reduced EES spending to below $25 million in Q1, down 40% from the same quarter last year. Our goal is for EES to breakeven for the year.","To accelerate our growth momentum we are revving up our product development engine. As Gary mentioned we are increasing our capital investment in R&D development tools by $150 million. Moreover we never stopped critical development projects, including during holiday shutdowns. We are also excited about our pilot manufacturing line which has already reduced product development cycle times while improving our initial product costs. ","Next I\u2019ll summarize some of the changes in our Q1 results versus the prior quarter. Orders of $2.3 billion were up 9% as growth in SSG and AGS was partially offset by a push out at display orders, net sales of $2.2 billion were at the high end of our expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin of 42.5% was up by about 0.5 due to higher silicon mix, non-GAAP operating expenses were $550 million, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23%, non-GAAP EPS of $0.23 was in the upper end of our guidance range. ","Cash from operations of $372 million was up substantially reflecting good collections and higher net income; we paid $120 million in dividends and ended the quarter with cash and investments up $226 million to $3.1 billion. ","Next I\u2019ll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders of $1.6 billion were up 13%, with increases in foundry and NAND offset by decline in logic and DRAM. SSG net sales of $1.5 billion were at the high end of our expectation as increases in NAND and foundry offset decreases in Logic and DRAM. SSG\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin increased three points to 24.1% on higher volume and favorable product mix. ","AGS orders of $597 million were up 9% due mainly to an increase in 200-millimeter equipment owners. AGS net sales of $507 million were in line with expectations. AGS\u2019 non-GAAP operating margin increased over three points 24.9%, driven by favorable mix in the higher spares margins. ","In display orders of $79 million were below our expectation reflecting the customer push out. However we expect a solid year for both TV and mobile investments. Display net sales of $159 million were flat which was above our expectations, due in part to grow the pivot PVD revenue which achieved a new record driven by share gains. Display non-GAAP offering margin increased by five points, 17% reflecting operational improvements. EES orders of $40 million were flat and net sales of $40 million were down 9%, the EES non-GAAP operating loss climbed to $10 million. ","Now I will provide our Q2 business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be up by 3-10% sequentially. Within this outlook we expect SSG net sales to be up by 6-10%. AGS net sales should be approximately flat; we expect display net sales to be down, flat to down 15%, consistent with the uneven revenue patterns of this business. And EES net sales should more than double. We expect our quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million plus or minus $10 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25-$0.29. ","In summary we are investing for growth while improving our model and accelerate our new product pipeline. We are very excited about our planned merger with Tokyo Electron, which will provide us with more strong products and technologies, to enable our customers' roadmap, a larger installed base of systems to service, substantial economies of scale and a unique opportunity to return more value to our shareholders. ","Now let me turn the call back over to Mike Sullivan for questions.","","Mike Sullivan","","Thanks Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow up. Friends, let\u2019s please begin.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan; please go ahead with your question.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","","Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution, as you look at your pipeline for the next few quarters, beyond fiscal Q2 I know there\u2019s been some concern about the potential for a pause in your SSG business just given the strong order trends, especially within foundry and NAND, obviously there will be some digestion, qualification and ramps, but obviously you\u2019ve not yet seen some of your DRAM customers transitioning to different nodes, we haven\u2019t seen the tier 2 foundries and your logic customer has been relatively muted, so I guess the question is, how are you thinking directionally about sort of the near term trajectory within SSG.","Unidentified company representative","","Hi Harlan, obviously we only guided for the next quarter, we think the year\u2019s pretty good as we said, the year is up 10-20%, as we do have very large customers sometimes there\u2019s bumps along the road in any given quarter but right now we see the second half pretty good actually, we think the year is pretty good and the balance between the years is pretty good and I think our position within these inflexions is really good.","Gary Dickerson","","Yes on the foundry customers 20-nanometer ramp is going to be major factor in terms of CapEx spending this year. We also see all of the customers really focused on FinFET, the FinFET transition, that\u2019s a huge strategic battle for all of the different foundry customers so we see more technology buys this year as all of those customers raised to be the first to have a cost effective FinFET device with high yield. And we also see as you mentioned a broadening relative to the foundry investments that is positive for the year. NAND is also up both in planar and in 3D NAND, 3D NAND really mostly focused on technology buys for those customers.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","Great. Thank you for that answer. And then good job on the OpEx to syncline here in Q1 and on the guide for Q2. Bob, how should we think about you OpEx trajectory either on an absolute basis or relative to your sales growth as we think about the second half?","Bob Halliday","I think as we said, we\u2019re basically flat in the second quarter. I think we had some R&D projects, a few one which we continue to pursue as well as aggressively managing the balance between pushing products out faster and spending, so we have those dials, we're always monitoring. My guess is next quarter is the 550 number, after that could be up a little bit but not big time pretty close.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks to let me ask the questions, congratulations on good results. Gary I wondering if you can just give us some of your insights relative to your 10% to 20% year-over-year growth range for \u201914, what are the variables in your mind that drive that to the low end versus the high end of the range, is it simply how end demand for 20-nanometer plays out as they ramp that capacity or there are other variable that you\u2019re thinking about within that range?","Gary Dickerson","Well, again, any one customer shifting at the end of the year can change that number a fair amount, if a project which is out one quarter that makes a big difference in terms of the end result. But if you look overall again on the foundry customers, certainly 20-nonometer ramping is a big factor in foundry and that one it looks like that is pretty much on tract. FinFET is a big, really strategic battle for our customers and we see a lot of focus there from a technology development perspective not so much significant capacity buying in 2014, but definitely that\u2019s a factor in the overall CapEx. And then we do see incremental buying if you go below the first three customers in a broadening of CapEx spending in 2014.","NAND flash, we see certainly good demand in that market and so planar NAND investment is definitely picking up. And on 3D NAND I think it\u2019s well known, one customer is ramping capacity there. But this is really another important strategic battle in the NAND business and we see incremental spending from a technology standpoint really across the Board for all of those different customers. That transition from planar to 3D is a tough transition. We\u2019ve talked about that being really leveraging a lot of the technologies we have we then applied on the materials innovation, but it is a tough technology transition. So I would say one factor is really relating to how fast that yield ramps and the cost comes down and also the adoption of those new devices with the end-customers is another factor.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","And then Gary as my follow-up just focusing on memory overall, clearly DRAM orders were down pretty healthy in the quarter for you, but if you look at both DRAM and NAND and you combine that for you and you look at where you are today versus sort of some of the peak levels you saw in April 2010 or even April 2007, you seemed to be down further from peaks and some of your peers and I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s driving that, is it really based upon the fact that a lot of your share gains come at 3D and you\u2019re seeing more strength at planar capacity or can you help me understand, you seem to be lower off of your peak than some of your peers in memory overall?","Gary Dickerson","Well I think and as we mentioned, NAND this last quarter for us was really the highest it\u2019s been in seven years. So we have a lot of momentum there both in planar and 3D and that one we also think will be very strong for us going forward. A lot of tough technology inflections we have really great products around a lot of these critical processes, we talked about some of that in the July 8th Investor Meeting and that we are still very much on track with what we discussed. ","In the DRAM market, one of the changes that are happening there is really in the periphery where that\u2019s becoming more logic like, that\u2019s another one that really periphery hasn\u2019t been there in the past because the periphery is behind of course where logic is but that is also helping us going forward in the DRAM business.","And we do some momentum there in other products but overall memory for us has been better than it\u2019s been in a long time and we have good opportunities to grow going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Great guys, thanks so much for taking the question I appreciate it. Gary on 3D NAND your comments there are appreciated. We've heard some companies say this week at their conference that there could be two customers actually running 3D NAND wafer starts by the end of 2014, not just the one significant one. Is that consistent with your view and if it is, we seem to have come a long way from six months ago when people doubted the 3D NAND was even going to work to some customers actually accelerating adoption?","Gary Dickerson","Well, thanks for the question. Just with a customer, another customer yesterday and they are planning to convert one of their factories from planner to 3D NAND. But what I would also -- so -- and all of the customers are very focused on this technology, the opportunity for bit scaling, it's pretty compelling but what I would also -- so that\u2019s absolutely correct. What I would also say is that this is a difficult transition. Customers are making good progress in the transition but I think it\u2019s somewhat too early to call in terms of actually how big this will be in 2014. Certainly 2015 there is a lot of customers that are ramping or planning to ramp 3D NAND technology. We're in calendar \u201914 and a lot of things have to line up really for significant capacity expansions in this calendar year. Again, it is very compelling but you have also a tough technology transition and then also adoption from an end user perspective that still has to play out this year.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","It\u2019s helpful. Thanks. For the follow up on the foundry side again foundries and other topics has gotten pretty contentious slightly with some people very concerned about foundry spending for the year after TSMC guided to being down a little bit. You\u2019re suggesting foundry CapEx is going to be up comfortably. Do you think that\u2019s more of a function of some of the other foundries beyond TSMC being more aggressive and I know global foundries made some high profile announcements. Where do you think there is some spending happening that might be slightly different from publicly stated budgets? Thanks a lot.","Gary Dickerson","Well thanks. Yes, I think we\u2019re not going to comment on anything our customers are saying. But we certainly see a broadening of the CapEx spending in 2014 in foundry. And as I talked about earlier certainly we see very healthy spending on 20 nanometer in 2014, FinFET is a very critical strategic battle in the war for mobility leadership. All of our customers are very focused in that area and technology buys in FinFET are also going to be a factor in 2014.","Bob Halliday","Yes, this is Bob, [indiscernible] Jim but going to back to what you said and John, every year you try and characterize and get a feel for the year. Mine 2014s characterized by two things. One is, there is a lot of technology inflections coming whether it\u2019s VNAND or its [indiscernible] and tough challenge one. They are compelling ones when they provide great value but there is a number of real challenging technology inflections issue number one. ","Number two, the spending were a little broader than it's been in last couple of years. So some of the foundries are spending money you haven\u2019t seen this much in the past so it\u2019s spreading out more. And what does that mean for Applied Materials? I think the technology inflections are a great opportunity for us and where you see us gain share particularly are on those inflections and foundry and NAND. As those inflections come to bear in DRAM particularly in the periphery we would do well in inflections. So inflections are great opportunities for Applied particularly as those inflections are going more to materials innovation.","Gary Dickerson","And I guess one more thing I would say on this one is, I really believe that a really key theme is around the materials inflections. If you look at what\u2019s happening in the foundry business, it\u2019s about transistor interconnectors becoming more difficult. And that\u2019s all new materials enabling these changes in device performance. The same thing is true certainly in NAND. And if you look at DRAM to keep scaling those devices from a cost effective standpoint, there are also going to be major changes in the future around materials and devices that are also playing into the sweet spot of Applied Materials.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company","Thanks a lot. Couple of questions, first, Gary how do you think about the trajectory of this year? You just put out a billion dollars in foundry orders and you put up a billion dollars in orders out of Taiwan, phase one of a large 3D NAND project is basically done now and we\u2019re sort of waiting on FinFET to ramp. So do you at all worry that there is this pause sort of in the middle of the year or do you think that there is enough other stuff happening?","Bob Halliday","Hey Tim, Gary just waved to me to take this one first. We got to get one of those video conferencing systems. So here is what [indiscernible] help a little bit. If you look at the last couple of years, there has been little bit of seasonality where the big foundry customers in particular buy more heavily -- give you orders more heavily in the [frontend of the year] get ready sort of just to be back to school, now it's more Christmas and Chinese New Year. ","So, you are probably going to get a little bit of that waiting this year. It does look like it\u2019s not going to be a big drop-off in the middle as people predict because we have more spread among different customers, so it\u2019s more spread out as I said earlier. ","The second one is that we have these technology inflections. Now those are the ones that you guys are poking at that are harder to lead. How big is 20 nanometer and how soon are FinFETs ready. What we see is customers aggressively pursuing those and frankly aggressively pursuing them with some of our tools and our solutions. ","The cutover from one node to another, not exactly sure of the smoothness of that cutover, the two things that make us feel better are one is, some more customers buying for different nodes right now and two, they are really aggressively pursuing these technologies because they are very compelling. And three, they are aggressively pursuing it with us. So is there a little bit of a bubble in here somewhere maybe, but it's hard to read because of the inflections.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company","","Got it, okay, thanks. And then maybe just Gary, relative to the proposed merger, and I don\u2019t know if you can imagine this question, but are you seeing any customer blowback not from their tone or anything like that but from them maybe trying to shift share to other vendors in an attempt to sort of like prepare for, when this merger closes, are you seeing any of that?","Gary Dickerson","","Well, Tim, the key thing for our customers, they are all in really strategic inflections for their business, if you look at the foundry customers ramping 20 nanometer successfully is critically important, transitioning the FinFET technology is critically important, this transition from planar to 3D NAND, all of those things are involving really in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. And I am travelling to Asia probably every other week now, meeting with a lot of customers. We still see tremendous pull from customers as these are the strategic issues, strategic inflections that are facing our customers and we see very strong pull and still confident in our ability to grow the company. And certainly we also see a great opportunity in the combination with Tokyo Electron to accelerate our products and the combination again we believe will help us address these key material innovation challenges for customers that are the key strategic issue for this industry. ","Bob Halliday","","Yes, Tim, maybe I can jump in this one a little bit. I mean there is, the theory put forth that customers might be concerned about that but if you look at the track record, Gary and I have together for 10 years and Gary for 18 years before at KLA. We believe the win-win for customers and ourselves is to aggressively invest into new products which really help them get to the next device and help yield nice performance, and that\u2019s the win-win. So, if you look at [vary] where we went from 30% margin to 75%, it was because we got better solutions. If you look at Applied, what we are doing are aggressively putting money in to products, technical resources in the field and that\u2019s to help the customer. So, there is a long body of evidence that\u2019s our track that help customers do better job with their devices.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question. ","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","","Thank you very much and also congrats on the quarter and the outlook. Maybe a first question on, in terms of the EUV story out there, with further delays that are likely to come on that front, have you revised your etch and deposition market outlooks given that you are going to see increased double and multiple patterning techniques?","Gary Dickerson","","Well, I think definitely that provides a growth opportunity and as I talked about earlier, we are gaining share in etch especially in foundry and in the NAND business. So, we have really good momentum there. We are seeing strong pull from customers also in the deposition area. Hardmask is an area where we have a pretty strong position and then we have new technologies some that we talked about around selective material removal and some other areas that are coming out of the technology pipeline that also create opportunities for us. So, absolutely we look at this as a good opportunity for Applied.","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, great. And maybe just a question on the memory side, on the NAND side, customers have to make that difficult choice between migrating on the planar side or transitioning to 3D NAND, how are you guys helping them along in that transition and what are customers doing in terms of making that challenging decision of expanding the current technology versus going full tilt into 3D NAND?","Gary Dickerson","","Yes, all of the customers are very focused on trying to make this transition from planar to 3D because it is compelling. If you look at the big growth opportunity in the transition from planar to 3D NAND, that is a big focus for all of our customers. As we talk about first generation, so you have a certain number of layers that you are building up when you go to 3D NAND. That first generation for us, we see about 25% increase in our total available market and we\u2019re also gaining share in the initial customers that are transitioning into 3D NAND. One of the things we talked about at the July 8th Investor Meeting is where are the critical deposition steps, as you are making this transition and we talked about our position in that inflection and that -- we're still pretty much on track Patrick with what we talked about last summer. Certainly the inflection is around thermal deposition and etch, we have some very strong products. That\u2019s where a lot of this investment is going for our customers, very strong pull. The first generation for us is going well and we believe there are more opportunities going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Terence Whalen - Citi","","This question relates to the timing of completion of the merger. Can you update us on what your expectation is for that time, how that\u2019s changed and what milestones we can look for in the coming couple of quarters. Thanks.","Gary Dickerson","So nothing has really changed relative to what we\u2019ve talked about previously on the economics or the timing of the merger. We\u2019re moving through the regulatory process. We mentioned that we\u2019ll be filing the S4 after we file our 10-Q later this month. So I would say we\u2019re still on track with what we had discussed before mid to late 2014 relative to the approval and the close.","Terence Whalen - Citi","And the switching gears a little bit, I think you mentioned had record revenue levels and current implant and also PVD. Maybe just focusing on EPI and PVD, now that you\u2019ve seen sort of initial installations of 3D NAND and also of FinFET for foundry, what are your expectations for growth of the EPI segment in 2014 and perhaps of PVD as well? Thank you.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, I think if you look at where the industry is going, the performance gains are really being driven by new material. So if you look at the focus in foundry, it\u2019s how do I add more features, better performance but I also have to have low power and battery life. So what we\u2019re seeing - and the same thing is true again. As you make the change from Planar to 3D NAND, as we talked about is very focused on materials innovation.","If you look at future memory devices like MRAM, very PVD intensive type of a process, many new materials. And I really think that these are major changes for the customers, major changes in device architecture, many new materials and we really see that continuing. If you look at where do people go beyond first generation FinFET devices, we really see more EPI steps, more PVD, many new materials, and when I\u2019m talking to the customers, this is the key challenge for them, how do they keep driving Moore\u2019s law and make that cost effective. And materials, if you look at what\u2019s happened with Planar to 3D NAND change, it\u2019s less litho intensive and really focused on materials. We see that trend continuing forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephen Chin - UBS","","Great, thanks hi Gary and Bob. Nice results off there. My first question was just a follow up on the reported foundry orders in the quarter. It looks like Applied\u2019s orders and foundries was significantly stronger than Tokyo Electron\u2019s reported foundry orders. I was just wondering is that because Applied has this extra month of January in it, in the month of January, it was a very strong foundry order month, or is there something more complex to that?","Gary Dickerson","Yes. We think we\u2019re doing very well as a company with foundries particularly in Taiwan because if you look at what they\u2019re doing Steve, it\u2019s 20 nanometer devices, big spending early part of the year and then later in the year its FinFET. 20 nanometer devices use PVD tools big time for things like Metal Gates, use FE tools big time.","So the inflections going on at the foundry play very well to our strains. If you look at PVD, very strong share there, very high share in FE, it\u2019s a growing market. The question we just got asked about FE, everything we see empirically about the FE market is good and the directional element of the FE feels very good. So I think the products we offer and services for foundries are very compelling at this point and I think that helped Applied Materials more than other companies.","Stephen Chin - UBS","And maybe as my follow up question on 3D NAND, maybe you could share some more color on AMAT\u2019s share of etch versus deposition in this 3D versus planar transition unit. It sounds like Applied is doing quite well in etch and 3D NAND. But just curious how -- I guess Applied\u2019s deposition momentum is in 3D NAND. Is it just as many incremental wins as etch? I just couldn\u2019t tell from the color.","Gary Dickerson","Yes, on the 3D NAND I think one thing, if you go back and look at what we discussed at the July 8th meeting. Basically what we did on the deposition side was lay out many of the critical steps across the largest customers and we talked about winning 75% of those steps. We are still very much on track with what we talked about July 8th. We have some very, very good products that provide customers with better device performance and yield and certainly that is a critical element for them as they make this transition. But we also have very good cost of ownership relative to other choices that they could make there. So deposition we looked this year will be very strong for us. PVD, we believe that V-NAND will be strong, additional share gains for us in foundry. So 2014 for the CDD business also will be very strong for us.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with DA Davidson. Please go ahead with your question.","Tom Diffely - DA Davidson","","Maybe another question on that topic. You talked about some nice share gains last year, I\u2019m curious, do they come at the expense of Tokyo Electron.","Bob Halliday","","There\u2019s really very little overlap, if you look at the products that we have, you know TEL is track, batch furnaces, Webclean, there\u2019s really, really very little product overlap between the two companies.","Gary Dickerson","","I can\u2019t think of anything because the only place we normally have similar products is etch and we\u2019re focused on conductor etch, they're in dialectric etch.","Tom Diffely - DA Davidson","","Okay, and I\u2019m wondering if you just give maybe some broad strokes on how you think the TEL market share went last year.","Gary Dickerson","","Oh, we\u2019re two separate companies. We don\u2019t have enough insight into them to comment for them.","Tom Diffely - DA Davidson","","Okay, then finally, you gave us the kicker you got the 25% increase you get going into 3D NAND. Do you have a similar number for going to FinFET, 40-nanometer FinFET?","Gary Dickerson","","It\u2019s a similar number, it\u2019s in the same range. If you look at the transition from 20-A to the FinFET device node, it\u2019s a similar number and as Bob said, as you go beyond even first generation FinFET we\u2019re seeing some really strong pull for more materials innovation, more staffs like FE increasing as you go beyond first generation FinFET.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Two quick questions. First, Gary you mentioned about a $7 billion in NAND WFE [ph] this year and overall WFE of $31 billion to $34 billion. I\u2019m kind of curious, of that $7 billion how much do you think is 3D NAND, or of the overall $31 billion to $34 billion what percentage of spending is 3D NAND and FinFET, where you\u2019re seeing this technology inflexion.","Gary Dickerson","","What I would say on both of those, if you look at the FinFET investment, a lot of technology buys there, and then you have - certainly technology buys across the board, and the 3D NAND transition from planar. So it\u2019s probably 25% - 30% if you look at both of those technology transitions. It could be higher, depending on the adoption, the rate of adoption, but it\u2019s in that range somewhere.","","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then as a follow up, I have a question on a -- a clarification on the numbers you guys gave in September post the merger. The 17% tax rate post the merger by reincorporating in Netherlands, is that as simple as reincorporating in Netherlands or do you need to ship a certain amount of revenue out of Netherlands or have some employee, a certain number of employees there?","Gary Dickerson","","Mostly incorporating in the Netherlands.","","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just reincorporating is good enough. You don\u2019t need any revenue out of Netherlands.","Gary Dickerson","","Our substantial operations will not [indiscernible].","","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets","Again going back to the foundry, definitely you reported pretty good numbers, much better than your peers. I\u2019m just trying to understand the linearity of 20-nanometer and 40-nanometer. Since 20-nanometer is going to be a smaller node, is it fair to say that the capacity addition for 20-nanometer is almost complete and the next round of foundry orders will be more along the line of FinFET?","Gary Dickerson","","We still see 20-nanometer being a significant amount of 2014 CapEx. The other thing is that a lot of the tools are similar for 20-nanometer and FinFETs including a lot of the backend lines stuff.","","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets","And do you see multiple customers doing 20-nanometer or most customers will focus on 16-14 or FinFET technology and there\u2019s going to be just one customer on 20-nanometer.","Gary Dickerson","","You know, as Bob said, typically what happens is that customers buy the tools for multiple technology nodes. So when they\u2019re buying for 20-nanometer, some of those tools are also going to be used as they go forward in FinFET. Some will stay at the previous technology node. But we don\u2019t really see significant production buys only for FinFET technologies in 2014.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company","So, on the WFE [ph] outlook for top 10 % to 20%, I felt that [indiscernible] high obviously with early on the year but Bob or Gary, what do you think will drive the upside, downside? Is it broadening all customer or is it specific if you pick a project that might not happen or happen this year? How do you kind think about potential upside or downside to that range?","Bob Halliday","Upside downside on the -- Gary can answer little bit. I think, I will give you the characteristics, then the potential upside downside. The characteristics of the headwind as I said earlier are, the spending is a little bit more diverse. So you\u2019ve got more foundry customers spending, some more memory customers spending money. So that\u2019s a good thing and some of those people not all have the same technology inflections. So that diversity gives a little bit incremental confidence. Second is the other big thing going on this year is the technology inflection between planar NAND and VNAND and between 20-nanometer and FinFET. That\u2019s what I was debating.","We see a lot of push for those. What would make the year bigger, I don\u2019t know. If there was a bigger production buys of 20-nanometer or earlier production with the FinFET. So that would be foundry issues. Now, I do think the spread out to multiple foundry customers gives you a little bit of cushion on the volatility. The second on VNAND, I think it\u2019s going to be a pretty good NAND year. We see it in planar entry there. The rate of transition from one to the other, it\u2019s little hard to predict. What I will say is common to both FinFET and VNAND. If you look at the device benefits of VNAND long term very, 3D VNAND very compelling, FinFET very compelling.","So there is a lot of incentive to customers to quickly push to those for the absolute device benefits and the competitive benefits. Those things would make you feel little bit more optimistic that spending will be good.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company","And then I guess one question I have on Tokyo Electron merger. I think you guys talked about the benefit including some synergies, especially on the revenue side synergy. I was wondering how do we kind of think about that? Is this something that we should kind of think about or the technical synergy you can get and therefore those will start to drive incremental revenue that we should expect and obviously the merge is done immediately in 2015 or is there something the technical synergy will eventually lead to newer product or better product and as we know in semi space it takes one or two years just to get the product into the customer hand and get the qualifying ramp? How do you kind of think about the timing of those revenue synergies income?","Bob Halliday","That\u2019s a good question. There is a limited amount that we can do right now relative to really understanding a lot of details around the technology synergies between the two companies. But I what I would say is that the big challenge facing the industry, as I\u2019ve talked about before is material innovation. Materials innovation is really driving performance gains in logic and memory. And we really think that will increase in importance going forward. Really innovation is also connecting dots and to the extent that Powell has some very good complementary technologies that we can work together in providing new solutions -- we do think there is a real opportunity there and this is the strategic issue facing the industry is how fast do we make these technology transitions into the new devices. You see it today with FinFET and 3D NAND being really difficult challenges. So we\u2019re pretty excited. As I talked about earlier, the interaction we\u2019ve had with the TEL people so far has been very positive, very enthusiastic. We would love to get working on those technology synergies and so we\u2019re looking forward to the close and we can start getting into more detail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Chad Dillon - Deutsche Bank","This is Chad Dillon on the line for Vishal. You've been very focused on gaining share in the inspection market over the past year. So I was hoping you could discuss where you think your share is at 20 nanometer, and how it compares to 28 at this stage of a new node ramp?","Gary Dickerson","So we have very, very strong pull from customers. As we\u2019ve talked about earlier we\u2019re making investments both in terms of product development and also in terms of application support. We\u2019ve had a lot of momentum in foundry and logic. As we talked about we had record inspection sales in the last calendar year. And we have a very strong position in e-beam review. And that business is pretty sizable and we\u2019re really extending our leadership in e-beam review, pretty much across the board at all of the different customers.","In the foundry business, the momentum there has been very good. That is part of what\u2019s contributing to our record in the foundry in the last quarter. The layer penetration for us is increasing as over the last year, really across the board we also talked about in logic having a customer adopting the UVision 6 for their most advanced technology node. So we\u2019re pretty optimistic.","Chad Dillon - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then as you progress through 2014, what\u2019s your expectations for the first half, second half mix of WFE spending if you break it down between memory versus foundry\/logic?","Gary Dickerson","So we have two questions then; wafer fab equipment spending first half, second half -- and the second is the breakdown between them. So if you look at I think the halves in total are pretty equal in terms of the mix -- pretty equal to -- you have inflections going on, that makes it a little harder to predict. So we think that the foundry could be pretty strong in the back until we get either 20-nanometer that have some legs or FinFET to come in. So we\u2019re looking at both to be pretty even through the year. Maybe getting DRAM is a little bit heavy on the front end.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna","Yes. I have two questions, one for Bob. Going back to slide that you have first announcement of for the Tokyo Electron merger, the 240 earning based on $37 billion WFE. How should I think about the stability of the model with different scenarios in case or worst case scenario we don\u2019t hit the $37 billion of WFE?","Bob Halliday","That\u2019s a good question Mehdi. If you go back to the Analyst Day at July 8th, we put a couple of different models up for 2016 for Applied Materials. We had a $37 billion model which was 25.6% of operating margins and a $30 billion model which I think is about 22%, 23% I don\u2019t know, it was in the low 20s, a little less couple of points less. And then models weren\u2019t as important to me as what the message was. The message was we are not running the company into a $37 billion wafer fab equipment number. We are managing Applied and we\u2019re going to manage the combined company to a reasonable sort of mid-cycle number of around $28 billion to $30 billion. Our cost structures would be built around that, our investments would be built around that, our flexibility would be built around that. That\u2019s how we will manage the company. We\u2019ve had good alignment with Tokyo Electron that they agree that\u2019s a good way to manage a company in this industry. And if we can do that and achieve low 20s and $30 billion and wafer fab equipment I think you\u2019ll have great confidence that if $37 billion happens we\u2019ll hit our model.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna","Okay. And then one clarification question for Gary. During your last conference call you told us that in the area of 3D NAND opportunities per wafer start would increase by 30%. And I\u2019m assuming the TEL opportunity. And today you\u2019re talking about 25% increase. What am I missing here?","Gary Dickerson","Well, so there is really a range in terms of how much the CapEx increases for us. There is first generation versus second generation 3D NAND. It\u2019s in the range on a first generation in 25%-30%. These are -- it's difficult to call that closely in terms of what that exact number is on the first generation but it\u2019s pretty significant. If you look at some areas, some areas are up more than 50%, some specific markets for us are up significant amount. But the first generation is in that range and of course as you know, they are going to keep going vertical to drive this scaling beyond the first generation. So the increase there is more. So it\u2019s really the starting point and sometimes people will talk about 3D NAND overall. We\u2019re trying to be specific around first generation, what that number will look like.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna","Can I ask you a follow up?","Gary Dickerson","Sure. Go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna","I\u2019m little bit confused because I understand the number of statutory is up, the number of the steps goes up, obviously the capital intensity is going up. But we were in Phoenix this past Friday and one of the memory manufacturer with the goal of having 3D private line sometimes in the next 24 months is also talking about very proven CapEx, capital intensity actually going down in fiscal year \u201915. So help me reconcile the two different messages from your customers and from equipment suppliers. What am I missing here? They\u2019re talking about capital intensity on the management going down and after 2014 but equipment industry is seeing something different.","Bob Halliday","Let me take a shot and then Gary will give you better answer. I get asked this question in a reasonable amount. I get asked the questions well, it was one of the companies that talked about overall capital intensity going up, number one and number two, they\u2019re doing their overall turn. So the first question I typically get asked is overall. Well you got to look at the mix. Now if you go look within foundry, within NAND, within DRAM and Logic and let\u2019s pick foundry where we talk a lot about the biggest part of the share, I don\u2019t think anyone doubts capital intensity is going up. If you go look at how much it costs to build a 50,000 wafer fab equipment, the cost is gone up. So within that segment it\u2019s gone up. If you look at Logic it\u2019s got more expensive and where you\u2019d have to parse [indiscernible] is Greenfield versus reuse and reuse is a bigger issue than Logic.","If you look at VNAND, it\u2019s going up for first generation in total but it\u2019s very much going up where we play which is deposition, etch and thermal. If you look at lithography which has been really driving the cost bus for NAND in the last number of years is going down. The next generation VNAND is probably 50 nanometer target versus 10 nanometer. So it\u2019s reuse through existing lithography. So they can be very prudent in NAND, in that total CapEx because the big cost of lithography has been eased. What they doing is it\u2019s much more cost effective for them to use things like etch, deposition and thermal.","I think then when you go to DRAM which is the final market, the cost has been moderate but the cost has been somewhat obscured because you haven\u2019t had lot of new Greenfield. So measurements were a little bit harder. As you look at next generation the capital intensive -- entry of a new DRAM fab is going up some, particularly because the periphery is becoming more logical, like it will fall to same capital intensity that foundry and logic have. So, I think you go look in the mix between -- next featuring Greenfield and reuse and then you will look at the mix within equipment type. And I think those things are consistent with what we\u2019ve said, particularly the NAND question you asked.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, thanks, Mattie. And I know we are running a little bit over but if we have one more on the line we will go ahead and please try to help.","Operator","","Yes sir, your final question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Northland Capital. Please go ahead with your question. ","Ben Pang - Northland Capital","","Thank you for squeezing me in. First on the etch share gain, you commented on 5% share gain and kind of concentration on conductor etch. Does that imply your conductor share gain is like 10%?","Bob Halliday","","Yes, I think if you do the math that\u2019s pretty close.","Ben Pang - Northland Capital","","Okay. And then in terms of your wafer fab equipment outlook, a lot of technology transition et cetera and kind of broadening of the base. Does that imply that the spend is going to be I guess less tied to the utilization rates and kind of the end demand for semiconductor this year?","Gary Dickerson","","I\u2019m sorry Ben. I lost you on that one. The voice faded for on me a second. Could you just quickly repeat it?","Ben Pang - Northland Capital","","I guess the base case for semiconductor growth in the high single-digit type situation and your utilization rates are kind of not great right now. Do you see a big impact to the pattern of wafer fab equipment spending this year on those type of dynamics. Since it\u2019s mostly technology transition I would assume that it doesn\u2019t matter whether the utilization rates move up and down a little bit or the semiconductor demand get cuddled but. That might not actually impact the spending on the technology transition. Is that the right way you guys are actually try think about this?","Gary Dickerson","","Well, it was probably somewhere in the middle, I think there is a lot of majority in there to what you say because in foundry big technology inflections spreading out to multiple customers. So, I think there is going to be substitute spending driven by capacity but also technology. I think DRAM, when you see DRAM prices pretty good, it would imply, you might have a little upside because utilizations probably run pretty, if you remember they had that fire in China last year at Hynix too. So, DRAM might play for you actually. FLASH, you got to sort through how much capacity is there between planar and VNAND and how much will that might increase their sales because it\u2019s got better endurance reliability, they may increase their addressable market for FLASH. So, the short answer to your question is I think you\u2019re probably right and I think the trends are okay on that.","Michael Sullivan","","Thank you, Ben for your question. And we\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.","Operator","","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. "]}}
